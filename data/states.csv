(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, visiting Alaska this week, said he hopes to learn about challenges facing both the state’s urban centers and remote rural communities.
“I came here to be a great listener, to understand the needs of the people of Alaska, to understand the challenges of the people of Alaska and particularly when it comes to homelessness and affordable housing,” Scott Turner, the Trump administration’s HUD secretary, said at a news conference Tuesday in Anchorage.
Turner is among several Trump administration cabinet members touring Alaska this summer.
He spent part of Tuesday meeting with Anchorage municipal officials who discussed the challenges of homelessness in the state’s largest city.
It is a national issue, Turner said.
That 770,000 people identified as homeless in the nation “is unacceptable to me, it’s unacceptable to my colleagues and I know it’s unacceptable to you,” he said.
In Alaska, he said, almost 2,700 people are homeless, with about 1,700 of them in Anchorage. “That’s something that we want to attack and eradicate,” he said.
Those numbers show that past efforts by HUD to address homelessness have not been effective, said Turner. To make his point, he referred to his background as a professional football player.  
“One of the things that holds you accountable in the NFL is called game film,” he said. “You can say what you want to on Sunday during the game. You can say, ‘Well, I did the right thing,’ but on Monday, the film will tell the story, and the film does not lie.”
On Wednesday, Turner was touring Bethel, in Western Alaska, to learn about rural Alaska housing problems.
Crowding is a dire concern in rural communities, according to the Alaska Housing Finance Corp., a state agency. Conditions are most severe in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, where Bethel is located, according to AHFC. Crowded conditions are linked to poor health, including transmission of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
Turner said HUD wants to add 7 million more units of affordable housing to the national supply and is focused on reducing regulations that reduce housing access in rural areas as well as in urban areas.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, accompanied Turner and asserted at the news conference that overregulation by HUD is one of the major impediments to housing availability and quality in rural parts of the state.
“You can send all the money you want to rural Alaska, but it’s so smothered in red tape that it costs a million bucks to build a duplex. One duplex. A lot of that, I think, is self-inflicted,” Sullivan said.
Other analysis identified different problems for rural Alaska housing.
The high cost of energy in rural communities, which are unconnected to larger power grids, is one problem that for years has been cited as a key factor making rural Alaska housing unaffordable.
However, the budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress at the end of June, along with various actions by the Trump administration, has created new barriers to renewable energy development in rural Alaska and elsewhere.
Climate change has also exacerbated rural Alaska’s housing crisis, according to reports by government agencies.
A 2019 statewide assessment by the Denali Commission found that 144 rural communities are threatened by increased erosion, flooding, permafrost thaw or some combination of those factors.
More frequent flooding in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region, for example, is attributed to climate change and has affected housing quality and safety.
But the Trump administration is seeking to halt in-state policies intended to mitigate and adapt to climate change, including those in Alaska.
The administration also abolished the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Building Resistant Infrastructure and Communities program. The program provided grants to help communities prevent damage from natural disasters, many of which are linked to climate change.

John Hoeven lead a roundtable discussion on enhanced oil recovery on Aug. 13, 2025, in Grand Forks, N.D. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) GRAND FORKS, N.D. — North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven urged the state’s coal and oil industries to work together to thrive in the long term and meet the increasing demand for energy.
Hoeven on Wednesday touted an effort to have the state’s coal plants supply carbon dioxide to the oil industry to help improve the productivity of oil wells and extend the life of coal-fired power plants.
“Today is about linking our coal plants and the Bakken,” Hoeven said, referring to the Bakken shale formation that has helped make North Dakota the nation’s No. 3 oil-producing state.
Hoeven hosted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright at the Energy and Environmental Resource Center in Grand Forks, which performs research for the coal and oil industries.
Hoeven and Wright were joined by energy industry and government representatives, including Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., to discuss how to speed up the development of enhanced oil recovery. The technology uses carbon dioxide or other gases are pumped into an oil well to help force more oil to the surface.
Hoeven likened enhanced oil recovery to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, technologies that helped launch the Bakken oil boom more than a decade ago. Wright was part of the boom as the founder of Liberty Energy.
Using enhanced oil recovery has the potential to improve how much oil can be recovered from an oil well, which currently is between 5% and 15% in the Bakken.
Pilot projects seek to unlock enhanced oil recovery in North Dakota

The EERC this year estimated that injecting CO2 could lead to an additional 5 billion to 8 billion barrels of oil from the Bakken Formation over the next 30 to 50 years. The extra oil production would help ensure steady tax revenues for the state from the oil and gas industry.
Wright credited Hoeven with pushing through changes in the Republican-led megabill  that improve the tax incentives available for using carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery.
The bill included a provision increasing the 45Q tax credit for enhanced oil recovery from $45 per ton of CO2 used to $85 per ton. The increase puts it on par with the tax credit for permanent underground storage of CO2.
Coal plants are seen as one potential source of CO2 but roundtable participants said it will take substantial investments to implement the carbon capture technology.

Robert “Mac” McLennan is the CEO of Minnkota Power Cooperative, which has been developing a carbon capture and sequestration project known as Project Tundra.
Carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery both have been done in North Dakota.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative captures CO2 at its coal gasification plant near Beulah and sends it through a pipeline to an oil field in Canada where it is used for enhanced oil recovery.
“We would rather keep our CO2 in the United States than having to ship it to Canada,” said Ryan Norrell, Basin’s vice president for government relations.
The pipeline passes through some of North Dakota’s prime oil production area.
Enhanced oil recovery also has been used on small-scale test projects in North Dakota.
McLennan said building a large-scale carbon capture and utilization system would likely take  five years.

Oil prices have been on the decline in recent months and the Energy Information Administration on Tuesday released a forecast of declining oil prices through the end of the year.
“We still have some economic uncertainty right now that I think will be cleared up in the next few months,” Wright said. But after that, he predicts a “much more bullish outlook for global demand for oil.”
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who has a background in the oil industry, said there will never be a perfect time to push ahead on enhanced oil recovery.
“If we wait for it to be perfect, it will never happen,” he said.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)More prison beds will be needed as a result of recent legislation, further exacerbating current overcrowding issues in state and county facilities, according to a forecast presented to Arkansas lawmakers Wednesday. 
Wendy Ware, senior vice president of Research, Analysis, and Forecasting for CGL Companies, told a joint meeting of the City, County and Local Affairs Committee the state’s inmate population is projected to grow by an average rate of 2% annually over the next 10 years. Arkansas’ inmate population would increase from about 20,000 today to around 25,000 in 2035, according to the CGL analysis. CGL is a criminal justice facilities management, construction and consulting firm based in Miami, Florida.
The state will need an additional 1,500 to 2,000 through 2040 once the Protect Arkansas Act is fully implemented, Ware said. Among other things, the 2023 law removes the possibility of parole for the state’s most serious offenders. 
Ware discussed CGL’s study during a legislative meeting at the Rogers Convention Center, which was the site of the Arkansas Association of Counties’ annual conference. Sebastian County Sheriff Hobe Runion said county jails have had no choice in holding inmates when there’s no room in state prisons.
Since 2016, county jails have added more that 3,000 beds across the state, partly to accommodate an overflow of state inmates, according to Runion. Yet, they’re still “bursting at the seams” with a backlog of around 1,900. While he’s not sure of the answer, Runion asked lawmakers to help create more bedspace. 
“The wheels, they haven’t come off yet of our criminal justice system, but they are wobbling really hard,” he said. “I’ve been doing this for 35 years, and it scares me.”
Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, noted that many of the county jails that have added space on their own have done so by asking voters to approve new taxes. 
“So I think as legislators, we just need to keep in mind that when we continue to kick the can down the road and don’t figure out ways to solve problems, that what we’re doing ends up raising taxes on a lot of our citizens,” Ray said. 
Many state officials have supported increasing prison capacity, but have disagreed on how to achieve that goal.
Arkansas legislators to hold hearing on Franklin County prison

The biggest source of controversy has been the proposed construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has said the prison is needed to address overcrowding in county jails. Local residents and lawmakers decried the state’s lack of transparency in selecting an 815-acre site near Charleston and have pushed back against the project. 
Sen. Bryan King, a Green Forest Republican and outspoken critic of the Franklin County prison, again raised concerns about the project’s costs Wednesday. The preliminary cost estimate of the prison is $825 million, according to the project’s construction management company, California-based Vanir. 
King specifically discussed concerns about an increase in cost due to a lack of infrastructure for providing enough water to the site. 
“We cannot continue to afford what we’re doing and what we’re spending,” he said. 
The Legislature previously set aside $330 million for the proposed penitentiary, plus another $75 million. Arkansas lawmakers rejected a bill that would have appropriated an additional $750 million for the project during the 2025 legislative session. 
Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace told lawmakers Wednesday more than 1,400 beds have been brought online since Sanders took office in 2023, and officials are exploring more options. 
A women’s health unit with 50 beds is scheduled to open next month, Wallace said. The Board of Corrections also approved an expansion of the Mississippi County work release facility, which will net 100 additional beds, she said.

Instead of giving any real sense of when that impasse might end, the leaders of those respective chambers spent the day pointing fingers and answering lingering questions about the behind the scenes talks – or lack thereof – that might bring it to a close.
On Wednesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) held a planned news conference with other Senate Democratic leaders to again note their position that they were ready to negotiate and wanted get to work on a roads plan, but they could not because House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland) was refusing to show his cards on the full budget. 
That led, in their view, to a communication breakdown in actually negotiating the few House budget ideas that have been reported over the last several months. Still, the House has yet to present its full budget outlook aside from its education plan passed in May, and that was a point of concern.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Later in the day, the Senate Appropriations Committee met to discuss the impacts of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act budget on Michigan’s economy and its own budget process – a drum the Democrats have been steadily beating since details of the bill emerged. The volume of that cadence has only increased since the bill was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. 
Senate Democrats have said they fashioned their budget in a way that contemplated the anticipated impact of Trump’s budget bill, with massive cuts to Medicaid and other key funding. Still, it was possible that new considerations might be made in the negotiating room given the dire circumstances brought on by the federal cuts.
The rallying cry for Senate Democrats on Wednesday was that Hall and his colleagues also now know what the federal budget will mean for the state, and that it was time for them to act with a full budget in tow.
At some point on Wednesday morning, Hall and his Republican colleagues decided to up the ante by announcing an impromptu press conference with the speaker in the afternoon, which included a surprise visit from state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee.
Hall’s main message was his belief that the Democrats were breaking under the weight of their initial opposition to work with the House on roads and that the impasse would soon be over based on pressure from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whom Hall has previously said was more in line with the House Republicans on the budget’s progress than Senate Democrats. But Whitmer last week undermined that narrative, telling Michigan Advance that it was pure posturing.
Despite the day’s verbal grenade throwing, the upshot remains the same: Six weeks have passed since the Legislature’s self-imposed July 1 budget deadline without a new deadline to get it done. Although both chambers readily agreed on Wednesday that schools need to know how they are going to be funded and that a government shutdown would be a loss for both sides, the war of words was far from over.
Brinks and company blast Hall for stalling negotiations – again
In the opening salvo of the day’s budget statement blitzkrieg, Brinks said Democrats in the Senate have done their jobs regarding the budget and that the ball remains in Hall’s court to get a full proposal to the table.
The majority leader said that despite all the political theater and Hall’s sabre rattling on roads, what he was putting at risk was the well-being of children and students across the state.
“Our kids deserve better,” Brinks said. “We have done our part. We’ve crafted a thorough, intentional education budget in a timely manner, without compromising on the priorities that matter most to our schools and to our students.”
The Republican education funding bill, Brinks added, would make deep cuts to areas like literacy supports and free school meals, creating uncertainty and an “impossible situation.”
Brinks laid all that blame at the feet of Hall, as did Democratic state Sen. Darrin Camilleri of Trenton, Sen. Dayna Polehanki of Livonia and Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor.

Camilleri said it was mid-August with no budget and no answers for the people of Michigan.
“It’s pretty embarrassing that we’re in this situation,” Camilleri said, again blaming Hall. “If you act like this at any other job, your boss will put you on a performance improvement plan. But because he’s in a position of power and we are in politics, he thinks his obstruction and arrogance will be rewarded. We cannot let that happen. Matt Hall is losing respect daily in Lansing and across Michigan, and I urge him to get out of his own way for his own benefit, not ours.”
To that point, Camilleri said that Hall was standing in the way of his appropriations chairs and preventing them from having worthwhile discussions with their counterparts to get the budget moving along.
“Hall has tied the house’s hands, blocked us from reaching a compromise, has bottlenecked the entire process, and instead, here we are today without a budget,” Camilleri said. 
Bollin says Hall is not standing in her way
Hall hardly took the bait and remained unfazed in his position that it was the Senate and House Democrats who have thrown schools and the state into perpetual worry, and mostly because he believed the opposing party was unable to get it together on a road funding plan.
Hall’s list of grievances were similar to those expressed in past news conferences, but said the stalemate would end tomorrow if Democrats just took the time to execute on roads. 
He also said that it was not his intention to shut down the government, noting that the House’s supposed government shutdown prevention plan died without action from the Senate.
During the end of the press conference, Bollin walked in the door. It is unclear if her appearance was planned or if it was spurred by the comments from Brinks and other senators earlier in the day.
Either way, the move opened up Bollin to answer questions about whether she truly felt sidelined by Hall in the negotiation process. Bollin, of course, said she was not hindered in any way.
“We are in step with what we’re trying to accomplish with this budget,” Bollin said. “Our subcommittee chairs have had more autonomy and more input in this budget process than in years past. As far as my counterpart in the Senate, I do regularly communicate with Senator Anthony and also talk to the budget director. The speaker is talking on a different level with Senator Brinks, or attempting to, and the governor. We’re all trying to do our work.”
Bollin said people – primarily Democrats – may not like the House Republicans’ new process, and maybe don’t like their current timeline, but Bollin said the caucus’ budget was “going to be realistic.”
“It’s reestablishing priorities, and it’s going to be good value for the taxpayers,” Bollin said. “We’re able to fix the roads, we’re able to put forth sound education dollars without raising taxes, making sure with Medicaid, we have a lot to incorporate.” 
Bollin also defended Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, saying the state will see positive results from that plan.
“I have no doubt that we can put forward a very, very good budget that is realistic and will not be leaving people behind,” Bollin said. “And I hope that the Senate can join us in that effort to get it done soon.”
A possible break in the line of demarcation: ticked off constituents 
For Brinks and her colleagues, the prospect of a government shutdown made them uneasy, but they said the continued pressure on Hall from outside groups was likely a means to break the border line between the two parties.
When asked if it was impossible to get a budget done by the end of August, Brinks said no, and she was hopeful that things would start to turn around. 
On Hall’s insistence that the roads issue was holding everything up, Camilleri said it was a non-starter for his caucus to take billions of dollars from education and put it toward road funding, which he said appears to be the implication of the House’s education cuts.
The effects of Trump’s federal budget could also have an impact on breaking down the wall of stalled progress, as the leaders of the House and Senate have both said they were reexamining the budget outlook in light of federal budget cuts.
Members of the Senate Appropriation took the lead on that Wednesday.
During discussion of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), the committee’s chair, said that it was important for her to convene a group of experts to examine what it all means for Michigan as the budget waits in limbo.
A recent Citizens Research Council report said that the federal bill is projected to blow a $1 billion hole into Michigan’s budget, declining immediate revenues by at least $677 million or upward.
“While President Trump’s actions have made the job of serving Michigan’s people far more challenging – we’re not ones to give up when the going gets tough,” Anthony said in a statement following the meeting. “We’re re-examining the numbers and adjusting our budget to make sure we’re doing everything in our power to keep hardworking Michiganders from bearing the brunt of these dangerous federal cuts.”

In Hall’s view, the will of Senate Democrats has already been broken, at least in his estimation, because they have begun to pass key House policy bills unrelated to the budget.
However, when pressed on the matter by several reporters, including one from the Advance, Hall could not say exactly how the passage of the chamber’s policy bills meant there was now a willingness in the Senate to start having meaningful talks about roads, or the larger budget. He again rested on his belief that Whitmer would corral them into the negotiating room, particularly on the road funding issue.
No matter what happens over the next few weeks, business and school associations appear to have had quite enough.
In a statement that was geared toward the impacts of the federal budget bill and the Senate’s discussion on Wednesday afternoon, Robert McCann, executive director of the K-12 Alliance of Michigan, said the state’s budget breakdown would make those consequences worse, noting that the state’s schools relied on more than $170 million in Medicaid funding last year to deliver “vital” services to students. 
“Unfortunately, Lansing lawmakers are only compounding that damage by refusing to pass a budget that gives our schools even the most basic of funding security for the new school year, even as they reopen their doors to students in the coming days and weeks,” McCann said
Additional pressure came from a coalition of four Michigan business groups, who in a letter sent to Anthony and Bollin on Wednesday, pleaded with the Legislature to not keep funding education programs that help growth, keep students in the talent pipeline and move young people into the much-needed tech jobs of the future.
Leaders from the Detroit Regional Chamber, the Small Business Association of Michigan, TalentFirst and the Michigan Manufacturing Association signed the letter, which noted that education priorities should not become a footnote in the ongoing clash over the budget.
“Michigan still ranks around 33rd in educational attainment, which now leads to a ranking of 39th in income. There is no longer any such thing as a prosperous state that is not also highly educated,” the letter said. “In light of that reality, our concern is growing as Michigan continues to rank toward the bottom of the nation in many key educational metrics.”
Among the talking points in the letter were requests to continue Michigan’s goal of reaching 60% statewide educational attainment by 2030; support efforts to improve a culture valuing education in the state; refocus efforts on improving third-grade reading and math scores; and to expand incentives for dual enrollment and apprenticeship programs.
“To put it in stark terms, when it comes to educational outcomes, Michigan is in dire straits,” the letter said. “Without a significant long-term educational investment and strategy that transcends election results, our state, businesses, and students will continue to fall further behind.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8134881-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-13 20:56:22.911133

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday announced an emergency declaration aimed at dealing with rising crime in the small northern New Mexico town. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued an emergency declaration for the small city of Española and the surrounding area Wednesday, saying local police are overwhelmed with rising crime and drug overdose deaths. In an executive order, the governor authorized state resources, including the National Guard, to help after city, county and Pueblo leaders requested the assistance.
According to the executive order, police calls in Española and surrounding areas have doubled in the last two years, and police dispatches to businesses have quadrupled in that same period. She also cited Rio Arriba County’s high overdose death rate, “with residents struggling with addiction to fentanyl and other illicit substances.” Lujan Grisham’s order also authorized $750,000 in emergency spending.
“When our local leaders called for help to protect their communities, we responded immediately with decisive action,” Lujan Grisham said in a news release announcing the executive order. “We are making every resource available to support our local partners on the ground and restore public safety and stability to these areas that have been hardest hit by this crisis.”
Lauren Thorp, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, told Source NM the order is meant to help local, county and tribal police pay for “officer overtime, public safety equipment, and multi-agency interventions to address the surge in violent crime and drug trafficking.”
“This coordinated approach addresses the interconnected challenges of crime, overdoses, and community instability that have strained local capacity beyond their limits,” Thorp said in an email. 
There is no “immediate” assignment to deploy the National Guard, Thorp said, but that standard language in the governor’s executive order “is there if needed.” 
Guard spokesperson Hank Minitrez also confirmed that. “Guard hasn’t been tasked with any mission,” he said in a text message.
The governor signed a similar executive order in April that authorized National Guard troops to assist law enforcement in Albuquerque, the state’s biggest city. The governor’s April declaration in Albuquerque drew denunciations from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico.
In that order, she also authorized $750,000 in emergency spending because she said Albuquerque was “experiencing a significant increase in crime” and requested help because it, too, did not have adequate resources to respond.
But unlike the Albuquerque executive order that directed the emergency funding directly to the National Guard, the Española order directs the funds to the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, an agency that typically helps residents respond to wildfires, floods or other natural disasters. 
Thorp provided Source recent letters from the Santa Clara and Ohkay Owingeh pueblos, along with Española and Rio Arriba County officials, asking the state to assist. She also forwarded along a series of charts from the Española Social Services Department director, Michelle Fraire, who said that the city has already seen 49 overdoses, compared with 40 in all of 2024.
“I predict this number will continue to increase and more than double,” Fraire wrote, according to the materials the governor’s office provided.
Danielle Silva, a spokesperson for Homeland Security, told Source that the department is receiving the funding to coordinate various state agencies, like it does after a natural disaster, to assist local officials dealing with the increased crime.
“We’re kind of dealing with the state as a whole trying to figure out a multi-faceted response,” she said. “The details on that need to be fleshed out with the locals, but they asked for help so we’ll figure out how to do it.”
Silva said “housing and other public safety” are examples of how the state’s various agencies might be able to assist the communities.
Española Police Chief Mizel Garcia told Source the reason why the city asked for help is because it doesn’t have enough police officers to respond to a spike in crimes committed by young people and crimes involving guns.
“We lose a lot of officers to bigger agencies that pay more and offer more benefits,” Garcia said in an interview. “The issue for us is the availability of resources.”
The city of just over 10,000 people cannot generate as much in tax revenue as larger cities, he said.
Española borders the Pueblos of Ohkay Owingeh to the north and Santa Clara to the south, which the order says are also experiencing “a significant increase in crime.”
Garcia said it is premature to say what the funding will be used for, and that will be determined once his agency can have a meeting with the Rio Arriba County Sheriff’s Office and the Ohkay Owingeh and Santa Clara tribal police departments to develop a plan of action.
“Many parts within the city of Española are within the jurisdiction of our tribal agencies, so this isn’t just for my department, this is something that’s joint,” Garcia said. Including the New Mexico State Police, there are five different police agencies that can respond to calls in the city, he said.
Española officials said at a town hall meeting on crime and organized by the governor last summer that they were having trouble recruiting local police officers, given that Los Alamos National Laboratories offered similar candidates much higher pay.
At the same town hall, residents were divided about what the city should do about an unhoused encampment that grew alongside the Rio Grande in town. City officials cleared the encampment shortly after the meeting, drawing an outcry. 
In the Albuquerque executive order, the governor authorized up to 70 National Guard soldiers to arrive in the city of about 560,000. They were dressed in plain clothes and were instructed to help APD with “non-law enforcement” activities including traffic control, administrative duties, transporting incarcerated people, court security, emergency response and “other critical functions that allow local law enforcement to focus on crime reduction efforts.”
The National Guard remains in Albuquerque, since the governor reauthorized its presence. The state has spent at least $2 million to keep it there.

Andy Beshear’s Pre-K for All Advisory Committee in Kentucky. 
  Alabama state Rep. Jeana Ross
Rep. Jeana Ross, a former educator and former secretary of her state’s Department of Early Childhood Education, said Alabama’s pre-K program “has survived Democratic and Republican governors” and has “always been a bipartisan program with bipartisan support and strong local and community support as well.” 
Ross was key in creating Alabama’s program at a time when research about brain development in young children was receiving more attention, she said. 
“It became evident that (in) these early years, a lot was going on,” Ross said. “The brain development and the experiences that children had early absolutely set their trajectory for the rest of their lives.” 
The committee also heard from Steven Barnett, the founder and senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, who said that children who attend pre-kindergarten are more likely to be ready for kindergarten, be healthier and live longer. 
During the session that convenes in January, Kentucky lawmakers will adopt the next two-year state budget. That probably will be Beshear’s last chance to win funding for pre-K for all Kentucky 4-year-olds, a proposal he has unsuccessfully pushed with the Republican-controlled legislature. Kentucky governors are limited to two terms, and Beshear’s second term ends in 2027. 
Democrat Beshear renews push for universal preschool in Kentucky

In June, he signed an executive order establishing the advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky. 
During Wednesday’s Zoom meeting, the committee learned about what other states have done in public preschool programs. 
Barnett said  pre-K has a domino effect on multiple parts of life. 
“If you set those kinds of things up, you can then produce substantial improvements in later achievement, decreases in the need for special education, decreased failure and grade retention, and those things lead to increased educational attainment, more high school graduation, more post secondary enrollment,” Barnett told the committee.“Once you have that higher educational achievement, a whole host of other benefits follow: less crime, higher earnings, better jobs, better health. People will actually live longer.”
  Steven Barnett
During his weekly press conference Wednesday, Beshear said that since establishing the committee, people have sent more than 22,000 emails to legislators expressing support for universal pre-K in Kentucky. 
The committee has also held town halls in Bowling Green, Morehead, Frankfort and Northern Kentucky, which were “incredibly successful” and “very well attended,” according to Sam Flynn, the executive director for the Team Kentucky Pre-K for All Program. 
“It’s a no-brainer: Everybody wins by making pre-K accessible to every 4-year-old Kentucky child, including our businesses, our families, our kids and our economy,” Beshear said. One in five Kentucky children currently live in poverty. 
Beshear also cited recently published research that found parents benefit in their careers by having access to universal pre-K for their children. 
Flynn said “a significant number of” school superintendents in the state have “either reached out to us — or we’ve spoken directly to them — saying how much they support this.”

‘Be very brave’ 
From the beginning of Alabama’s work to make a successful pre-K program, Ross said, it was important to communicate “the importance of early childhood education and what it meant for our communities in our state as a whole.” 
Additionally, she said, “we knew that if the quality was not there, you may be doing more harm than good. So the quality was critical, and we built that from day one.” 
The committee chose to examine Alabama because of the state’s similar characteristics to Kentucky. It also looked at Georgia and Iowa. 
Andrea Day, a division director for the Department for Community Based Services, within the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said that Alabama and Georgia residents spend the lowest percentage of their income on child care for 4-year-olds. Kentuckians, in contrast, spend the most — 10% of annual income for one child, Day said. 
  Source: Pre-K for All Advisory Committee
To launch a successful pre-K program, Ross said, states have to “be very brave and take a few risks.” 
In Kentucky, about 63% of Kentucky’s children ages 3 and 4 were not in school from 2019-2023, an increase from 58% from 2014-2018. In 2024, 67% of Kentucky’s fourth graders were less than proficient in reading. That’s up from 65% in 2019. 
That same year, most — 76% — of eighth graders in the state weren’t proficient in math, up from 71% in 2019. From 2021-2022, 10% of high school students did not graduate on time, an increase from 9% in 2019, according to the report. 
Alabama’s voluntary pre-K program has not achieved universal enrollment  despite being recognized for its high quality.
Alabama was able to show that students who went through pre-K education were less likely to need special education services and more likely to attend class when they entered K-12, Ross said. 
“By the time they left that program, not only did they catch up, but they were ready for kindergarten,” Ross said. “And we could prove it.”

(Ian Karbal/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Six weeks after the constitutionally-mandated deadline for state lawmakers to deliver a budget, a standoff between the two chambers seems as intractable as ever. 
And with no action, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) says they’ll move forward with planned cuts to service later this month. The reductions could impact up to 800,000 people who use the transit system daily. 
House Democrats shot down a $47.6 billion budget proposal Wednesday that had cleared the GOP-controlled Senate late the night before by a party line vote, effectively prolonging the stalemate. 
The Senate’s proposal is about $3 billion less than the one that passed the House last month. The big differences include how to fund public education and different mechanisms for public transportation funding. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
House Appropriations Committee Minority Chair Ryan Bizarro (R-Erie) described the GOP-backed budget as more or less a stop-gap, allowing school districts and safety net services to continue functioning. 
To Appropriations Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia), the proposal shows his Republican colleagues lack urgency, even as the threat of a prolonged standoff has community service providers and county officials scrambling.
“The only time you use numbers from last year is early on in the process, to move the process forward until you get an agreed upon number,” Harris said. “This is not something that you do a month-and-a-half after that. Literally last year’s numbers –  [that’s] a spending plan that says, ‘We’re not serious.’”
Gov. Josh Shapiro struck a more optimistic tone when speaking with reporters at Ag Progress Days in Centre County on Wednesday afternoon.

“I would not say that we’re far apart,” Shapiro said. “I spent a good bit of time last night with the leader of Democratic caucus, and I spent two hours this morning with the Senate Republican leader, Senator Pittman.”
“We’re making progress,” he added. “I actually thought that the move yesterday in the Senate brought us closer, because what it did was it made clear that the Senate is committed to funding mass transit, which has been a priority of mine.”
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford/Fulton), however, said Shapiro should get more involved with negotiations. 
Though Topper acknowledged urgency may be increasing, he said that no budget would be passed until lawmakers embrace “a sense of reality … We’re getting a state budget when the realism sets in for everyone as to what the state can afford moving forward.”
The proposal rejected by House Democrats funneled $300 million in state gaming revenue to help prevent SEPTA service cuts and pay for road and bridge projects throughout the commonwealth. 
Public transportation entities in rural, suburban and urban areas get money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund earmarked separately for operations and capital.
Under the Senate’s plan from Tuesday, they could transfer some of those capital funds to pay for operations.

Absent a deal by Thursday, SEPTA’s planning to reduce service by 20 percent starting Aug. 24. But according to General Manager Scott Sauer, the Republican-backed bill would not have staved off the cuts. 
“The use of capital dollars for operating does not solve our problem,” Sauer told the House Rules Committee Wednesday afternoon. “It creates a new one.”
Namely, delaying crucial operating initiatives, he said. 
Among the projects that SEPTA says they fund with the money that would have gone to their operating budget, are a long-term train car modernization project. Some of their regional rail cars are more than 50 years old, and, according to Sauer, have led to fires and potentially unsafe conditions for riders. The multi-year replacement project is expected to cost around $1.8 billion over roughly 10 years, according to Sauer. 
They’d also have to increase fares – unless they can get a waiver – in line with the Consumer Price Index next year, in 2027 and then biannually. SEPTA and Pittsburgh Regional Transit would face more stringent accountability and performance requirements as well.

The bill has criminal justice components, too, including making the SETPA special prosecutor role permanent and cracking down on drug dealing and assaults on operators.
Transit funding under the latest House proposal would entail diverting another 1.75 percent of sales tax, which Republicans oppose.
The two proposed budget plans also differ on education, with the Senate’s proposal keeping funding at a flat rate. 
Specifically, it would distribute $500 million through a funding formula established last year to benefit underfunded school districts, after the Commonwealth Court found the previous funding method unconstitutionally inequitable. Democrats say that last year’s funding was only a first step towards remedying the situation, and that flat funding might run afoul of the court’s ruling. They called for an additional $526 million in the House budget.
It’s unclear what will happen next, or when a budget will be ready. The House has scheduled Appropriations Committee meetings every day through the rest of the month, though it’s unlikely they will meet for them all. 
House leaders and Shapiro have also said negotiations continue. But as it stands, both sides, while acknowledging they’ll have to compromise, appear to be dug in for now.
The longer the fight drags out, the more transit agencies in rural, urban and suburban areas, government services and county operations will face cuts, impacting Pennsylvanians and their communities
“There’s a willingness now, it looks like, in both chambers, to recognize the challenge,” House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) told reporters. “Now we’ve gotta fill in some of the blanks and realize not everyone’s going to get what they want.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has issued yet another call to the Utah Legislature to more seriously consider funding requests to bolster the state’s homeless system. 
The mayor held a news conference on Wednesday hours after the Utah Office of Homeless Services released its annual report — which showed an 18% increase in the number of Utahns experiencing homelessness on a single night in January, according to the 2025 Point-in-Time Count. 
That number “should be heard as a battle cry,” Mendenhall said outside City Hall, “to bring more energy, focus and leadership to this issue by our state Legislature.” 
Utah homelessness rose 18% in 2025, state report says

“I want to be clear that I’m standing here before you today because I’m deeply concerned about the trajectory of homelessness in the state of Utah and in our capital city,” she said. “And once more, I’m extremely concerned by the lack of forward momentum from legislative leaders to address this growing statewide crisis.”
On Wednesday, Mendenhall pointed to the state’s newly released homelessness data as evidence that the state’s homeless system is facing growing needs. That report also showed the number of Utah children experiencing homelessness increased by 22% and the number of unhoused Utahns over the age of 64 rose 42%.
“To our state leaders, your partners are here. We are ready and willing to work with you. And the changes that are needed are clear,” Mendenahall said, noting that city leaders have made a proposal to increase homeless shelter capacity, but it lacks state funding. 
“As your partners, we have a plan for 1,300 more shelter beds. We have made land available, yet as of today, we have only one-third of the capital funding needed to build the first phase, and not a penny of operational capital.”

‘Our citizens expect results, not finger-pointing,’ governor and legislative leaders say
In response to Mendenhall’s call, however, Utah’s top Republican leaders — Gov. Spencer Cox, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper — issued a joint statement saying the state has invested hundreds of millions in homeless services in recent years. And they urged Mendenhall to “turn down the politics.”
“Over the past five years, the state has made the largest investment in homeless services in our state’s history, spending more than $266 million on addressing homelessness. That includes setting aside $25 million to build a transformative campus,” Cox, Adams and Schultz said.
They added that across the nation, “addressing homelessness is primarily a city and county responsibility, but in Utah, the state has stepped up as a committed partner, working alongside local governments and the private sector to find real solutions.”
“The state remains committed to enhancing public safety and maintaining order, but lasting solutions require collaboration and partnership from the city, county and private sector leaders,” they added. 
While Cox, Adams and Schultz said they’ve been “encouraged” by newly-appointed Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd’s efforts to improve safety in Salt Lake City, “it’s frustrating to continuously take one step forward and two steps back with Salt Lake City.”
“The city needs to stay focused on its core responsibility of protecting its citizens, keeping streets safe and clean and making our capital a place Utahns can be proud of and visitors want to experience,” they said. “We urge Mayor Mendenhall to turn down the politics and keep working with us to find practical and lasting solutions to this complex issue. Our citizens expect results, not finger-pointing.”

‘Salt Lake City is making good on our part’
This marks the second time in less than a month that the mayor of Utah’s capital city has called on the Republican-controlled Legislature to take city requests more seriously for more funding to more holistically address crime, substance abuse, affordable housing and homeless services.
Last month, Mendenhall said she was “disappointed” in the lack of progress from the Legislature to adhere to a list of recommendations she included the public safety plan she presented in response to demands from state leaders, who had grown frustrated with crime, drugs and illegal camping in Salt Lake City ahead of the 2025 Legislature. 
With public safety update, ‘disappointed’ SLC mayor asks state to take city requests more seriously

The mayor on Wednesday again pointed to her public safety plan and the actions the Salt Lake City Police Department took to increase enforcement and address homelessness.
“Salt Lake City is making good on our part,” she said. “But the reality is, this is a humanitarian crisis. This is not something we can police our way out of. … Salt Lake City is taking enforcement as far as we can, and to little avail.”
The mayor said Salt Lake City police are on pace to set records for total arrests this year, “thanks in part to increased proactive policing by our officers.” She also noted that overall citywide crime remains at or below a 16-year low.
“We are enforcing our laws,” she said, “but the sad reality is that without more mental health treatment, more shelter beds, more permanent supportive housing and more capacity in our jails, too many people remain on our streets.” 
Mendenhall said it should come as no surprise that the state’s homeless population is increasing “due to financial and economic pressures” along with a longstanding housing shortage and home and rental prices that have skyrocketed over the past five years.
“There are simply not enough options for housing, shelter beds, treatment centers or social services to meet the demand in this state,” she said.
The 2026 Utah Legislature’s general session is scheduled to convene on Jan. 20. Acknowledging that’s months away, Mendenhall said the need is “startling,” so she’s issuing the call now. 
“I’m telling you now, in the middle of our warmest months, that the situation is dire,” she said. 
Funding for winter shelter beds expected to run out in April
Mendenhall said local leaders have already started trying to prepare for this winter’s emergency shelter response, but they’re anticipating a lack of funding to open enough beds, which she said “should be upsetting to all of us.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“There won’t be enough beds,” she said, adding that counties are submitting winter response plans for state approval, but “I’m very doubtful that those beds will be available. So we almost assuredly will have people on the streets with no option of space to go.”
Mendenhall, who sits as a voting member on the Utah Homeless Services Board, said the Utah Office of Homeless Services “does not have funding to continue those beds” beyond April, though that office has kept about 900 winter shelter beds open into this summer “because they had the funding from the Legislature to do so.”
But beyond this coming winter season, the money will dry up — unless lawmakers approve more. 
“So come the end of the winter shelter season, everyone who’s in one of the 900-plus beds that were created this year would be out on the streets,” she said. “And the impact in our downtown core, throughout our neighborhoods and parks and trail system, of 1,000-plus people flooding out with no option of places to go is very alarming.” 
There’s not enough money to build homeless campus, mayor says
Mendenhall also reiterated her warning last month that “progress has stalled” in the effort to create a 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus “due to inadequate funding to build and non-existent funding to operate a new campus shelter.” 
State can officially use eminent domain to site a new homeless campus. What now?

“This is unacceptable,” she said. “I’m calling on our state leaders to recognize the crisis at hand. Step in to join your willing partners in local government, and lead the passage of legislation that will invest both the capital and ongoing operational funding for a new shelter space.”
Efforts to site and build that homeless campus are still ongoing, but state officials don’t expect it to be built in time for the coming winter. Last fall, the Utah Homeless Services Board set a deadline of Oct. 1, 2025 for the campus to be built, but State Homeless Coordinator Wayne Niederhauser said the siting process is taking longer than expected.
“We are working hard,” Niederhauser told Utah News Dispatch earlier this week, but he said it could be a matter of months before state leaders can finish environmental evaluations on properties they are considering — something he said must be done before state leaders decide whether to move forward with eminent domain powers granted by the 2025 Utah Legislature specifically to site the homeless campus. 
Niederhauser, however, acknowledged the “need is huge.” 
“We appreciate the acute need, the serious need of this,” he said. “So we’re not letting grass grow under our feet. We’re working hard to find a pathway.” 
The Utah Office of Homeless Services is also working on drafting funding recommendations to include in Gov. Spencer Cox’s budget proposal that’s usually issued in December. But in recent years, the Utah Legislature has only funded a fraction of what the governor has requested for homeless services. 
Cox calls for mental health care expansion on Utah State Hospital’s 140th anniversary

For 2025, Cox initially sought $128 million for homelessness, but in the end lawmakers funded $50 million in additional state spending for emergency shelter, including $25 million for “low barrier shelter.” Some of that was used to keep winter shelter beds open, while some is also supposed to be used to site and build the new homeless campus. 
But that’s not enough money to both build and fund ongoing operations for the new homeless campus, Mendenhall warned, urging lawmakers to appropriate more. 
She said over the coming months, city leaders will work with the Utah Office of Homeless Services, the courts system, and Salt Lake County officials will be working to “bring legislative requests that are needed to right the wrongs in the system that exist today.” 
“But,” she said, “there are no wheels on the bus that we present unless the state moves us forward. We must see action from legislative leadership and our governor to create the change that we know is not only possible, but is desperately needed.”

A federal judge in Rhode Island has sided with a coalition of domestic violence support groups, including one in Pennsylvania, in momentarily barring the federal government from enforcing a newly imposed set of restraints on Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants.
Senior District Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued his 27-page ruling on Friday, Aug. 8, granting the preliminary stay requested by the plaintiffs — an assembly of 17 state-level coalitions who work with domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence is part of the suit.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The preliminary stay halts the Office on Violence Against Women, an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice which distributes the VAWA grants, from instituting conditions the agency was set to apply to grant applications starting Tuesday, Aug. 12. The funding policy change would require grant applicants to align their projects and services with President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging directives to discontinue federal funding of DEI and what the administration calls “gender ideology.”
“This order is a critical step toward protecting survivors and ensuring that communities across the country can continue to provide the services Congress mandated,” the plaintiffs said in a joint statement issued Friday. “The administration’s attempt to politicize essential funding that supports survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault was not just unlawful, it was cruel.”
The plaintiffs’ legal team included attorneys from Democracy Forward, the ACLU of Rhode Island, the National Women’s Law Center, the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, and Daniel Jacobson, a former counsel for the U.S. Office of Management and Budget during the Biden administration, and now head of Jacobson Lawyers Group.
Jacobson and Democracy Forward’s Kristen Bateman made their case during a July 29 hearing before Smith, arguing that the Office on Violence Against Women violated the Administrative Procedure Act by unlawfully instituting the new funding conditions.

The organizations who rely on these funds, the attorneys argued, would see their work imperiled if they had to forgo federal funding critical to their operations. Applicants also had to certify adherence with the new restrictions, which attorneys argued could trigger future federal prosecution under the False Claims Act.
Smith agreed in his ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on at least one of their Administrative Procedure Act claims. There was not enough evidence for the court to conclude whether or not the restrictions are fundamentally invalid, Smith wrote. But, the judge argued, administrative law is designed to provide clear reasoning for the actions taken by federal agencies — something absent in the office’s adoption of the new funding conditions.
“The Court understands that this matter arises on an expedited basis, and perhaps a fuller administrative record will disclose more of the Office’s decisionmaking process,” Smith wrote. “But on the present record, the Court can only conclude that the Office engaged in a wholly under-reasoned and arbitrary process.”
Smith’s ruling returned several times to a court document he had discussed at the July 29 hearing: a declaration from Ginger Baran Lyons, the deputy director of the Office on Violence Against Women, that was filed on behalf of the federal government’s case.
“The Office provides, as the only basis for its decision, a single declaration by an Office supervisory official,” Smith wrote. “While helpful, that declaration is not a substitute for an administrative record.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During the hearing, Smith noted that Lyons’ declaration painted a vastly different landscape of how her office would interpret the new funding conditions, compared to the conditions’ actual language. Smith underlined that disconnect in his ruling, writing that the plaintiff groups would only find “cold comfort” in the agency’s reassurance that it would not treat survivors of violence differently than it has in the past.
“In the context of this case and the present Administration,” Smith wrote, “the words of President Ronald Reagan have never rang more true: ‘The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the Government, and I’m here to help.’”
Smith was also unmoved by the feds’ arguments that the office “would be ‘unlikely to recover the grant funds once they are disbursed,’” and that “the public . . . has an interest in the judiciary respecting the Executive Branch’s ability to lawfully direct and guide agencies’ spending decisions.”
The relief sought by the coalitions, Smith noted, did not require any disbursement of grant funds, just a shift in the conditions attached to them.
“And speaking of respect,” Smith added, “the public has an interest in the Executive respecting the Legislature’s spending decisions.”

(Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife/Flickr)Conservation groups are again going to court as part of a nearly two-decade-long fight to protect a small forest-dwelling rodent native to the Oregon Coast.
The Center For Biological Diversity, Cascadia Wildlands, Oregon Wild and the Bird Alliance Of Oregon sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on July 17 in U.S. District Court in Portland over the agency’s decision not to provide the north Oregon Coast red tree vole federal Endangered Species Act protections. The suit names the agency’s director, Paul Souza, and Doug Burgum, head of the U.S. Department of the Interior, as defendants.
The suit is the latest in an ongoing effort since 2007 to protect red tree voles, which live in the canopy of old growth conifer forests and feed on the needles of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce and western hemlock trees.
The small, mouse-sized animals with reddish-brown fur traditionally lived in forests along the coasts of Northern California and all along the Oregon Coast. But they’ve seen their habitat reduced by roughly 65% since 1986 due to logging and wildfires in the forests they depend on, according to a 2023 study from the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, which Trump officials announced they will close. The protections conservationists seek are for a distinct population of red tree vole that now only lives in northwestern Oregon.
“Red tree voles have graced Oregon’s coastal old-growth forests for thousands of years, but we could lose them forever if they don’t get Endangered Species Act protections soon,” said Ryan Shannon, attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.
The group in 2007 petitioned Fish and Wildlife to add the vole to its Threatened and Endangered Species List, which would have applied a number of protective measures meant to preserve the voles’ habitat, likely including logging restrictions in old growth areas along the northern Oregon Coast. Four years later, agency officials agreed that protecting the voles was “warranted” but ruled that other species had higher priority for listing.
For about a decade between 2011 and 2019, Fish and Wildlife continued to consider adding the red tree vole to the Threatened and Endangered Species List, insisting on five separate occasions that listing it was “warranted” but precluded by higher priority species that needed more urgent protection. But in 2019, the agency officially reversed course and denied listing it. The Center for Biological Diversity sued, and Fish and Wildlife officials agreed in a settlement to reconsider listing the vole.
But in February of 2024, Fish and Wildlife officials again determined the Oregon Coast red tree vole did not warrant listing as an endangered or threatened species, in part because the species is considered adept at moving to find new habitat when it loses its current habitat.
The lawsuit against the agency argues the decision deprives the population of coastal voles of “critical protections necessary to ensure its continued survival and recovery, fails to follow the best available science, and is arbitrary and capricious.”
The decline in red tree voles has cascading effects. The voles are prey for northern spotted owls, who are federally listed as threatened and also rely on old-growth forests for their survival.
“Red tree voles are an important indicator species of forest health,” said Bethany Cotton, conservation director for Cascadia Wildlands, in a statement. “Their decline should be a wake-up call to us all to better care for our remaining mature and old-growth forests.”

(Photo via Getty Images)JBS USA announced Wednesday it had reached an agreement to purchase an Ankeny facility, previously owned by Hy-Vee, to build out a ready-to-eat bacon and sausage facility. 
According to a press release from the company, the 186,000-square-foot facility will be the largest of its kind in the JBS portfolio and will create approximately 400 jobs, once fully operational.
The purchase and required facility enhancements represent a $100 million investment, according to the release. The plant is expected to be operational by mid-2026 following capital investments and construction.

The facility was previously the Fresh Commissary, which made sandwiches, salads, bakery items and take-and-bake pizzas for Hy-Vee stores. Hy-Vee announced in April it was closing the facility that employed more than 300 people.
JBS plans to hire employees who previously worked at the facility under Hy-Vee, “due to the type of work,” the press release said. 
JBS is also planning a sausage-making facility in nearby Perry. With the two new locations, JBS will have five plants in Iowa. Other plants are in Council Bluffs, Marshalltown and Ottumwa.
“This facility in Ankeny will not only expand our prepared foods business in the U.S., it will also benefit from synergies and strategic supply of product from our other plants in the region,” Rick Foster, JBS’s U.S. head of prepared foods, said in a statement. 
According to the release, the Perry location will supply raw sausage to the Ankeny facility to be cooked and packaged as ready-to-eat. 
Wesley Batista Filho, CEO of JBS USA, said the company is “proud to grow our operations in Iowa.” 
JBS also operates a ready-to-eat bacon facility in Moberly, Missouri, and said there is “increasing consumer demand” for the ready-to-eat pork products. 
“Today’s announcement aligns with our long-term strategy of offering more value-added and prepared foods products to meet the needs of our customers and consumers,” Batista Filho said in the release.

Luna-Perez is accused of killing a woman and her daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood. (Tim Hawk for New Jersey Monitor)TOMS RIVER — The detention hearing for the undocumented immigrant accused in a deadly Lakewood crash was delayed Wednesday after his lawyers asked for more time to address immigration issues tied to the case, which has been the focus of White House attacks on Gov. Phil Murphy.
Raul Luna-Perez, 43, is accused of driving drunk on July 26 and crossing into oncoming traffic, causing a head-on collision that killed a woman and her 11-year-old daughter. The Trump administration has said Murphy, a Democrat, is to blame because of a state sanctuary policy for undocumented immigrants.
 Superior Court Judge Guy Ryan speaks during the detention hearing for Raul Luna-Perez on Aug. 13, 2025. (Tim Hawk for New Jersey Monitor)
Appearing before Superior Court Judge Guy P. Ryan in Ocean County, attorneys for Luna-Perez said Wednesday they wanted to delay the detention hearing “in light of immigration issues.” Ryan rescheduled it for Monday afternoon.
New Jersey’s bail reform law requires prosecutors to argue to a judge that defendants in some criminal cases should be jailed before trial. A separate judge on July 31 freed Luna-Perez and ordered him confined to his home pending trial, but a second detention hearing was scheduled after Ocean County prosecutors filed additional charges against him.
“Our attorneys are committed to fulfilling their obligations under the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Padilla v. Kentucky and are diligently working to provide Mr. Luna-Perez with the required legal advice to fulfill that obligation,” Cristina LiBassi of the state Office of the Public Defender, which is representing Luna-Perez, said in a statement.
In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that defense attorneys must inform non-citizen clients about the immigration and deportation consequences of guilty pleas.
Luna-Perez was initially charged with two counts each of vehicular homicide and assault by auto, and prosecutors later charged him with two counts each of aggravated manslaughter and strict liability vehicular homicide. Police say his blood alcohol content was nearly three times the legal limit at the time of the crash.
After Luna-Perez’s arrest, the Trump administration pinned the blame for the deaths of Maria Pleitez, 42, and her 11-year-old daughter, Dayanara, on Murphy. The state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which restricts cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents, is to blame for shielding Luna-Perez from deportation, the Trump administration has said. Luna-Perez has two prior arrests from earlier this year on drunken driving charges, and he was the subject of a 2023 domestic violence complaint that was later withdrawn, according to court officials.
“Governor Murphy and his sanctuary policies released this serial criminal into New Jersey communities,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said last week.
Murphy, asked about the Trump administration’s criticism at an unrelated event Wednesday, called the fatal crash “a tragedy that should have been avoided.”
“He shouldn’t have been on the road, and frankly, he shouldn’t have been in the country. I’ve been unequivocally firm about that. So, frankly, I don’t have a lot of disagreement,” he said.
Murphy declined to comment further.
The state Attorney General’s Office said last week that the Immigrant Trust Directive did not bar state law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials to deport Luna-Perez. The directive allows for cooperation regarding undocumented immigrants facing some serious and violent charges, including assault.
Luna-Perez’s immigration status was not discussed at the July 31 detention hearing.
A driving record for Luna-Perez obtained through a public records request shows his driver’s license was in good standing. He was cited for speeding in November.

The report found that the university appeared to pay Bannock County funds improperly in order to avoid reverting the unspent money to the state. The issue may go to Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador for further investigation.

The Legislative Services Office released the audit report Wednesday, which was too limited in scope to conclude malfeasance, Auditor April Renfro wrote in the audit summary, but facts that “may indicate misappropriation of public funds” were forwarded to the state’s chief litigator for further consideration. 
Labrador’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on if an investigation will be pursued. 
“ISU paid an invoice for $853,700 from Bannock County that was not supported by evidence of allowable expenses and appeared to have been directed and submitted to avoid reverting unspent general funds to the State of Idaho, as required,” the report said. 
ISU President Robert Wagner and Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Steele responded in a letter that the university “takes seriously the findings of the audit and its recommendations for use of public funds.” 
“We acknowledge the concerns raised in the report and agree to continue to implement measures to ensure appropriate accountability for financial transactions,” the university leaders wrote. 
 Audit spurred by Idaho senator and a conservative think tank IFF article 

The funds originated from a 2022 budget bill to the university for a proposed East Idaho Forensic Pathology Center, which would have been built on ISU’s campus and operated by Bannock County. 
The Legislature provided $900,000 for initial costs incurred on the project; ISU spent $46,300 in design consultation and cost estimates, ISU spokesperson Emily Frandsen told the Idaho Capital Sun for a previous story. 
The university on April 20, 2023, paid Bannock County the remaining $853,700 for the project but didn’t specify what those costs related to, the report said. The project eventually stalled because of the high costs for construction and to run autopsies, the Sun reported. 
Idaho senator alleges misuse of funds from ISU, Bannock County over forensic center

In November 2024, the conservative think tank Idaho Freedom Foundation published an article citing public records showing that the funds were never reverted back to the state. Sen. Glenneda Zuiderveld, R-Twin Falls, that same month sent out a press release alleging ISU misappropriated the funds for the defunct project and calling for an investigation, the Sun reported. 
The report cited the IFF article and emails showing that the university appeared “concerned about ensuring appropriation was not reverted to the Idaho State General Fund by stating that ‘“we need to expend the $900K state appropriation to ISU by June 30, 2023. We think the cleanest path forward is for the county to invoice us for the $900K.’” 
The invoice did not include details on what costs were incurred that it was for, as required by the bill providing the funds, House Bill 776. 
“We found no evidence that ISU attempted to obtain additional documentation to support the
expenditure or to recover the funds until after the media and Legislature began asking questions,” the report said. 
 ISU has taken steps to address findings in report

The report found that ISU employees interpreted the money as “pass-through” funds for the county, which was “problematic” because that is not how they were indicated on the legislation appropriating the money. 
Bannock County in late 2024 and early 2025 returned the money through two checks totaling $853,700, to ISU, which then sent the money back to the state treasury, the report said. 
The audit provided two recommendations to the university: develop and follow written procedures for proper monitoring and compliance with appropriation laws, and improve internal controls to ensure payments are supported by appropriate documentation and actual expenditures. 
In February of this year, the university created an Appropriations Tracking and Oversight Team, meant to ensure state money is expended in full compliance with the legislative intent and law. University leaders cited the new team in its response letter and said they had implemented “new procedures.”

The state Democratic Party called on McLeod to suspend his campaign after reviewing the video. (Screenshot from Charleston Police Department dashcam)The chair of South Carolina’s Democratic Party is calling on Mullins McLeod to discontinue his campaign for governor and focus on his mental health after his 35-minute, profanity-laden rant in the back of a police cruiser became public.
“It is clear the Mr. McLeod is navigating profound challenges and should focus on his mental and emotional well-being instead of a campaign for governor,” state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain said in a statement Wednesday.
Her plea came hours after The Post and Courier first reported on the dashcam video and two days after McLeod became the first Democrat to enter the 2026 governor’s race.
It appears McLeod is not heeding Spain’s advice, with his campaign manager telling the SC Daily Gazette he won’t back away.
“Everything is straight ahead,” said Democratic strategist Cary Cranford. He declined to address McLeod’s mental health.
McLeod did not respond to messages Wednesday left by the SC Daily Gazette. Nor did his criminal defense attorney.
The dashcam video comes from McLeod’s arrest in May on disorderly conduct charges. In it, the 53-year-old personal injury attorney jumps incoherently from one grievance to the next — shouting expletives and accusations for the entire ride against a variety of state and federal lawmakers and using a racial slur. He repeatedly threatens people he doesn’t like — saying he’ll kick their teeth in or let someone else do it — and occasionally yells out “McLeod for governor!”
The high-profile lawyer’s arrest, which made headlines in May, did not stop the Democrat from launching his bid Monday for the Governor’s Mansion. In his three-minute campaign video posted to YouTube, he rails again “corruption” at the Statehouse. Asked Monday about his arrest, he disputed the police report but declined to go into details. However, he pledged to fully explain what happened before voters go to the polls.
Dash camera footage released from Charleston Police showed what happened after he was placed in the back seat of the cruiser. The department released the video, first to The Post and Courier and then to the SC Daily Gazette, in response to public records requests.
Charleston lawyer becomes first Democrat to enter 2026 SC governor’s race

The video starts with McLeod rambling about class-action lawsuits and little money going to victims. When an officer asks for his name, he says all that matters is that he’s “one of the most just humans to ever walk this soil.” When the officer calls him John Doe, McLeod says he’d rather go by Superman.
Once the door closes, he seemingly tells himself, “I can’t connect these dots yet, but if this is going where I think it could be heading, I think I just figured out the president of the United States is my cousin. So, trust me at this point, nothing is crazier either than you and me either being related or you being not guilty. That’s just the way may brain has been trained.”
Then the shouting starts. 
The video was taken after officers responded to The Battery at the tip of Charleston’s peninsula about 9:30 p.m. May 14 and found McLeod wearing just underwear and shoes and “yelling at the top of his lungs,” according to the police report, obtained by the Gazette. The video shows him obviously shirtless. During the ride, officers turn up the radio to a Taylor Swift song, seemingly to try to drown out his ranting. It ends with him reluctantly getting out of cruiser. Whether he’s wearing boxers or shorts is unclear. His shoes appear to be loafers or slippers.
“I’m not getting out of this car. I’m not doing it,” he says when they arrive at the jail. When the officer asks why he says “because it’s time to go to bed. I’ll sleep right here.”
During the ride, McLeod used partial or full names of a long list of South Carolina officials for what he deems “corrupt” behavior. At one point, he used a vulgarity to describe a Black man.
One of his repeated targets is state Attorney General Alan Wilson, who he references by his full name. The state’s top prosecutor was one of the first Republican candidates to enter the 2026 governor’s race.
“Allen f****** Wilson, I’m daring you right now,” McLeod shouts on the video before calling the attorney general out for not doing “the people’s work.”
McLeod then launches into a tirade against “Nancy” — presumably U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, another governor hopeful. He calls her a “b****” and says she’s using the playbook of Lee Atwater, a former Republican political operative notorious for using dirty campaign tactics.
“Tell the world right now, what you did in the halls of Congress was the greatest sin ever committed in the history of this nation,” McLeod continues.
He doesn’t say exactly what he’s talking about. But in February, Mace accused her ex-fiancé and three other men of recording incidents of sexual exploitation and assault involving multiple women without their knowledge during a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Neither Mace nor Wilson’s campaigns responded Wednesday to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
Other politicians McLeod mentions include Gov. Henry McMaster, former Gov. Nikki Haley and President Donald Trump.  McLeod calls Trump a “racist a**,” refers to Haley as a “b****” and appears to call on McMaster to sell the state plane.
He raves about Elon Musk and the Tesla billionaire’s space travel attempts: “I don’t ever want a billion dollars,” he said. “If I had a billion dollars, my stupid a** would try to do something like going to the moon.”
McLeod also rails against Republican donor Wallace Cheves and his efforts to build a casino near the small town of Santee, telling him repeatedly to pack his bags.
Sometimes he praises people. He seems to call former President Barack Obama a smooth talker and endorses former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer for the U.S. Senate. (Bauer suspended his challenge to U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham last week.)
And he refers to his “friend Bakari,” former Democratic state Rep. Bakari Sellers, who he worked alongside to negotiate an $88 million settlement for victims of the 2015 shooting at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. He describes Sellers as someone who can “kick (people) in the gums.”
“The only reason I didn’t let Bakari do the people’s work is because I like a little heavy lifting,” McLeod said.
Asked about the video Wednesday, Sellers said McLeod “needs to explain it” for the sake of the lawyer’s personal and professional relationships.
“I don’t know if there is an explanation,” Sellers told the Gazette. “But that’s on him.”
In a bond hearing following his arrest, McLeod’s lawyer told a judge the erratic behavior stemmed from a mental health episode and exhaustion, The Post and Courier reported.
In her statement, Spain said the party offers McLeod compassion and prays he finds the mental health support he needs.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-13-at-4.06.49 PM.png,,,2025-08-13 18:57:00.301414

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is failing to enforce water rights on behalf of the public to the detriment of rivers and healthy aquatic life including wild trout — and contrary to its constitutional duty — alleges a new lawsuit.
Last week, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Save the Bull Trout filed a complaint in Lewis and Clark County District Court asking a judge to find the state is failing in its duty to enforce its water rights.
The lawsuit asks the court to declare FWP is negligent in its duty to “maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment” as the state Constitution mandates by not asserting its water rights.
The complaint also asks the court to find FWP’s new protocol for stream flows under the Gov. Greg Gianforte administration is unscientific and is being used unlawfully.
It also alleges the protocol for determining water flow, created outside the rulemaking process, hinders the agency from exercising its constitutional duty to protect aquatic life.
FWP declined to comment on the lawsuit, and the Governor’s Office said FWP would speak for the administration.
“FWP is reviewing the complaint, but seeing as this is active litigation, we do not have a comment at this time,” said an FWP spokesperson.
However, Guy Alsentzer, executive director of the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said FWP doesn’t have a choice when it comes to protecting the public trust — it has a constitutional duty.
“Montana’s rivers are incredibly stressed — from extreme drought, unchecked pollution, and declining fish populations — yet the very agency tasked with protecting healthy fish and wildlife is choosing politics over science,” Alsentzer said in a statement. “At the moment when our rivers and streams need water the most, Fish, Wildlife and Parks has refused to act.”
Montana is experiencing “its most extreme drought on record,” and also its greatest demand, the lawsuit said. Citing the U.S. Drought Monitor, it said 82% of the state was experiencing drought conditions as of June.
Water rights possessed by FWP are “held in trust for the public, to protect aquatic life and recreation,” and they can help mitigate harms to fish, the lawsuit said.
However, the lawsuit alleges FWP has been leaving those rights unused, harming fisheries and the public as a result.
“While the state’s cold-water fisheries are the envy of the world, Montana’s iconic trout
species are almost universally experiencing population-level declines,” the lawsuit said.
It said the impacts could be costly; citing a scientific study, the lawsuit said cold-water sections of water generate $500,000 a year per kilometer, but cool-water sections generate just $60,000 by comparison, “primarily due to the preference for cold-water by nonresident fishers.”
In 2021, a conservation specialist at FWP was getting ready to call in water rights on the Smith River and the Shields River, as the agency has done in the past, the lawsuit said.
But that year, the Governor’s Office intervened, “wanting to know the names and types of water users that would be affected and asking for proof of how the call would provide benefit to the stream,” the complaint said.
For a variety of reasons, an FWP manager explained in a July 1, 2021, memo that FWP couldn’t definitively prove the benefit, given, for example, that some junior water rights users might not have been using water to begin with and would have nothing to add, the lawsuit said.
On July 7, 2021, Gov. Gianforte sent a letter to then-FWP Director Hank Worsech directing the agency to “forgo a call for water” on those rivers, the lawsuit said, quoting the correspondence.
Following public outcry in 2021, FWP issued a new Water Right Call Protocol in 2022, but the protocol is problematic in a number of ways, the complaint said.
The protocol fails to examine how aquatic life or recreational uses are protected, the lawsuit said, and it wasn’t created using the right procedures anyway, through rulemaking under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act.
In failing to assert its water rights, the complaint alleges FWP is harming the public’s ability to “fish, float, view and photograph scenery and wildlife, and engage in other vocational, scientific, spiritual and recreational activities which rely on healthy aquatic ecosystems.”
It also said the framers of the Montana Constitution meant it to be proactive in its environmental protections, as the Montana Supreme Court has concluded in other cases.
“Our constitution does not require that dead fish float on the surface of our state’s rivers and streams before its farsighted environmental protections can be invoked,” the lawsuit said, citing an earlier state Supreme Court opinion.
It also said the rights of the public and future generations under the Public Trust Doctrine predate the Montana Constitution, and the doctrine “imbues the state with a fiduciary duty to protect and conserve common pool natural resources, particularly water, for public benefit.”
Additionally, the lawsuit said Montana law “roundly recognizes” that the public’s property rights in water can be lost if they are not exercised and protected.
The complaint also points to findings of fact about the effects of climate change that were not challenged on appeal in Held vs. Montana. In the historic youth climate case, the Lewis and Clark County District Court found, and Montana Supreme Court affirmed, the state’s failure to consider greenhouse gas emissions violates the constitution’s protection of a clean and healthful environment.
“Anthropogenic climate change is disrupting the natural range of variation in the flow paths of Montana’s river systems,” the lawsuit said. “Compared to the 1960s, the summer streamflow … in Montana’s rivers has decreased by approximately 20% and stream temperatures have increased between 1-2 degrees C.”
The current complaint requests the court find Montanans’ constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment include healthy rivers with minimum stream flows that sustain aquatic life and fish; that FWP’s failure to assert its water rights violates its constitutional duty and breaches its obligation as a “trustee” of the public trust; and that FWP’s new protocol is unlawful and should be vacated.

Article Summary

U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, was the keynote speaker at the state’s largest annual downstate gathering of Democrats on Wednesday. Jeffries is poised to become U.S. House speaker if Democrats retake the chamber in 2026.
He said President Donald Trump is a threat to American democracy and that Democrats can win back Congress if they stand up for middle class values.
But that will be a challenge for the party, which has its lowest approval rating in history, according to recent polling.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on the story.

SPRINGFIELD – The man who hopes to be the next speaker of the U.S. House told an audience of Illinois Democrats Wednesday that President Donald Trump is a threat to American democracy and that Democrats can win back control of Congress if they stand up for middle class values.
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, the current House minority leader, was the keynote speaker at the annual breakfast of the Illinois County Chairs’ Association, Illinois Democrats’ largest annual event, which coincides with the party’s day at the Illinois State Fair.
“The first six months of the Trump administration have been a debacle,” Jeffries said after rattling off a list of controversial actions Trump has taken since resuming office in January, from canceling funding for medical research to mass firings of federal workers. “America is better than this. We’re better than this.”
Wednesday’s events served as an unofficial starting point of the 2026 campaign. In federal races, Democrats hope to gain enough seats to win control of the House, which would enable them to block most of Trump’s political agenda for the remainder of his term.
Democrats are currently the dominant party in Illinois, where they hold all state constitutional offices, supermajorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, both U.S. Senate seats and 14 of the state’s 17 seats in the U.S. House.

But they are currently in the opposite position at the federal level, where Republicans hold the White House and slim majorities in both chambers of Congress.
Those majorities, however, have been enough to push through legislation that enacts much of Trump’s domestic policy agenda, which includes deep cuts to federal spending on social programs such as Medicaid, Head Start and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, along with a package of large tax cuts that mainly benefit upper-income taxpayers.
“They’re stealing food from the mouths of children, veterans and seniors, and all of this is being done so they can enact massive tax breaks for their billionaire donors who don’t need it,” Jeffries said. “This is what House Republicans have done.”
To win control of the House, Democrats need a net gain of at least three seats in the 2026 elections. But making even small gains has become increasingly difficult in recent years as states have drawn congressional district maps in ways intended to heavily favor one part or the other.
Out of the 220 House seats currently held by Republicans, the Cook Political Report rates only eight as “toss ups” while nine are rated as leaning Republican. Meanwhile, 10 Democratic seats are rated as toss ups and 12 others are listed in the leaning category.
In addition, the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature, acting at Trump’s request, is currently attempting to redraw its maps in a way that would give the GOP an advantage in five more congressional seats. But Texas Democrats have so far thwarted that effort by fleeing the state to prevent the Texas House from mustering a quorum, an action that Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has actively supported.
Unfavorable ratings
Democrats also face another obstacle to reclaiming a majority in the House – the party’s own unfavorable rating among American voters.
A Gallup poll in July showed that while Democrats hold a slight lead over Republicans in party affiliation, their favorability rating had fallen to 34%, its lowest point in more than 30 years. And exit polls from the 2024 election showed Trump winning a slight majority among lower-income voters while pulling in support from 45% of those in union households – demographic groups that have traditionally made up a big part of the Democratic Party’s base.
Asked about the party’s unfavorable rating at a separate event in Springfield Tuesday, Jeffries said Trump’s own approval rating has been falling as well.
“Donald Trump is more unpopular at this period of time than any president in American history, and he started out on January 20 more popular than he had ever been in his 10 years on the public scene,” he said. “The one big, ugly bill, which is now law, is deeply unpopular.”
But speaking to the Democratic County Chairs’ Association Wednesday, Jeffries sounded a message that was clearly aimed at winning back working-class voters.
“As Democrats, we believe in rewarding hard work, that when you work hard and play by the rules, you should be able to live a comfortable life,” he said. “Can I break that down for you? Good paying job, good housing, good health care, a good education for your children and a good retirement.”
Republicans will have an opportunity to respond to those criticisms and put forth their own election message Thursday when they celebrate Republican Day at the fair.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On Friday, Secretary Jared Hoy and the warden of GBCI, Christopher Stevens, denied violating any of Laureano’s rights and engaging in any unlawful actions.
They denied that the plaintiff, Phyllis Laureano, “is entitled to any of the relief that she seeks” and called for the complaint to be dismissed. 
The lawsuit alleged that “defendants’ willful and deliberate indifference to Mr. Laureano’s safety resulted in him being murdered by his cellmate.” It alleged that “based on Defendants’ actions, Mr. Laureano suffered cruel and unusual punishment when Defendants failed to protect him from harm.”
The lawsuit alleged that “defendants failed to protect Mr. Laureano when they placed a particularly aggressive, violent, and discriminatory inmate with a history of severe physical assault and mental health issues” in a cell with him. 
In June, Jackson Vogel was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for Laureano’s death.
Vogel reportedly said he attacked Laureano because he was Black and gay, according to a report the Examiner received from the Brown County Sheriff’s Office. 
According to the report, Vogel had been issued conduct reports dated March 5 and 6, 2024, for language in inmate complaints and interview requests. 
The complaints reportedly contained “obscene, profane, abusive and threatening language” and swastika symbols. According to the report, Vogel wrote “‘you all need and deserve Death! Hail Hitler!’” and mentioned the Aryan Brotherhood and “‘White Power (WLM).’” 
The Post-Crescent reported that in May 2024, a judge and a prosecutor in Manitowoc County received death threats in the mail from Vogel, containing violent language detailing torture and cannibalism. 
In an article about Laureano’s death at GBCI in August, the Examiner reported that court records showed Vogel had been found guilty of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, and Laureano had been found guilty of taking and driving a vehicle without consent and as party to a crime for substantial battery intending bodily harm, robbery with use of force and first-degree recklessly endangering safety. 
A telephone scheduling conference will take place at 9:20 a.m. on Sept. 11.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The future of University of Central Oklahoma’s student newspaper, The Vista, is unclear following a decision to immediately end the print publication. 
The Vista was established in 1903 and is distributed on the Edmond campus for free. This fall will mark the first semester the publication won’t print in 122 years, said Joe Hight, interim chair of the Student Media Advisory Board and UCO’s journalism ethics chair. 
Printing newspapers is still a viable learning tool for journalism students, he said. The Vista will continue to publish stories online, but Hight said there’s no strategy in place for the publication to immediately go all digital. 
“I use digital products myself all the time, but there still is value in using the print product as a learning tool,” Hight said. “That it’s a part of history. That once you put something down in print, it’s there to be referred back many decades from now. It can’t be changed or altered or anything like that.”
With a need to cut the student media budget by $18,000, the Student Media Advisory Board recommended reducing The Vista’s print publication to twice a month and using funds from the Dennie Hall Endowment Fund to supplement additional publications, Hight said. Those funding the endowment specified the money be used for The Vista, including print operations, he said. 
The board’s decision followed lots of research and hearing from students, including staff members of The Vista, Hight said.
Despite the recommendation, Hight said Elizabeth Maier, dean of UCO’s liberal arts college, made the call to cease printing The Vista immediately. Maier cited a “mandate” from the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and the Regional University System of Oklahoma to be more efficient with resources, he said. 
Maier did not immediately return requests for comment. It was not clear which directive she was referring to. 
The Vista will “transition to an online digital publication” this fall semester, which begins Monday, said Adrienne Nobles, a spokesperson for UCO, in a statement Wednesday.

Nobles said The Vista previously had an online digital edition, in addition to print.
“This move maximizes university resources and aligns with industry trends and expectations,” she said. “UCO will continue meeting students where they are, offering a relevant, high-quality educational experience focused on career readiness.”
Hight said The Vista’s stories are currently published online under UCentral’s domain, UCO’s student media network. But without its own website, he said there’s concern The Vista name will be lost with all branding instead tied to UCentral. 
The Student Media Advisory Board is scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon on UCO’s Edmond campus. At the meeting, Hight said he will read a statement from the dean, emails from concerned students and faculty, and discuss the future of The Vista’s operations and the elimination of the publication’s campus news racks that were removed this summer. 
In recent years, other student media publications have also ceased print editions but continued digital publications. 
University of Oklahoma’s student run OU Daily stopped printing its weekly newspaper in 2022. 
At Texas A&M, the student newspaper The Battalion ended its print operation in 2022. The Maneater, University of Missouri’s student newspaper, stopped printing in 2023. 
Oklahoma State University’s The O’Colly continues to print once a week and publishes online. 
Mark Thomas, Oklahoma Press Association executive vice president, said printing is a small expense compared to a university’s total expenditures. 
The estimated cost to print The Vista for a year is around $12,000, according to an editorial in the publication. 
“If they say it’s the money, let’s open the expenditures of the entire university and let’s look at how they’re spending the money,” Thomas said. 
But if the decision were instead based on the viewpoints published in student media, it would be difficult for the university to overcome, he said. 
Pressure on student journalists to be a “mouthpiece for the administration” doesn’t silence them, Thomas said, because students will still find a way to be heard. 
No one contests that digital publications are an important tool and skill, especially for breaking news, he said. 
“But there are certain things that you want to have archived and to live on for a long time,” Thomas said. “And so that kind of a unilateral mandate to come down and say, ‘We’re just not going to print anything anymore,’ says that they really don’t want to have an archive that can’t be changed.”

Evers vetoed a bill that would have deprived Wisconsinites who finished serving their time for felonies of voting rights if they hadn't paid all their court fees and other obligations.. Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Gov. Tony Evers recently vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill, AB87/SB95, that would have suspended the right to vote for Wisconsinites convicted of a felony who have served their sentence until they fulfill outstanding court-order obligations, such as fines, costs, restitution or community service.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
In Wisconsin, people who have served their criminal sentence for a felony, including incarceration and community service, parole, probation and extended supervision, are eligible to vote.
But the proposed legislation would have required any outstanding requirements – “fines, costs, fees, surcharges, and restitution [and] any court-ordered community service, imposed in connection with the crime” – to be addressed in full before voting rights were fully restored.
State Rep. Shae Sortwell, (R-Two Rivers) a sponsor of the bill, offered support in writing at the March 4, 2025 Assembly public hearing, saying the bill would “ensure justice is entirely served and full accountability is given to those that still owe a debt to their victims, especially those that are trafficked.” (The legislation also required restitution for victims of human trafficking as a condition.)
State Sen. Dan Feyen, (R- Fond Du Lac), a co-sponsor of the bill, said he supported the legislation “to make sure crime victims are justly compensated and the perpetrators of these crimes are held accountable for their action.”
However, in vetoing the proposed legislation, Evers said, “This bill would create additional barriers to make it harder for individuals who have completed their sentences to have their right to vote restored. My promise to Wisconsinites has always been that I will not sign legislation that makes it harder for eligible Wisconsinites to cast their ballot. I will continue to keep that promise.”
Mark Rice, Wisconsin transformational justice campaign coordinator at WISDOM, a faith-based organization that works to advance the rights of immigrants and formerly incarcerated people, said the issue is personal to him because he had his voting rights removed when he was sentenced for a felony.
“I couldn’t vote for several years after serving my prison sentence,” he said.
For those coming out of prison, said Rice, it is often difficult to secure employment and have the funds to pay off outstanding fees and restitution, and he doesn’t believe those struggling to integrate into society should face yet another obstacle to participate in civic life.
“We here at WISDOM have been organizing to expand voting rights for formerly incarcerated people for many years, and we thank Gov. Evers for vetoing a bill that would have amounted to voter suppression,” said Rice.
Marianne Oleson, operations director for Ex-incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) of Wisconsin, also celebrated Evers’ veto.
“Governor Evers’ veto is a tremendous victory for EXPO, for the people we serve, and for democracy in Wisconsin,” Oleson said in a statement. “This bill would have imposed a modern-day poll tax, silencing thousands of Wisconsinites who have already completed their sentences simply because they could not afford to pay court costs or restitution.”
She added, “At EXPO, we believe the right to vote should never depend on the size of your bank account. Justice means restoring full citizenship and dignity to those who have paid their debt to society — not creating new barriers that keep them from participating in our democracy.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin has opposed the legislation since the March 4, 2025 public hearing.
“This proposal would create a modern-day poll tax in Wisconsin,” said the ACLU, and compared  the proposed legislation to a controversial Florida bill, SB 7066, that passed in 2019, which required “outstanding legal obligations” to be met before even allowing ex-felons the ability to register to vote.
The ACLU also warned that the state does not have a “centralized database” to accurately identify all outstanding obligations that would have to be met before voting is regained.
“This would make it nearly impossible for some individuals to determine what they owe, if anything, and whether they would be eligible to vote,” an  ACLU spokesperson said..
Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause of Wisconsin, an organization supporting open and responsive government, also supported Evers’ veto.
“This measure had as its goal to make it more difficult for long marginalized communities in Wisconsin who are disproportionately Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, as well as people living in poverty and those with disabilities, to be able to exercise their right to vote,” Heck said in a statement.
He added, “This legislation didn’t make whole people who have survived crime; it just would have weakened democracy and put the right to vote out of reach through a poll tax – an outrageous and deeply unfair price tag on the freedom to vote.”

Article Summary

JB Pritzker and Illinois Democrats say they’ve delivered for middle class residents and that’s the blueprint their party should follow in 2026.
Democratic candidates for Illinois Senate disagree whether it’s right to receive contributions from corporations as they seek to set themselves apart in the primary race.
Some Democrats say there should be a path to independently drawn congressional maps while the Illinois House speaker says he’s not looking at making any changes to Illinois’ maps in response to Texas.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – Democrats across the country are searching for a winning message in the 2026 elections, but Illinois Democrats say they’re already found one.
With a video montage showcasing the state’s Democratic elected officials as Star Wars heroes fighting President Donald Trump – portrayed as Darth Vader – party leaders unofficially kicked off the 2026 campaign. That was part of an annual Democratic County Chairs’ Association breakfast in Springfield attended by more than 2,000 people before Gov. JB Pritzker held the governor’s traditional campaign rally at the Illinois State Fair.
“Illinois Democrats shook off the rust of old, poll-tested ideas and you governed instead with a renewed dedications to the needs and the wants of working families,” Pritzker told the room full of county-level Democrats.
The governor brought the stump speech he’s used on the national campaign trail and told the gathering of Illinois Democrats to stop analyzing why Republicans and Trump were victorious in 2024. Pritzker argued Illinois Democrats have already successfully implemented a message that resonates with voters.
“Ours is a story that doesn’t have a cult telling us what to believe,” Pritzker said.
While Illinois Democrats have been undefeated in statewide elections since 2018 when Pritzker and a slate of Democrats coasted to power amid Trump’s unpopularity in that year’s midterm election, the party has struggled at the national level. A Wall Street Journal poll in July found only 33% of voters across the country have a favorable view of the Democratic Party – the lowest in 35 years.
Pritzker, who has traveled the country and logged numerous appearances on national TV shows this year imploring his party to talk more about economic issues, isn’t concerned about failing to resonate with voters in Illinois.
“We’re not struggling to come up with a unified message, folks. Democrats are for working families,” he told reporters.
Pritzker is seeking a rare third term as he mulls running for president in 2028. Democratic Party of Illinois Chair Lisa Hernandez said the governor has created the right road map for her party in 2026.
“He’s been certainly a person that has moved this state in the direction where people do feel that there’s somebody speaking on their behalf,” Hernandez told Capitol News Illinois.
Senate race
While Pritzker seeks a third term, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin is not running for reelection, opening up his seat for the first time in 30 years. The three most high-profile candidates vying to replace him appeared at the State Fair Wednesday to explain why they deserve to replace the second-highest-ranking Democrat in the U.S. Senate.
“I wouldn’t even begin to pretend like I could somehow replace him, but I aspire to build on his legacy of great progress,” U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi told reporters.
U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly said she’s focused on being herself and hopes voters will look at her record representing a district that stretches from Chicago’s South Side to rural central Illinois.
Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton touted her current experience as a statewide elected official.
“When I’m going around the state, what people are saying is they are ready for new voices, new blood, new energy in Washington, D.C. – new ideas – and that the status quo right now simply is not working,” Stratton told reporters.
While the three candidates agree on many issues, Stratton has injected contention into the race by pledging not to take money from corporate political action committees.
“I want to make sure that I’m centering the voices of Illinois families and not corporate special interests,” Stratton said.

Stratton raised $1 million in the first quarter of her campaign as of the end of June, but the balance is dwarfed by the $22 million in Krishnamoorthi’s campaign fund and $2 million in Kelly’s. Both Kelly and Krishnamoorthi have received contributions from corporations.
“She’s also hoping for a super PAC to come to her rescue and so it’s very rich for her to accuse others of somehow being beholden to other interests,” Krishnamoorthi said of Stratton.

Stratton launched a federal political action committee of her own in January, which raised just short of $400,000 in the first six months of the year, according to federal records. Pritzker has endorsed his lieutenant governor and has a political action committee that could allow him to financially support Stratton’s campaign further.
Kelly is also working to compete with Krishnamoorthi’s fundraising power.
“I would not have gotten into this race if I didn’t think I had the resources I needed to win,” Kelly said. “I’m giving up a seat I probably could’ve held a long time.”
Redistricting hopes
Pritzker has positioned himself at the center of a national fight over mid-decade redistricting in Texas and has said all options are on the table for Illinois to respond. Recently, however, he has downplayed the likelihood of Illinois lawmakers further gerrymandering a congressional map where 14 of 17 districts already favor Democrats.
Hernandez, who in her capacity as a state lawmaker led the 2021 remap process for Illinois House Democrats, said the process she followed in 2021 was the “right way.”
Asked if she would support a national independent redistricting commission like Pritzker has said he favors, Hernandez said “we can continue talking about that, but for right now, I’m content how we handled things.”
Kelly said she would normally be wary of political blowback for Democrats if they tried to counter Texas Republicans, who hope to add five more Republican-leaning congressional seats in their state.
“We have to fight fire with fire,” Kelly said. “We have to take the House back. There are despicable things and we cannot continue that.”
Krishnamoorthi said he favors banning mid-decade redistricting.
“My vision is someday hopefully we’ll have fair maps across the board, across all states, so that everybody will be in parity,” he said.
House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Hillside, told reporters there hasn’t been any discussion about redrawing the lines in Illinois.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A compound called 7-hydroxymitragynine, also known as 7-OH, found in some kratom products, is now a Schedule 1 controlled substance in Florida.
Florida Attorney General James Uthemeir issued an emergency rule Wednesday that places 7-OH on a list of drugs, substances, or chemicals that are considered to have no accepted medical use but a high potential for abuse. Schedule 1 substances cannot be legally obtained with a prescription or readily dispensed for clinical use in the United States.
Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary joined a press conference along with Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, Dean of the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine Dean Dr. Charles Lockwood, and USF Health emergency department physician Cory Howard.
“So it is a significant pain killer. It has been proven to be highly addictive and easily can be overdosed, so its very dangerous,” Uthmeier said.
Simpson said his agency, which exercises regulatory oversight of kratom sales, would begin enforcement efforts Thursday and that retailers needed to remove the products from their shelves.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Florida legislators already have made it illegal to sell kratom to customers under the age of 21.  Nevertheless, Uthmeier said it’s being marketed and targeted to “kids.”
Meanwhile, the FDA’s Makary lauded the AG for taking quick action following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decision last month to  send warning letters  to seven companies for allegedly illegally marketing products containing 7-OH.
Although 7-OH occurs naturally in trace amounts in kratom, the FDA’s  letters focus on concentrated products such as tablets, gummies, drink mixes, and shots that may be dangerous.
USF’s Howard said he has seen four patients over the last two weeks, some in the emergency room, who took 7-OH.
“I’m seeing this firsthand pop up,” Howard said.
“Most consumers don’t even realize the danger of the product, right? They can easily access it on store shelves, gas stations, right? I’ve seen this pop up in tablets, gummies, you know, candy lookalikes, drink mixes, teas, shots, wellness supplements. I personally have seen this show up a the gym, at my local gym, being passed around as a wellness supplement or to get over arthritis or, you know, kind of help that fatigue after a strong workout.”
Not universally supported
The rule isn’t supported by everyone, though.
South Florida attorney Paula Chavenko noted that the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust (HART), formed in 2023, has been working with researchers, regulators, and public health stakeholders to investigate the safety profile and efficacy of 7-OH, including through evaluation of how it is used across different consumer populations, potential adverse health effects, additional toxicological and safety data, and abuse potential studies.
“Studies from HART have observed a notable 30% reduction in opioid overdoses, suggesting a possible role for conservative, controlled use of the plant in supporting recovery,” Chavenko said.
“We stand for a regulatory framework that safeguards public health, encourages responsible usage, and supports scientific inquiry — all without resorting to scheduling that could hamper both medical advancement and individual liberty,” she continued.
The substance, she said, “should remain accessible when manufactured, sold transparently and safely, but not banned in a way that harms research, takes away the ability for the American people to have access to this botanical alternative, and creates counterproductive outcomes,” she said.

(Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)A federal judge Wednesday declined to block Alabama’s 2024 state law banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and so-called “divisive concepts.”
U.S. District Judge David Proctor wrote in a 146-page opinion that professors and students in the University of Alabama System who filed a lawsuit challenging SB 129 did not meet any of the requirements needed to issue a preliminary injunction, saying that “a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy” that is “never awarded as of right.”
“The court concludes that plaintiffs have not established the requirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction against the Board’s enforcement of SB 129,” Proctor wrote.

Proctor issued a separate order dismissing Gov. Kay Ivey as a defendant in the lawsuit and wrote in the opinion that none of the “injuries alleged” in the lawsuit or in the hearing “stem from actions taken by the Governor in her official capacity.”
“There is simply nothing in SB 129, the allegations of the complaint, or the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing that implicates Governor Ivey in any action taken in relation to SB 129 (other than her signing it after the Alabama Legislature passed it and her comments while doing so). These allegations are insufficient to establish that Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are in any way traceable to Governor Ivey,” Proctor wrote.
The lawsuit, brought by professors and students in the University of Alabama system against Gov. Kay Ivey and the university system Board of Trustees, alleged that the law stifled instructional activity and violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The anti-DEI law banned public funding for diversity and inclusion initiatives and the teaching of so-called “divisive concepts,” such as people of one race being “inherently responsible” for past crimes committed by members of that race.
Messages seeking comments were left with the Alabama Attorney General’s office, which represented Ivey, and Jay Ezelle, who represents the UA Board of Trustees.
Antonio Ingram, a NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the case, said in an interview Wednesday afternoon that while a stay was denied and Ivey was dismissed from the case, the lawsuit will move forward with the UA Board of Trustees as the sole defendants.
“While this is a setback, we are still committed to fighting this discriminatory law that is, in our opinion, violating the First Amendment rights of students and professors,” Ingram said.
In briefs filed after hearings in late June and early July, plaintiffs argued that a new law is leading to “viewpoint discrimination,” claiming that professors, fearing enforcement, have to “self-censor” and change their teaching methods. One professor, Dana Patton, testified she was investigated after an anonymous complaint and warned by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, that lawmakers wouldn’t “let this go.”
The Alabama Attorney General’s office, representing Gov. Kay Ivey, argued in their post-hearing brief that these fears aren’t “objectively reasonable” since the professors stated they don’t intend to violate the law. Attorneys for the UA Board, argued that classroom speech is “government speech,” not private speech, and that the University of Alabama has the right to “reasonably control the content of their curriculum.”
In July 2024, ahead of the anti-DEI law’s implementation, the UA system announced it planned to close the schools’ DEI offices and replace them with offices that seemingly addressed similar goals. Later in August, UA closed its Black Student Union and Safe Zone, its LGBTQ+ resource center, citing compliance with SB 129.
Student plaintiffs also claimed the law caused their organizations to lose funding and campus spaces. The defendants countered that some of these injuries are “monetary” and that, in certain cases, students chose not to apply for available funding.

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) The federal government’s most recent assessment of health-facility inspections indicates Iowa has failed to meet three key standards.
The new report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services indicates the state-run inspection agencies that oversee nursing homes and hospitals around the nation fielded more than 107,000 complaints about health care facilities last year – a 31% increase from 2019 that officials say may have contributed to 38 states failing to meet all of the federal performance standards.
Each year, CMS assesses the performance of the state agencies tasked with enforcing federal regulations concerning health care facilities. The latest data shows that last year, only 14 of the 52 agencies met all of the acceptable thresholds for the annual recertification of nursing homes, according to the CMS State Performance Standards System Findings published last week.

CMS’ report indicates the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing met most of the federal standards related to the inspection process in 2024, but failed to meet the standards in three areas:
— Off-hour inspections at the worst nursing homes: Under CMS guidelines, state agencies are to inspect the worst care facilities in their jurisdiction — the federally designated “special-focus facilities” that have recurring, serious deficiencies in resident care — during off hours to guard against homes altering their routine in anticipation of what should be a surprise visit by inspectors.
— Immediate jeopardy in acute-care settings: To accurately record the seriousness of deficiencies that can cause actual injury or death to residents in acute and continuing-care settings, inspectors must use a CMS-prescribed “immediate jeopardy template” in at least 80% of all cases where immediate jeopardy is cited. The template is used to document the evidence of each issue that places patients at risk.
— Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act violations in acute-care settings: State inspection agencies must initiate, on a timely basis, the intake and investigation of at least 95% of EMTALA immediate-jeopardy complaints tied to acute and continuing-care providers. EMTALA violations often relate to emergency-room patients being discharged without first being stabilized.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch asked the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing on Tuesday for its perspective on the CMS report. As of Wednesday afternoon, the agency had not commented on the report.
Complaints up 31% from 2019 
In its report, CMS notes that its findings are to be considered “in the context of unchanged state-agency funding levels since fiscal year 2015, despite continued resource and workload challenges in the last five years.”
The report points out that since 2019, the number of complaints requiring investigation by health facility inspectors has increased 31% nationally. Most of the 107,000 complaints filed in fiscal year 20124 are related to nursing homes, CMS reported.
CMS also reported that during the past five years, there has been a 79% increase in complaints directed against hospitals, with more than 14,500 such complaints filed in fiscal year 2024.
Last October, DIAL issued a press release announcing that its health facilities inspectors had “met the federal mandate for nursing home inspections outlined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for federal fiscal year 2024.”
The news release focused on the federal requirement that each individual nursing home undergo an annual inspection, called a “recertification survey,” within 16 months of its last annual inspection. DIAL met that specific requirement in 2024.
At the time, DIAL also took issue with a September 2024 report from Auditor of State Rob Sand that indicated DIAL had failed to meet certain inspection standards. DIAL said the audit “relied on outdated numbers and incorrect federal performance measurements,” and the agency criticized the auditor’s office for failing to engage with DIAL “before issuing its inaccurate report.”
“The auditor’s report is inaccurate, incomplete, and confusing,” agency spokesperson Diane McCool said at the time. “It is also a waste of taxpayer dollars as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will release their own findings of the state survey agencies after the federal fiscal year concludes.”
At least part of the conflict over the findings is due to the nature of the auditor’s report, which looked at DIAL’s compliance over three annual inspection cycles. DIAL itself focused more narrowly on data from 2024 when it performed better than in previous years.
The auditor’s report indicated Iowa had been conducting nursing home inspections, on average, every 17.1 months — which is more than four months beyond the federal mandate that requires such homes to be inspected, on average, every 12.9 months.
In addition to the federal mandate for inspecting all homes on a 12.9-month average, CMS also requires states to inspect each individual care facility at least once every 15.9 months.
According to the state auditor’s report, DIAL had failed to meet that requirement, as well. The report stated that for 85.4% of Iowa’s 403 nursing homes, inspectors missed the 15.9-month deadline on at least one occasion during the past three inspection cycles.

Residents opposed to a Malletts Bay hotel project have hired a lawyer who sent a letter to town officials last month reiterating a litany of concerns.

COLCHESTER — On a warm Thursday evening, a group of residents gathered at Bayside Park with signs they used to protest a hotel and resort proposal at a recent Development Review Board meeting.
They pointed out a long marina in the bay and two parcels of private property at 166 and 180 West Lakeshore Drive that were largely hidden by a cluster of large trees.
They imagined what the area would look like when the majority of those old trees are removed. That’s part of the plan proposed by Hazelett Strip-Casting Corporation, which is seeking to combine the two lots and to construct five large buildings into the slope overlooking the bay. 
The plan envisions a $8 million hotel comprising five “cottage-style” buildings for “a 20-room inn” with a restaurant and event space at the lakefront site of a former motel.
“The town should protect us and the bay,” said Phyllis Bryden, who bought a house on East Lakeshore Drive nine years ago and has been disappointed with overcrowding of the area, the diminished water quality and increased traffic on the scenic stretch of Malletts Bay.
Marilyn Sowles, a resident of Porters Point Road and a former selectboard member, is concerned about diminished views — both from the lake and the road. 
She held up a photo of what the shoreline now looks like as taken from a boat on the bay. It looks like a verdant stretch of green on the sloping shore. The project renderings replace it with five shiny glassfront buildings as proposed by consultants Scott Homsted from the engineering firm Krebs and Lansing, and Benjamin Avery of Greenfield Growth Consulting LLC, formerly a developer with Black Rock.

“There is no way to build that huge monstrosity on this skinny piece of land and maintain the views from the lake,” she said at a packed Development Review Board hearing on July 23 that ran almost four hours, like the previous June 11 hearing.
Residents, including those gathered last week, continue to protest the $8 million project. At both hearings, they reiterated concerns about environmental and traffic impacts, and with setting a development precedent for the Malletts Bay shorefront.
Between the two hearings about 20 concerned residents hired Brice Simon, a lawyer in Stowe, who sent a letter to town officials July 21 reiterating a litany of concerns. These range from the project’s lack of stormwater and runoff treatment to its adverse scenic impacts.
“I hope that the DRB will deny the application,” said Simon, who outlined how and why the proposal does not meet the definition of an inn, as the developers call it. He said it is a hotel, which is not allowed in the area according to the Colchester Town Plan.
“The site plan approval is not appropriate for a project that is so out of conformance with the surrounding area, and which would cause such undue adverse effects on the surrounding ecological, scenic, state and municipal resources,” he wrote in an email.
Simon also submitted a petition at the last development review board meeting signed by more than 50 residents opposed to the project.
Town officials declined to comment.
The board is expected to issue a written decision on the project in September, 45 days from the last hearing, according to Zachary Maia, development manager in the town’s planning and zoning office. He confirmed Simon’s letter was received as testimony by the Development Review Board.

Many of the residents who gathered at the waterfront last week shared views on why they believe the project is out-of-character in the bay.
Longtime resident Jerry Allyn said he is concerned about added water pollution it could bring. A big project without a stormwater runoff plan is irresponsible, he said. And with most of the 98 parking spots proposed across the street, drop-off and crossings would create a major traffic hazard, he added.
“When I first came here there was one traffic light in town. Now West Lakeshore Drive is one of the busiest sections in town,” he said referring to the traffic. It has been exacerbated since the Malletts Bay sewer project began.
Nancy Cloutier of Church Road, who has been living in Colchester for 22 years, said she and her husband are “appalled” the town would consider such a large project that would “destroy the view,” affect traffic and does not meet the Town Plan’s guidelines.

“The aesthetics are horrible,” she said.
Cloutier said she has a background in event planning and takes issue with the proposed capacity numbers presented by the developer. What is projected to be a 40-person capacity restaurant can hold much more, she said, if tables and chairs are removed for an event. She shared her concern at the last hearing.
“I feel that the board and the planning and zoning commission have been given enough testimony and information from citizens to reject this permit out-of-pocket on very good, solid ground,” said resident Jeanne Welch, who commutes daily and is concerned about the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and that the development could circumvent local regulations.
The developers and consultants did not respond to comment.
Meanwhile, all await the town board’s decision.
As the rays of the setting sun dappled through the trees at Bayside Park, the residents lowered their signs and walked slowly up the hill to head home.

James Comer said that while he supports President Donald Trump’s crime-fighting moves in Washington, D.C., he hopes similar efforts will not be replicated in Kentucky. 
Trump mobilized National Guard troops and asserted control of police in the nation’s capital on Monday under what he declared a “crime emergency.” He also warned he may pursue similar action in other Democratic-led cities. 
Comer, Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District representative, said Wednesday afternoon that the president’s federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force shows “that the president, as well as Congress, is serious about cracking down on the crime crisis.” The congressman spoke to reporters with Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman following a roundtable with law enforcement officials from across the state.
Comer, who is the House Oversight chair, said the committee will have a hearing with Washington, D.C., officials in September. 
“We’re going to be talking about how we can solve this problem. We don’t want Washington D.C. to have a National Guard presence very long. But what we see in Washington D.C., I’ve learned today, we’re seeing in places like Louisville and other places,” Comer said. 
Comer said his discussion with Kentucky police suggests there has been “a huge increase in juvenile criminal activity.” He later added that he would share the information gleaned in Wednesday’s roundtable with Trump. 
Comer said that in general juvenile offenders “aren’t being prosecuted for crimes for various reasons,” leading to an increase in adult criminals encouraging young people to commit crimes. 
In January, violent crime in Washington, D.C., hit a 30 year low. 
“We have this crime crisis that’s overwhelmingly in the larger cities in the United States, but at the core of this is ensuring that we back these guys on the front line here,” Comer said, referring to the law enforcement officials present. Part of that includes ensuring adequate funding for police, he added. 
When asked if Trump should replicate his move in D.C. in Kentucky, Comer said “hopefully not” and said that Louisville is “a different deal.”
“I think we’ve got a great (Louisville) Metro Council, and I think we’ve got a mayor (Craig Greenberg) that’s serious about cracking down on crime,” Comer said. “Many times it’s the attitude of the prosecutors and the judges. People have to be held accountable for crimes that are being committed in Washington, D.C.”
Comer’s committee has legislative jurisdiction over the District of Columbia ., so he said he often works closely with local officials there. He said “a liberal metro D.C. Council” and “prosecutors and judges that are just so lenient” have led to criminal justice reform “so far to the extreme that the criminals — they’re never held accountable in Washington, D.C.” 
“I don’t want to see what’s happening in Washington replicated to other cities, but if these other cities don’t get serious about it, then it probably will be, and the president’s said that,” Comer said. 
Coleman called Comer “one of the most influential Kentuckians who walked the halls in Washington, D.C.” while introducing him. Coleman also said that Comer has the ear of Trump and leads the House Oversight Committee “both very significant positions to help us address the problems that were talked about around this table.”

Earlier this month, some Kentucky Republicans called on Comer to consider running for governor in 2027. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, serving his second term, will be term-limited. 
Beshear, who is seen as a possible presidential candidate in 2028, addressed Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Washington during his weekly press conference Wednesday afternoon. 
“The Guard is not trained for everyday law enforcement activity. The Guard is trained for logistical support, responding to natural disasters, assisting and helping active military,” Beshear said. “To put our Guard — who, remember, are our neighbors — in places and spaces that they are not trained for, puts an American with a family in a potentially dangerous situation.” 
When Trump mobilized California National Guard troops in response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ activity in Los Angeles earlier this summer, Beshear said at the time that “violence is never acceptable” but “a chain of command” should be respected. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had objected to Trump’s action. 
“My hope is that going forward, this will not be a tactic that the president continues to use because the very people he is calling in to do different jobs may be put in harm’s way,” Beshear said Wednesday.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4842-e1755121491632-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

KILLINGTON — The Killington Resort is accustomed to hosting fast-flying World Cup racers on its aptly named Superstar trail. But that didn’t stop locals from gawking Wednesday when a helicopter circled higher than the mid-August temperature as part of an even more stratospheric event.
Vermont’s largest ski area used the chopper to install a dozen towers — some up to 58 feet tall — for a new $12 million Superstar chairlift. It’s part of a $38 million improvement project that also will raise the capacity and reduce the energy consumption of the resort’s 9-million-gallon-a-day snowmaking system.
“This is really a milestone moment,” Tait Germon, Killington’s director of mountain operations, shouted over the windy whir of propellers. “It’s exciting to see it start to come together.”
When a 20-something honeymooner named Preston Smith opened the first trails on the state’s second tallest peak in 1958, he was happy to raise $30,000 for a simple shelter and parking lot.
Smith, now 95, went on to create the biggest snow-sport resort in eastern North America before its sale to the Maine-based American Skiing Company in 1996 (the same year neighboring Pico Mountain joined the portfolio), the Utah-based Powdr Corp. in 2007 and local investors who formed the Killington Independence Group last year.
“This landmark purchase represents a commitment to keeping Killington and Pico in the hands of those who know and love it, with plans to increase capital investment while preserving the mountains’ unique character and community,” the current owners said in a statement last August.

The Rutland County resort closed the four-decade-old Superstar chairlift in April for dismantling, leaving its nearby K-1 gondola to transport summer visitors to hiking and biking trails and an 18-hole golf course. 
Killington faced challenges finding a helicopter, as its original pilot left to fight Canadian wildfires. But another crew arrived Wednesday to fly the towers onto recently poured concrete foundations, logging in some 50 trips up and down the 4,241-foot peak from early morning to late afternoon.
“Given the challenging terrain we’re working with — it’s not like you can drive in with a crane — this is the most efficient way to do this,” Germon said.
The new six-passenger chairlift is on schedule for completion in November, Killington officials said. But mindful of potential weather problems, they couldn’t guarantee it would be finished in time for the World Cup, which has drawn up to 20,000 spectators and a national television audience of 2 million viewers annually since 2016.
As a result, the international circuit will move this year to Copper Mountain in Colorado, although “the race is expected to return to Killington Thanksgiving weekend 2026,” the Vermont resort said in a statement.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) 


“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” Mark Twain’s quip perfectly describes the entire Trump Administration, but none more so than medical crackpot, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
Perched with his brain worm on top of Health and Human Services, Kennedy probably affects your health more than your family doctor. But unlike your doctor, Kennedy has no medical degree, no hospital privileges, never cared for a patient, never discovered a drug, never published a research paper, and wouldn’t know which end of a stethoscope to use if his life or yours depended on it. Nonetheless he has opinions, and he’s enforcing them on you, on all of us. This makes as much sense as pilots flying airplanes who have never seen a cockpit, or placing the future of the United States in the hands of Donald “Windmills Cause Cancer” Trump.
Many actual medical experts believe vaccines have done more good for humanity than any other public health advance in history.  COVID vaccines saved nearly 20 million lives globally in their first year alone. They also reduced the risk of severe, debilitating outcomes and long COVID after infection.  But Kennedy knows “for sure” that decades of knowledge accumulated by the entire world’s medical community is wrong, and he’s eager to straighten us out.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine have been under development for 30 years. Compared to older technologies they are cheaper, can be mass produced faster, and can be changed more quickly to address inevitable virus mutations like with COVID. This technology also has great promise to treat cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and diabetes.  Two American scientists won the Nobel Prize for their mRNA discoveries.  To real scientists, mRNA vaccines are not controversial.  Without them COVID would probably still be spreading death and disability across the globe.
In May Kennedy yanked $590 million from developing pandemic flu vaccines such as bird flu.  Rick Bright, who led Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority during Trump 1.0, said,“Disinvesting from mRNA strips us of one of the fastest tools we have to contain the next pandemic.”
But the greatest potential of new mRNA vaccines may be as a monumental breakthrough in cancer treatments. The DNA of cancer cells is as variable as the people who are hosts for the disease. Moreover, cancer cells create unique pieces of protein that are not found in healthy cells. A vaccine that produces those pieces can train the immune system to attack those cells. This technology could offer personalized treatment by training a patient’s immune system to read and then destroy individually unique cancer cells.  The vaccines furthest along could treat pancreatic and brain cancers. Over 120 clinical trials on cancer vaccines were underway as of early this year.
But then Kennedy announced last week he will yank another $500 million from vaccines with mRNA technology.  This will also discourage private investment, prompt key scientists to leave the country, and set back cancer research for decades.
One in two women and one in three men will get cancer in their life time. Cancer is the second leading cause of death, claiming 600,000 American lives annually. By the 1970s experts concluded that 80% of cancer is caused by environmental exposures, i.e. carcinogens we eat, smoke, breathe, swallow, or absorb. The incidence of 14 different cancers is steeply rising among those under 50.   And young people are getting more aggressive cancers that are growing more quickly and have a worse prognosis. In young adults symptoms are more likely to be dismissed, resulting in later, less treatable stages when diagnosed. Environmental factors are most likely to blame because the primary remaining culprit, genetics, doesn’t change that much over a generation.
I grew up one of eight children.  Five of us, including me, have had cancer, some with multiple types, and some of us are still fighting it.  Half of my own children are cancer victims. I’ve just spent weeks tending my delightful three year old granddaughter, Lana, because her mother is fighting for her life and will need every cancer treatment available, including perhaps a future mRNA vaccine. The cruel farce of  Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” is animated in real time, in the faces of the people I love and see every day.
Kennedy is slamming the door on the survival chances of millions of cancer victims, some of them will be the more than 14,000 Utahns diagnosed with cancer every year.

How university heads in other neighboring states stack up
University of Alabama System Chancellor Sid Trant takes home $884,716 after a 36% increase from his pay as interim chancellor approved in the spring, according to AL.com.
Peter Hans, University of North Carolina System president, also got a big raise this year, according to the News & Observer, going from about $455,000 to $600,000 on June 1.
Ray Rodrigues, Chancellor of the State University System of Florida, has a salary of $441,252, while Michael Amiridis of the University of South Carolina system makes $352,184, according to state data.
Randy Boyd, University of Tennessee System president, who is independently wealthy, takes no salary but reportedly accepts a $10,000 stipend to cover health insurance costs.


Chancellor Sonny Perdue, head of the University System of Georgia, could be getting a pay raise to the tune of $50,000, bringing his salary to $572,500.
The Board of Regents voted to move the raise forward Tuesday and kick off a 30-day waiting period before they can vote on the raise. The vote came at the very end of the board’s regular meeting, directly after an executive session in which members of the public were asked to leave the room and the livestream was cut off.
Perdue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“The proposal is not finalized and is part of a formal, transparent process that requires full Board of Regents review and approval,” said Board of Regents Chair T. Dallas Smith in a statement. “Following the required notice period, I know the Board will consider the proposal in the context of its responsibility to serve students, campuses and the public while being good stewards of state resources.”
Perdue, 78, was appointed chancellor by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2022. He previously served as secretary of agriculture from 2017 to 2021 under the first administration of President Donald Trump and as governor of Georgia for two terms, from 2003 to 2011.
According to data compiled by the Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts, Perdue’s salary in fiscal year 2024 was $531,900, which made him one the top-earning state employees in Georgia.
Compared with university system heads in the states bordering Georgia, Perdue’s salary is toward the middle of the pack and less than what the leaders of Alabama and North Carolina’s systems make following a couple big raises of their own.
The University System of Georgia has celebrated successes in recent months, including record enrollment numbers. Speaking at Tuesday’s meeting, Perdue touted a pair of recently released studies he said show the system’s economic impact to the state grew 5.4% in fiscal year 2024 and that the class of 2024 will earn on average $1.4 million more over their lifetimes than they would without a college degree.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Lawmakers are considering a bill to clarify the legislative veto process after Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s office appeared to accidentally line-item veto housing funding in May.
Armstrong in his veto message indicated he was vetoing $150,000 the 2025 Legislature set aside for a Native American homelessness liaison, but a staff member also crossed out $25 million for affordable housing and $10 million for homelessness in the bill markup.
The legislative and executive branches disagreed over how to interpret the line-item veto, leading to a larger dispute over the scope of the governor’s veto power.
The interim Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee on Wednesday advanced a bill draft lawmakers say will prevent similar conflicts from arising in the future.
The draft legislation would make it so that when a governor’s line-item veto message and bill markup conflict, the markup would be considered the authority on what the veto actually does. This is in contrast to a recent opinion by Attorney General Drew Wrigley that found that the bill markups are visual aids and do not change the substance of a veto.
The proposed bill would also provide more specific instructions on what should be included in each veto and which officials the governor’s office would send copies of the veto to.
“We don’t see this as infringing on the governor’s veto power in any way,” Emily Thompson, legal division director for Legislative Council, said of the draft during the meeting. 
The Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee voted to forward the proposal to Legislative Management.
The committee on Wednesday also discussed a bill draft to create a more formal mechanism for calling special sessions to override vetoes by the governor after the legislative session adjourns.
Legislative Council proposed a system where lawmakers are polled 21 days after the session on whether they want to reconvene for a veto override session.
The idea received a mixed response from committee members, in part because lawmakers only get 80 legislative days each biennium. 
North Dakota lawmakers not inclined to sue over veto

“Let’s say we’ve set aside three days — that’s all we have left — and we’re coming back to override a bill that really isn’t a substantial bill,” Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said. “We don’t want to burn our days just to override that.”
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, suggested earmarking a day well in advance for lawmakers to handle potential post-session vetoes. 
“For people like me who have to return to a day job and your boss would like to know what day you’re going to be gone, there is some benefit for having that future date pre-scheduled,” she said. “We can always cancel it.”
The committee asked Legislative Council to prepare an amended bill draft to reflect Roers’ suggestion for consideration at its next meeting.
Some lawmakers on Wednesday said the two bill drafts are also a way to address what they view as a separation of powers issue raised by the attorney general’s opinion on Armstrong’s line-item veto. 
The opinion, issued in June, found that the accidental markup didn’t create any problems because Armstrong was clear in his memo about what he intended to veto.
Legislators voiced concerns that the opinion could give the Governor’s Office and Attorney General’s Office broad discretion to decide the meaning of unclear vetoes.
“We want to make sure that there’s a balance, that the legislative branch is not losing any authority,” House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said during Wednesday’s meeting.
The Attorney General’s Office on Wednesday said it was not aware of the proposed legislation and did not have a position on it. The Governor’s Office also declined to comment on the legislation.
Legislative Council’s attorneys said previously in their own analysis that Wrigley’s opinion conflicts with legal precedent, including previous rulings by the North Dakota Supreme Court. 
They wrote that the Legislature could hold a special session and override the veto, though lawmakers have signaled they don’t intend to go that route. Wrigley previously called Legislative Council’s analysis a “political document” and said the agency doesn’t get to decide the scope of the governor’s authority. 
The Office of Management and Budget has already allocated the money at issue in the veto. The agency in an email last month confirmed it dispersed the $34.85 million to the Housing Finance Agency on July 1.

Phil Murphy speaks before signing legislation establishing the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program at MAC Products Inc. in Kearny on Aug. 13, 2025. (Jake Hirsch/Governor’s Office)Gov. Phil Murphy signed bipartisan legislation Thursday creating a $500 million tax credit program for manufacturing businesses in a bid to expand in-state manufacturing and spur job creation, with a focus on clean energy industries.
Murphy signed the bill at Mac Products, a family-owned manufacturing business in Kearny that makes electrical distribution and transmission products. The governor, a Democrat, said the tax credit program, to be administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, is designed to position the state as a manufacturing leader.
“With the most skilled workforce in the world, we have a unique opportunity to not only make our businesses more competitive today, but to prepare them to lead their respective industries for decades to come,” Murphy said.
The new initiative will award tax credits to eligible businesses in industries such as advanced manufacturing, nonretail food and beverage, defense, clean energy, and life sciences.
State Sen. Mike Testa (R-Cumberland), one of the bill’s chief sponsors, called the measure an example of government working on a “nonpartisan basis.” Testa referred to a sign he has in his office that replicates the famous “Trenton makes — the world takes” slogan seen on the Lower Trenton Bridge.
“This bill will go a long way to making sure that means something once again and remains meaning something 50, 60, 75 years to come,” he said.
For the first two years, $100 million in tax credits will be reserved for clean energy product manufacturers in solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen. Unused funds from that allocation will later be shifted to general manufacturing projects.
Tim Sullivan, CEO of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said the program is designed to reward companies that meet their commitments to invest in New Jersey.
“If you promise you’re going to do something, and you do it, you get the tax credits. If you don’t, you don’t get the tax credits,” Sullivan said.
Funding for the tax credits will come from reallocating money from the state’s existing Aspire and Emerge tax incentive programs, not from new spending, Murphy noted. Those two programs are expected to issue $6.6 billion in tax credits over their lives.
Business groups support the move.
“This law represents a significant and targeted investment for New Jersey’s manufacturing sector and our economy, with no new additional funding required,” New Jersey Business & Industry Association President and CEO Michele Siekerka said in a statement. “It will support much-needed workforce development in manufacturing amid both federal tariff and supply chain uncertainty that challenges these important businesses.”

North Dakota legislators are discussing ways to enhance lawmaker security. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota legislators are working to bolster security measures in response to shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, recommended during a committee discussion Wednesday that legislators adopt an official process to report threats.
“I’ve been threatened many times, and it rolls off me, but for some people, the first time they get threatened, it’s very frightening,” Hogan said. She said some lawmakers have “thick skin” and don’t report those incidents, but she suggested that should change after the killings in Minnesota.
“Then, if we get a pattern, we’re sensitive about it,” Hogan said during the Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee. “We’ve had to think differently than we’re ever had to think, and that’s the sad part.”
The discussion Wednesday came in response to the June 14 assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed in their Brooklyn Park home. Another state lawmaker, Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot multiple times but survived. Vance Boelter was apprehended after a 42-hour manhunt and faces six felony charges.
In the aftermath of those attacks, a North Dakota man was charged with sending threatening messages to at least one U.S. official and other state officials. The threats by Charles Dalzell of St. Thomas referenced the Minnesota shootings, court records say. A jury trial is set for this fall.
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Legislative Council has accumulated a mailbox full of letters and numerous voicemails from the man, Director John Bjornson said.
“It is something that is fairly common that we deal with on a regular basis,” Bjornson said.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said he received a threat from Dalzell.
“I don’t know how he got my cellphone number,” Weisz said. “He was ranting and raving about the governor and how I need to force the governor to follow the law.”
Weisz said he explained to the man that he does not control the governor or the state courts, which prompted the man to hang up.
Weisz said he didn’t report the matter to law enforcement, but said he should have followed up with the governor.
Separately, Weisz said he’s received emails threatening his children.
“I’ve even had an email where a lady said, ‘I just want you to know, I know where you live,’ and so I emailed her back and said, ‘Great, when can I expect you.’ Never heard from her again,” he said.
Weisz said he will not be intimidated or bullied for representing his district in the Legislature.
Any reports of threats against lawmakers received by Legislative Council are reported to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, Bjornson said.
Emily Thompson, director of the legal division for Legislative Council, said a more in-depth discussion on lawmaker security will continue at the next committee meeting. Immediately following the Minnesota attacks, Legislative Council removed home addresses of North Dakota lawmakers from the Legislature’s website. Other measures being discussed include providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and offering safety training.
“Here in North Dakota, we’ve just taken our security somewhat for granted,” said Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, committee chair.

Building off a nearly $80,000 grant from 2024, Grand View University in Des Moines announced in a news release it received $30,000 this year to once again expand its educational equipment for nursing students.
While the 2024 grant helped the university purchase a “patient manikin” for its nursing simulation suite, according to the release, this year’s funding will go toward the purchase of a “simulated medication distribution cart” to show students how to use the equipment they’ll most likely see in hospitals once they start their career. The release stated funds will also be used to support an annual event for student athletes and their supporters held by Grand View.

Simpson College in Indianola also received a nearly $10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows for buying additional human anatomical models, according to a news release, which will be utilized by students studying to enter a health science field.
Grand View University President Rachelle Keck said in the news release grant funding from Prairie Meadows is helping the university instill in students “the skills needed to provide exceptional patient care.”
“As Iowa experiences a shortage of nurses, Grand View is proud to partner with Prairie Meadows to ensure our nursing graduates are well-prepared to meet patient and community needs,” Keck said in the release.
According to a list of grant recipients for the Prairie Meadows Legacy Grant program, Mercy College of Health Sciences also received a $650,000 grant for its school of nursing. Drake University received a legacy grant worth $600,000 for stadium renovations and another grant through the company’s Community Betterment Grant program.
Other institutions that received community betterment grants include the Des Moines Area Community College Foundation and Des Moines University.
According to a news release from Prairie Meadows, the nonprofit organization dispensed more than $13 million through just over 400 grants, of which hundreds of thousands of dollars were allocated to colleges for capital projects and academic programs.
“It’s an honor to invest in our community through these grant dollars,” said Gary Palmer, president and CEO of Prairie Meadows, in the news release. “We’re committed to empowering local nonprofits that drive meaningful change and strengthen our communities. Giving back is part of who we are, and this funding reflects our support of organizations that uplift Iowans by bringing hope, opportunity, and lasting impact.”

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Judith Deedy said there’s been a disconnect for a decade in Kansas’ student assessment scores.
Her oldest child once earned fives — the highest level at the time — until 2015, when she began scoring at level three after the assessment scores changed.
“The Kansas assessment has persistently been an outlier for all of the three children in my own family and for thousands of students across the state, as data has shown,” Deedy, a public education advocate, said at a Tuesday meeting of the Kansas State Board of Education.
State assessment scores have shown a steady increase in the number of Kansas students scoring lower on math, science and English language arts tests since 2016, while achieving marks of post-secondary success, such as higher education degrees and military careers.
The state education board voted 7-3 on Tuesday to change assessment cut scores in the 2025-2026 school year, broadening the scoring range and shrinking the tests. Board members Michelle Dombrosky, Connie O’Brien and Debby Potter voted against resetting the scores.
In partnership with the University of Kansas and with input from nearly 150 educators, the Kansas State Department of Education crafted new metrics for the assessment tests students periodically take in English language arts, math and science throughout their school careers.
Cut scores divide performance levels, reflecting student achievement.
Following the board’s vote, cut scores are undergoing an expansion. Previously, the scoring scale ranged from 220-380, with cutoffs varying by grade, level and subject.
Now, the lowest obtainable score is 400 across all grades and subjects, and the highest is 700. Level two cuts off at 510, and the level three cutoff is 540 for all grades and subjects. The level four cutoff varies by grade and subject.
In May, the board approved new performance definitions for each level. Previously, scores fell into the following levels: limited, basic, effective and excellent. Now, “limited” and “basic” remain for levels one and two, but “effective” was changed to “proficient” and “excellent” to “advanced.”
Beth Fultz, director of career standards and assessment services for the education department, addressed the board before its vote. She said it “was an opportunity to impact Kansas education for several years to come.”
Beryl New, a board member from Topeka, said she has heard from constituents who are concerned the state education department is lowering standards.
Fultz responded that the change is more of a realignment of expectations for student performance.
“I do believe we are not reducing the rigor on this assessment,” Fultz said.
The state education commissioner, Randy Watson, said the department brought to the table “a scientifically based process that’s nationally recognized,” and came from the voices of teachers. He assured the board that the new scores still set the highest expectations for Kansas kids.
Deedy, who spoke during the board’s public forum section at the beginning of the meeting, said the old cut scores overshot a desire to be aspirational.
“Adjusting cut scores is not lowering our standards,” Deedy said, ”but rather improving the predictability and reliability of this point-in-time assessment to more accurately reflect student achievement levels.”
Danny Zeck, a board member from Leavenworth, said he struggles with assessments. He said he was once what he called “a level one kid.”
Zeck, following a long pause, said: “The problem I have with level one, two, three and four is that level one person wakes up sometime and they’re gonna be successful.”
Everybody reacts differently, he said.
He also encouraged parents, if they do not agree with the new cut scores, to exempt their students from participating in assessments.
“C’mon, people,” he said. “If you really dislike it, opt them out. It’s not a rocket science deal.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7080376-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-13 21:18:26+00:00,CT Mirror,CT electric rates to drop in September as a result of state borrowing,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/ct-electric-rate-relief-borrowing/,The $155M in state borrowing will result in lower utility rates for Eversource and UI customers on their monthly bills starting in September.,"Connecticut electric rates will dip slightly in September, after utility regulators voted on Wednesday to formalize a relief package centered around $155 million in state borrowing to offset the cost of sky-high electric bills.
The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted unanimously to approve new rates for customers of the state’s two investor-owned utilities — Eversource and United Illuminating — that take into account the impact of that borrowing. The new, lower rates will take effect on Sept. 1.
The change will result in an average savings of around $9 a month for Eversource customers and $15 a month for UI customers, according to PURA. The exact amount of savings will vary depending on usage and whether the customer receives residential or commercial rates.
“We’re pleased customers will see a decrease thanks to several factors, including shifting certain state-mandated policy and program costs off electric bills,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in a statement following Wednesday’s decision. 
Sarah Wall Fliotsos, a spokeswoman for United Illuminating, said in a statement that the new rates will “have a meaningful impact,” and she expressed appreciation for the state’s decision to borrow money to fund the rate cuts. 
“We look forward to implementing these electric bill reductions for our customers while remaining mindful that several new public policy programs that would be added to the Public Benefits Charge in the future remain under consideration,” she said.
The rate change didn’t prompt any public discussion among the three members of PURA — Chairwoman Marissa Gillett, Vice Chairman David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron — before they voted to approve it in a virtual meeting Wednesday.
Gov. Ned Lamont introduced the borrowing plan to the State Bond Commission earlier this month, where it received unanimous approval. The plan itself was crafted by lawmakers earlier this year as part of Senate Bill 4, an omnibus legislative package addressing energy prices.
The bonding component of that bill included $125 million this year to pay off unpaid bills that accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with $30 million to cover the costs associated with the state’s electric vehicle charging program. Both costs are currently paid for by consumers as part of the public benefits charge on their bill.
An additional round of borrowing is expected to go before the Bond Commission next year, with the associated savings lasting through 2027. 
Claire Coleman, head of the state’s Office of Consumer Counsel, said in a statement Wednesday, “As one of the biggest advocates for state assistance to offset high electricity costs this session, I am pleased that customers will see the results of the bond funding authorization beginning in September.” 
Ratliff, the Eversource spokeswoman, said that “even more significant savings” can be achieved through other aspects of S.B. 4 that have yet to be fully implemented. Those include allowing utilities to securitize costs related to storm damage and the roll out of advanced metering technology.
“The collaboration on Senate Bill 4 was an important step forward to make progress on these issues for customers, and we look forward to continued work with lawmakers to deliver cost-effective solutions to benefit the people and businesses of Connecticut,” she said in her statement. 
Wednesday’s decision marked the third time this year PURA has voted to lower electric rates. The first reduction came in April, as part of regulators’ annual rate adjustment proceedings. Two months later, PURA approved a reduction in supply rates for customers of both utilities.
Those decreases followed last year’s spike in the public benefits charge that happened to coincide with a summer heat wave that sent many bills — and public frustration — soaring to new highs. 
Even with decreases taking effect this year, advocates and the utilities warn that some customers may have yet to see a decrease in their overall bill due to growing usage to power air conditioners during the hot summer months.
Connecticut’s electricity costs remain among the highest in the nation. In August, the state ranked third with an average of 26.16 cents per kilowatt hour, according to an analysis by ElectricChoice.com.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PUBLIC-BENEFITS-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

Vermont regulators also grilled executives from the hospital network and UVM Medical Center about revenue overages, profit margins, and lowering charges to commercial insurance during an annual budget hearing this week.

A tense exchange between health care leaders on Monday punctuated the annual, multiday marathon hospital budget hearings before the Green Mountain Care Board. 
The discourse focused on a letter from an independent health care liaison that described a “simmering and ongoing adversarial relationship” between the state’s largest hospital network and its largest health insurer. 
The letter conveys Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont’s claim that University of Vermont Health Network leaders allegedly threatened to drop patients on the carrier’s insurance plans to pressure the insurer to accept higher network charges in previous years. Network representatives disputed this characterization at the hearing.
Regulators also asked health network executives about revenue overages and profit margins at the University of Vermont Medical Center, the state’s only academic medical center and the only one certified for the highest level of trauma care.
Health care regulators hold extensive hearings annually on the budgets proposed by Vermont’s hospitals for the next fiscal year, but one day of meetings typically impacts Vermonters’ health care costs more than the rest. This year, that was Monday, when all day was spent reviewing the proposals by the University of Vermont Health Network’s three hospitals in the state.
That’s because a big share of what is spent on Vermonters’ health care goes to the state’s hospitals, almost half the money spent in 2022, according to one dataset analyzed by board staff. And the three network hospitals — University of Vermont Medical Center in the Burlington area, Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin and Porter Medical Center in Middlebury — together earn almost two thirds of the money spent on behalf of patients at the 14 hospitals under board review. 

This year, for the first time in recent memory, two network hospitals submitted proposed reductions to commercial insurance rates in the coming fiscal year for the board’s approval.
Also, for the first time, the board dug deeply into the budget and finances of the overall University of Vermont Health Network.
The Green Mountain Care Board set benchmarks for Vermont hospitals this coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, to not exceed a 3.5% increase for net patient revenue, which the regulatory board defines as earnings from patient services after certain deductions such as uncompensated care. Other benchmarks set by the regulator are a 3% increase both for hospital operating expenses and for charges to commercial health insurance companies. 
University of Vermont Medical Center is seeking a 2.2% increase to its net patient revenue. The center also expects to increase operating expenses by 3% and decrease what it charges commercial insurers by 7.9%.
Central Vermont Medical Center requested a 3.5% increase to net patient revenue, a 2.8% increase for operating expenses and a 3.6% decrease to commercial rates. 

The reduction in commercial insurance charges put forth by the two medical centers comes after the Green Mountain Care Board entered a settlement in April with their parent health network related to those two hospitals exceeding the patient revenue caps set by the board through this process in the 2024 and 2023 fiscal years. 
A new law capping pharmaceutical drugs costs accounts for the majority of the two hospitals’ commercial rate reductions, alongside compliance with the enforcement settlement.
Health network officials projected last week that the University of Vermont Medical Center will exceed budget caps for the current fiscal year as well, also part of the hospital’s proposed 2026 rate reduction.
Porter Medical Center, a federally-designated critical access hospital — one of eight in the state — asked for a 3.5% increase to net patient revenue, a 2.4% increase to operating expenses and 3% increase to commercial rates. The designation, intended for hospitals that provide care in rural, underserved areas, requires higher reimbursements tied to costs from Medicare. 
Late last month, just prior to the start of hospital budget review hearings, the University of Vermont Health Network announced cost saving measures, including layoffs and workforce reductions, particularly in network-wide administrative services, in order to meet the 2026 fiscal year hospital budget proposals.

‘Lingering animosity’
Board chair Owen Foster, a former federal prosecutor, asked University of Vermont Health Network executives to respond to the letter the board had received last week from Mike Smith, who the board had appointed as an independent liaison to a new working group required by the legal settlement.
The letter dated Thursday gave an update on private negotiations between leaders at the network and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which were convened with the goal of finding “common ground on cost reductions to lower commercial health insurance rates for 2026, and hopefully beyond.” The update, which included the liaison team’s own recommendations for the Green Mountain Care Board, was also sent to the Department of Financial Regulation, the state’s main insurance regulator.
The discussion between the UVM Health Network and Blue Cross Blue Shield had broken down due to what Smith described in the letter as “lingering animosity” between the health network and insurance carrier.
Despite the insurer being on the brink of insolvency, Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont officials said they have not negotiated assertively over rates in past years because the Health Network had threatened to cease serving Blue Cross patients if the insurer did not cede to their demands, according to Smith’s letter.
At the board meeting Monday, Kelly Champney, a health network vice president, denied that the University of Vermont Medical Center threatened to not serve Blue Cross patients in negotiations in recent years. 
“I know we have gotten to very tough conversations before,” Champney said. “To my knowledge, there’s not been a termination conversation.”
Smith’s liaison team offered their own recommendations to further lower commercial health insurance rates for the next fiscal year. They included capping reimbursement of health services at 500% of the Medicare payment rate to prevent “excessive cost,” a version of so-called reference-based pricing incorporated into a law signed earlier this summer.
Smith also said the leaders of the Health Network and Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont should meet regularly to develop a “healthy working relationship.”

Over revenue cap again this year
Amid hearings about the next fiscal year, the UVM Medical Center and Central Vermont Medical Center leaders met with the board last Wednesday to discuss how to address projected overages to hospital patient revenue in the hospitals’ current fiscal year, which ends September 30. 
A hospital’s net patient revenue is the result of both the price of the service provided and the number of patients who receive it, a measure often referred to as ‘utilization.’ Health network hospitals attribute their recent revenue overages largely to more patients seeking more services than anticipated. 
Hospital leaders told regulators that the University of Vermont Medical Center is looking to reduce commercial insurer revenue by $20 million and Central Vermont Medical Center is looking to reduce revenue by $6 million through targeted rate reductions. A large portion of those reductions would be realized in the coming fiscal year, not the current one, because of the late date.
Rick Vincent, executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer for the health network, said the network would have looked to adjust its rates in early May, but had to assess a price cap on outpatient-administered injection drugs then being considered by the Vermont Legislature and later signed into law. 
“The delay was really due to trying to understand exactly what was happening with the drug legislation and how that might impact our budgets going forward,” Vincent said. 
Mark Hengstler, staff attorney for the Green Mountain Care Board, said the board only sets commercial health insurance rate upper limits, not rates themselves, so it is within hospital prerogative to lower rates to meet their set patient revenue cap at any time. 
After questioning from new board member Sara Teachout — formerly an executive and spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont — Vincent said that even with the reductions proposed, the University of Vermont Medical Center is projected to end the year over the revenue cap by around $2 million, and may again be subject to regulatory enforcement action. 
At the hearing Monday, Green Mountain Care Board member Thom Walsh asked how the board should view the University of Vermont Medical Center’s budget projections for the coming 2026 fiscal year given the hospital’s underestimation of service utilization that in the recent past has led to revenue overages, regulatory enforcements and mid-year commercial health insurance rate adjustments. 
Judy Peek-Lee, chief financial officer for the University of Vermont Medical Center, said their methods for making projections have not changed, but staff have developed better communication between departments to more quickly recognize any upticks in how patients are using services.
Peek-Lee said that the academic medical center’s focus on special services and advancements in the medical field make it more difficult to project out costs for the coming fiscal year compared to community hospitals, but that staff will continue to assess budget projections throughout the coming year. 
While past overages in net patient revenue are high in dollar amounts, as a percentage of the medical center’s overall budget, the number is relatively small, she said.

Network ‘centralization and consolidation’
During a new afternoon session on Monday, the board delved into the expenses of the parent organization, University of Vermont Health Network, itself. 
Green Mountain Care Board member Jessica Holmes expressed concern with the increased “centralization and consolidation” of shared services to improve quality care measures and population health outcomes among network hospitals — three in Vermont and three in New York — represented in the increased size of the network’s budget. 
Holmes noted that while the network spent more on these services in recent years, federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality ratings for their hospitals diminished between fiscal years 2022 and 2026.
The University of Vermont Medical and Porter Medical Center is currently at a three star federal rating and Central Vermont Medical Center is at two stars, with similar ratings at the New York hospitals, Holmes said. That means that “half of your hospitals are in the bottom third of all hospitals in the country, and none are in the top third,” she said.
Stephen Leffler, president and chief operating officer of University of Vermont Medical Center, said that the hospital’s leadership and staff lost focus on maintaining high quality care ratings during the pandemic, but recent data shows that the academic medical center is making progress to improve ratings. 
“We’ve started that climb,” Leffler said. “We have to sustain that and make it better. I am confident that the network has heard what we’re asking for and that we will do better, but we’re not where we need to be.”
Board chair Foster asked network executives about how funds flow from hospitals to the network, particularly from University of Vermont Medical Center and the New York hospitals.
Sunny Eappen, president and CEO of the University of Vermont Health Network, conceded upon questioning that the New York hospitals’ contributions to network operations are currently not sufficient. He said the network will be looking for higher commercial rates for the New York hospitals.
“The commercial negotiations in New York have looked very, very different than they have in Vermont the last few years. The increases that we’re seeking are much larger. They’re going to be much larger again this year,” Eappen said. “We do the same thing in terms of advocating at the state for additional funding, so the same things that we’re doing in Vermont, we’re doing in New York.”
Maintaining affiliations with the New York hospitals is still a net positive for Vermont, Eappen said, because it increases capacity and access to special services. It also keeps patients from eastern New York seeking care from overwhelming Vermont hospitals, because “patients don’t follow borders.”
Foster probed further, asking why the Board should grant the network hospitals’ budget requests given “competing interests,” such as the state’s cash-strapped, largest health insurer and Vermonters facing a health care affordability crisis. This suggests that the board might consider lowering the patient revenue caps or further lowering the commercial rate reduction proposed by the larger hospitals. 
Eappen responded that the health network would have to continue deferring maintenance on capital projects, and would not be able to maintain the same level of care and services to the region if hospitals’ rate requests were not met. 
Reflecting on what he had heard on Monday, board Member David Murman, who is an emergency room doctor at Central Vermont Medical Center, noted that the University of Vermont Medical Center’s profits swamp that of all other hospitals in the state, and alone represent about half of all hospital revenue this year. 
Green Mountain Care Board staff calculated the profit margin expected by the 14 Vermont hospitals in fiscal year 2025 based on their end-of-year projections, some of which are negative, meaning they’ve experienced operating losses. The analysis highlighted that because of its size, the University of Vermont Medical Center’s 3% positive margin, around $72 million, accounted for almost 95% of all the profit likely across the entire system, estimated at $76.1 million.
Murman, who is not participating in decisions related to his direct employer, also said that the University of Vermont Health Network as a whole is a large player in the state’s healthcare landscape and many Vermonters rely on network hospitals for their care and livelihoods. 
But operations at the University of Vermont Medical Center in particular have an outsized impact on commercial insurance rates, Murman said. That’s because the academic medical center sees a larger proportion of commercially insured patients than other hospitals in the state, 26% compared to less than 20% on average, according to board staff. The other patients at all hospitals are largely covered by the federal and state insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid, which generally pay much lower rates for services than commercial health insurance. 
“While you enjoy massive market power, very high commercial prices, and a remarkably strong payer mix compared to the region that you live in, you also hold the responsibility to not take too much advantage of that,” Murman said.

The Two Mississippi Museums and the Emmett Till Interpretive Center are holding events dedicated to Till and the impact of his death, inspired by the anniversaries.

The side-by-side museums in Jackson – the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History –  continued a tradition of conducting tours on Till’s birthday, July 25. Visitors sat in the center of the civil rights museum, where a guide recounted Till’s story and its impact on the Civil Rights Movement. People could also enter a small gallery to watch a documentary about his life.
DeSean Dyson, a Jackson native, said he considers Till’s life essential to his own work. His job takes him around the U.S. to promote peace and justice initiatives.
“It’s very important to me, as I have a 10-year-old, a 12-year-old and a 16-year-old, that they stay rooted and connected to this history,” said Dyson, a former educator who took his sons to tour the museums. 
He said teachings about Till should emphasize his humanity.
“Like, it’s really important how we frame Emmett’s death as being inspiring to a generation, but Emmett’s life mattered a lot,” Dyson said.

Michael Morris, director of the Two Mississippi Museums, said he wants people to understand the broad context of Till’s life and death.
“I hope visitors learn about not just the fact that he was murdered, which is important, but also the fact that his life really did stimulate, encourage, inspire a lot of youth his age to become a part of the modern Civil Rights Movement,” Morris said.
Longtime civil rights activist Hezekiah Watkins of Jackson volunteers at the civil rights museum in various roles, often speaking about his life story. In 1961, he was just 13 when he was arrested at Jackson’s Greyhound bus station. Authorities thought he was part of the Freedom Riders, a racially integrated group of young people who rode interstate buses through the South to challenge segregation. Watkins and the Freedom Riders were sent to the Mississippi State Penitentiary and housed on death row.

Watkins recounted that when he told his mother he was joining the Civil Rights Movement, she used Till’s death as a warning: “She said, ‘You remember me telling you about Emmett Till?’ She said, ‘The same thing that happened to Emmett will happen to you.’
“I guess I really didn’t care,” Watkins said, “because I didn’t know that we was living in bondage … I didn’t know we was living as slaves, per se.”
In August 1955, 14-year-old Till traveled from Chicago to the Mississippi Delta to visit his cousins. Till and other young Black people went to buy snacks one day at Bryant’s Grocery & Meat Market in the tiny community of Money. Till’s cousin Simeon Wright later said he heard Till whistle at the white storekeeper, Carolyn Bryant, as they left.

Days later, a group that included Carolyn’s husband Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam kidnapped Till from the home of Moses Wright, Till’s great-uncle. They beat Till, shot him and dumped him in the Tallahatchie River, using barbed wire to attach a 75-pound cotton gin fan to him. His body was discovered three days later, decomposed beyond recognition except for his father’s ring on one of his fingers.
Mississippi authorities wanted a quick burial, but Till’s mother Mamie Till-Mobley requested his body be returned to Chicago. After seeing the horrific condition of her son’s corpse, she insisted on an open-casket funeral so the world could see what had happened. 
Jet magazine published a photo of mutilated Till’s body at his funeral, launching the killing into an international news story. Weeks later, an all-white jury in Mississippi acquitted Milam and Bryant of murdering Till. Outrage over the injustice of the case helped launch the Civil Rights Movement, inspiring many Black people to openly oppose Jim Crow.

Today, the courthouse where Till’s killers were acquitted is restored and is a National Park Service site. The restoration was done by the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, formed in 2006 by Jerome G. Little, the Tallahatchie County Board of Supervisors’ first Black president.
The commission was dedicated to remembering Till and healing racial division. It went on to become a nonprofit organization and establish the Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner. 
The center is hosting a Till commemoration Aug. 28-30 at Mississippi Valley State University’s Walter Roberts Auditorium.
Benjamin Saulsberry is the museum’s public engagement and education director. He said the impact of Till’s death is still felt today by people who remember the terrible events of that hot Mississippi summer.

“We’re talking about people who are still alive with us, people who were lawmakers or about to become lawmakers themselves … and in turn, their ideologies and their spaces have helped – or in some ways maybe not helped — shape the world that we live in today,” he said.
The three-day commemoration will focus on Till, his mother and the impact of Till’s lynching in the Delta. The programming includes a theatrical performance, an award-winning biographical exhibit and panels with people discussing their accounts of watching Till’s story. Registration for the commemoration is on the center’s website.
Saulsberry hopes visitors come away from the commemoration knowing more about Till and the Delta, that they feel inspired to continue learning and that they know they can create change in their own lives.

He acknowledged Till’s death was a tragedy, but said people should remember the action it inspired. 
“And I want to be clear that it marks the 70th year after his murder, but also marks the 70th year of Mrs. Mamie Till making the decision she made that would help basically, bring us to another part of the Civil Rights Movement,” Saulsberry said. “It’s the 70th year anniversary point of recognition where Mr. Moses Wright stands up in that courtroom and points directly at Milam and Bryant, knowing he was putting his own life at risk.”

(Photo by Grace Deng/Washington State Standard)A federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to give the operator of the immigrant detention center in Tacoma another chance to make its case for paying detainees as little as $1 per day.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request from The GEO Group, the for-profit company that runs the facility, to reconsider its decision from earlier this year, siding with lower courts that found GEO violated state minimum wage law.
The decision affirms that the Florida-based GEO Group will need to pay more than $23 million that a jury and federal judge previously awarded. The next step in the company’s fight could be the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, brought by detainees and the state of Washington, has been ongoing since 2017.
GEO Group has run the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma since 2005. Its current contract with the federal government, signed in 2015, awarded the company at least $700 million to operate the facility over the following decade. The facility holds people detained by federal immigration enforcement on civil violations as they await potential deportation or release back into the United States.
The company used to run a voluntary work program for detainees. For years, hundreds at the Tacoma detention center were paid $1 per day, the minimum federal pay required in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. When necessary to attract workers, pay would go up to $5. 
The program allowed GEO to avoid hiring 85 full-time employees, according to court filings. The detainees would cook and serve food, wash dishes, do laundry and clean the facility.
GEO’s federal contract requires it to comply with “all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards,” including “labor laws and codes.” This includes state minimum wage laws, courts have ruled.
The company had argued federal contractors couldn’t be forced to pay Washington’s minimum wage under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which holds that federal law takes precedence over state law. 
GEO contended Washington can’t regulate the detention center differently than similar state facilities, since the state’s minimum wage law exempts prisons and jails.
A U.S. District Court jury in 2021 found GEO Group violated Washington’s minimum wage statute, and awarded nearly $17.3 million in back wages. A federal judge ordered the company to pay the state an additional $5.9 million in penalties. The work program has been suspended since then.
Between 2010 and 2018, GEO made around $20 million per year running the 1,575-bed detention center.
Washington’s state Supreme Court also sided with the detainees and the state, finding in 2023 that the detained workers should be considered employees. 
On this go-around, GEO asked the original three-judge 9th Circuit panel either to rehear the case or send it to the full appeals court in what is known as a rehearing en banc. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice also urged the court to reconsider. The court denied the requests Wednesday.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Dissenting from the decision, Judge Patrick Bumatay, an appointee of President Donald Trump, wrote that “the effect of this decision will be widespread.”
“Our court provides a ‘roadmap’ for States seeking to undermine federal policies with which they disagree,” Bumatay wrote. “Our court’s message is clear: So long as States focus their regulation on federal government contractors — rather than on the federal government itself — the States may frustrate the performance of any federal government activities they wish.”
Chief Judge Mary Murguia, who President Barack Obama appointed, disagreed. She wrote that Bumatay equating the federal government and its contractors is “contrary to long-settled black letter law.”
“Adoption of his position would allow any government contractor to refuse to pay state-mandated minimum wage to its employees,” she continued. “For example, any defense contractor could refuse to pay minimum wage. No one in this case, not even GEO, has suggested that this is the law.”
The facility, the only private, for-profit detention center in Washington, has a history of allegations of human rights violations. It has come under renewed scrutiny as more detainees have been sent there with Trump’s return to office. 
The Legislature has long had the detention center in its sights. Lawmakers tried to get it shut down in 2021 through a state law that was later deemed unenforceable. 
Washington has also been ensconced in years of legal back-and-forth with GEO over state laws calling for greater oversight of the facility. Another court case tackling that issue is currently awaiting a ruling from the 9th Circuit.

House seat, was sentenced to 80 years in prison Wednesday. (Photo from his official campaign Twitter feed in mid-November)A failed Republican political candidate whose conspiracy theory about a stolen state House election prompted him to orchestrate shootings at homes of elected New Mexico Democrats will spend 80 years in prison, a federal judge ordered Wednesday.
Solomon Peña – who handily lost the race for an Albuquerque-based house district in 2022 – falsely believed he was the victim of a election fraud and hatched a “sophisticated scheme” to harass and intimidate elected officials, U.S. District Court Judge Kea Riggs said in court during the sentencing hearing.
Election results showed Peña, who ran as a Republican, lost to incumbent Democrat Miguel Garcia, who won 74% of the vote.
The sentence comes amid a spike in political violence in recent years, including the June assassination of a Minnesota Democratic state representative and her husband. As he campaigned, Peña was a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, who falsely claimed he won the 2020 presidential election over Joe Biden. Trump has pardoned his supporters convicted in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and repeatedly threatened his political enemies, and he was the victim of two assassination attempts himself in 2024.
Failed GOP candidate accused of plotting to have co-defendants killed

A jury in March found Peña guilty of enlisting a man and his adult son to repeatedly shoot up homes of four elected Democratic officials in December 2022 and January 2023 after he refused to accept defeat. He was also convicted of recruiting fellow inmates he was in jail with while awaiting trial to kill his codefendants.
The shooting rampage  culminated in the early morning hours of Jan. 3, 2023, when, according to prosecutors, Peña and the 21-year-old man he enlisted fired a fully automatic gun at the home where state Sen. Linda Lopez and her children lived. Codefendant Jose Trujillo fired 12 rounds at her home, prosecutors said. Peña himself attempted to fire the weapon but it jammed, according to Riggs and prosecutors.
Lopez testified Wednesday before the sentencing that she and her kids are still traumatized. They’ve all sought counseling for anxiety and depression. Fireworks and other loud noises make them fearful, she said, and they are afraid whenever anyone walks past their house.
“The shooting of our home shattered what I was trying to form for my children,” she said.
Despite the shooting, she ran for reelection in November and won. The choice to stay in office represented her commitment to democracy, she said, and being undeterred by political violence.
“Our democracy must be open. Our democracy must not bend to intimidation or fear,” she said. “We will persevere.”
A jury ruled that Peña also orchestrated the shootings at the homes of other elected Democrats, including Bernalillo County Commissioners Adriann Barboa and Debbie O’Malley, who is now a state senator, as well as House Speaker Javier Martinez.
Failed GOP candidate for NM House charged in connection to shootings at Dem politicians’ homes

Martinez and his wife, Dianna, also attended Wednesday’s sentencing. Dianna Martinez recounted finding spent bullets in her shower and garage, and said she keeps replaying the shooting over and over, thinking about how if bullet trajectories had been “slightly different,” she and her children could have been injured or killed.
She called on the judge to hold Peña accountable for his actions, calling him a “narcissist” who has “no regard for human life.” Speaker Martinez draped his arm over his wife’s shoulders as she spoke through tears.
“This was not politics,” she said. “It was terror. “
Peña did not speak in his own defense. Through his attorneys, he said he maintained his innocence and would appeal the conviction. He appeared stoic throughout the one-hour hearing and did not react to the sentencing that, if served completely, will keep the 42-year-old man in prison through the end of his life.
Prosecutors called on the judge to sentence him to 90 years in prison, saying in court documents that his actions represented an attack on the “American political system.” Peña hoped to force “political change by terrorizing people into being too afraid to engage in political life if they held views contrary to his own,” prosecutors said.
His attorneys asked for the mandatory minimum of 60 years, noting that mandatory minimums tied the judges hands but that other federal defendants are sentenced to less time for what they said are worse crimes, like murder and sexual abuse.
Second co-conspirator in Solomon Peña case pleads guilty

Riggs did not fully explain why she arrived at a sentence of 80 years, but she said it was, at least in part, an effort to deter others from considering similar actions and to restore public servants’ trust that they can safely run for office.
Peña’s crimes were “all because you could not believe that you lost an election,” she told him. Saying it was “beyond a miracle” that no one was physically harmed, she recounted the path of violence that she believes would have continued to escalate if police hadn’t arrested his codefendant less than 24 hours after the shooting at Lopez’s home.
“All for what?” she told him. “For your ego.”
In addition to the 80-year sentence, Peña will face a $250,000 fine. The judge, whom Trump appointed in 2019, noted that Peña’s career as a “storm-chaser” meant he was not indigent and therefore capable of paying the fine. According to the judge and prosecutors, that profession defrauds insurance companies by billing them for overpriced and unnecessary repairs after natural disasters.
He will also be ordered to pay restitution, though the details of that were not clear Wednesday.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FhqHADcVIAM6cl9-1024x873.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

Larry Rhoden.
The governor said Wednesday that the inmates will be transferred to federal custody for deportation proceedings.
“South Dakota taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for illegal alien criminals,” Rhoden said in a news release.
The inmates were chosen by the Department of Corrections based on their immigration status, low-risk classification and closeness to the end of their sentence, the news release said. Each case was reviewed by the South Dakota Board of Pardons and Paroles.
The inmates came from Mexico, Sudan, Liberia, Canada, Somalia, Cuba and Ethiopia. Their crimes included burglary, possession of controlled substances, theft, assault and rape, among others.
The action comes on the heels of the Department of Corrections pursuing an agreement to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement, as part of an initiative Rhoden has dubbed Operation Prairie Thunder. The Highway Patrol and Division of Criminal Investigation have similar agreements.

(Photo by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

(Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks photo)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks issued warrants for the arrest of a Michigan father and son, following a series of wildlife violations in Treasure County, the department said in a Wednesday press release.
Ronald Schubert and his son, Chad Schubert, both of Belleville, Michigan, have each been charged with felony unlawful possession of a trophy bull elk.
Additionally, Chad Schubert has been charged with an additional felony for tampering with evidence and four misdemeanors including: hunting during a closed season; failure to obtain landowner permission for hunting; waste of a game animal; and violation of a commission or department rule for failure to return to a kill site.
Ronald Schubert has also been charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass.
According to FWP, the Rosebud County Sheriff’s Office provided information about the wildlife violations to the department. An investigation by an FWP warden found that Chad Schubert allegedly killed a trophy bull elk without a valid permit. The animal was killed on private land, with a rifle, during archery-only season. The elk’s head was removed and transported and the rest of the animal was “left to waste,” the release said.
Further investigation showed that Ronald Schubert was present at the time and allegedly assisted with removal and transport of the head and antlers.
Chad Schubert also faces additional pending charges for violations related to the hunting of deer, antelope, turkeys and mountain lions in Rosebud County, the release said.
Rosebud County Sheriff’s Office, Treasure County Attorney’s Office, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources all assisted in the investigation, FWP said in a release.
Penalties for the violations include more $60,000 in fines and restitution, as well as possible imprisonment in a county detention center, and loss of privileges to hunt, fish and trap.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed.png,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

As President Trump orders federal troops into the streets of Washington, D.C. to “do whatever the hell they want” to stop crime, Sen. Peter Welch is traveling across Vermont to share what he insists is the real news that Trump is trying to divert attention from.


Welch has tallied the impact of President Trump’s economic policies and determined that they will cost families in Vermont an average of $2,120 each year. He says that 99.5%  of all Vermont families will lose money as a result of   Trump’s tariffs and his budget reconciliation bill, which the Senate narrowly passed in early July after Vice President J.D. Vance cast a tie-breaking vote.
The Vermont Conversation caught up with Welch at Snow Farm Vineyard in South Hero, where Welch held a listening session attended by about 150 people.
Welch conceded that even he is “shocked” by the devastating impact of what he calls the “big ugly bill.” His office released a list of those impacts, including:

As many as 45,000 Vermonters will lose health care
As much as $1.7 billion in lost revenue for Vermont hospitals
Over 26,000 Vermonters will lose access to discounted premiums on the Affordable Care Act marketplace
6,000 Vermonters are at risk of losing SNAP assistance
Annual energy bills for Vermonters will rise by $290
The state will lose 1,400 jobs by ending green energy projects
Mortgage payments will rise by $1,060 annually
78,000 Vermonters with student loans will pay $3,694 more over the course of their loans

These cuts will shred the country’s social safety net, and undo social programs that date back to President Roosevelt’s New Deal and President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.
“There (were) a lot of lies that were peddled by the administration and frankly by many of my Republican colleagues about how great the bill was,” Welch said, while “ignoring the concrete reality” of how it will hurt the people they represent. Welch said Trump’s budget will add about $4.5 trillion to the federal deficit.
In a rare criticism of Governor Phil Scott, Welch slammed the governor’s recent decision to provide the Trump administration sensitive data on thousands of Vermonters who receive nutrition assistance. “We should not be providing the private information of our citizens to the federal government,” said Vermont’s junior senator. “We should be protecting the privacy of Vermont citizens.”
All together, Welch said Trump’s actions are part and parcel of an authoritarian push. He accused the president of employing a “dual standard” around crime in the nation’s capital. “You had a riot that was inspired and incited by President Trump and those folks who were intent on doing real violence and hurt many of these law enforcement officers have been pardoned by the president.” Welch was in Congress hiding from mobs of Trump supporters who rampaged through the Capitol on January 6, 2021.
Abroad, Sen. Welch was also sharply critical of Israel’s war in Gaza. Since the October 7, 2023 attack in which Hamas killed some 1,200 Israelis and took hostage some 250 soldiers and civilians, Israel has killed over 61,000 Palestinians, detained about 3,000 people — none of whom have been charged with a crime — and waged a campaign of starvation against a desperate population. In response, Welch has called for a ceasefire, the return of hostages, and a cutoff of sales of offensive weapons to Israel.
“Being against starvation is not at all being against the endurance of the democratic Jewish state of Israel. It’s about being against starvation and that starvation being inflicted by the authority of the state.” 
American democracy is “fragile,” Welch said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-13 20:56:07+00:00,CT Mirror,Republican Ryan Fazio opens campaign for governor,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/republican-ryan-fazio-opens-campaign-for-governor/,State Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich opened a campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination with a pledge to lower state income taxes.,"State Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich opened a campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination Wednesday with a dig at Connecticut’s popular Democratic governor and a pledge to lower state income taxes, cap local property taxes and reduce electric rates.
In a 90-second video, the 35-year-old Fazio targets the state’s high cost of living as a central issue and ties Gov. Ned Lamont, who has been hinting at a run for a third term in 2026, to a Democratic legislative majority that is more liberal than Lamont on fiscal, labor and housing issues. 
“Connecticut was once an affordable place where families could build a future, but after years of failed leadership in Hartford, it’s where dreams get buried under sky-high electric bills and taxes,” Fazio said. “Under Ned Lamont and his radical legislature, electric rates and taxes have soared to the third-highest in the country.”
Fazio is the second Republican to create a campaign committee that allows him to begin raising and spending money on a run for governor. The first was Jennifer Tooker, the first selectwoman of Westport. New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart has an exploratory committee and is expected to join them as declared candidates.
Republicans have not won a gubernatorial or congressional race in Connecticut since 2006, when the GOP’s brand still was embodied by President George W. Bush, and the party has suffered further losses in the General Assembly since President Donald Trump has come to dominate the party.
Each in their 30s, Fazio and Stewart will be vying to become the face of a new generation of Republicans who will need to appeal to Trump voters in a primary while maintaining a certain distance from a president who has lost decisively in Connecticut in each of his three runs for the White House. 
“I voted for the president. I have great respect for his service and patriotism,” Fazio said. “I know our race for governor will be decided by state issues and the ability to fight for state residents.”
Lamont, 71, is a former businessman, long-time Greenwich resident and one of Fazio’s constituents in the 36th Senate District. He is expected to finalize a decision on a third term after Labor Day.
Fazio drew national notice in August 2021 as the first Republican to flip a Democratic legislative seat after Joe Biden defeated Trump to win the White House.
Fazio won the seat in a special election after the resignation of Alex Kasser, a Democrat who unseated a Republican in 2018. Kasser was the first Democrat elected to the state Senate from Greenwich since the Great Depression, and her win was emblematic of the GOP’s waning fortunes in Fairfield County.
Fazio won a full term in 2022 with just 50.1% of the vote, and he was targeted by Democrats during the 2024 presidential year. But he outperformed Trump, whom he rarely if ever mentioned during this campaign, and was reelected with 52% of the vote. 
In the legislature, he has made electric rates his key issue as the ranking Senate Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee and contributed to the drafting and passage of a bipartisan energy bill that will result in a modest reduction in electric rates by shifting some expenses off ratepayers.
The measure authorized state bonding of $155 million to offset a portion of the public benefits charge in monthly bills. The charge is a levy on ratepayers for programs that, among other things, provide financial assistance for low-income customers and encourage energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives.
In his announcement video, Fazio made specific promises about lowering the cost of living in Connecticut.


“Let’s cut electric rates by 20% and eliminate the public benefits charge. Let’s reduce income taxes by $1,500 for the average family and cap property taxes,” Fazio said.
In an interview, Fazio said he believes property taxes can be capped without shifting local expenses to the state budget. One way, he said, would be to eliminate some of the unfunded mandates on municipalities. 
Choosing specific goals for electric rate and income tax cut was deliberate, he said.
“I’m running for very specific reasons and to do very specific things,” he said.
He acknowledged the governor’s reputation as a fiscal moderate poses a challenge for Republicans, but there is ample room to run to his right on the issues of affordability,
“There is not a corner of the state you can go to where you don’t hear concerns about electric bills, property taxes, the ability of young people to get a job and seniors to retire comfortably,” Fazio said. “It’s not just numbers on a page. It’s people’s lives. People have been hurting here for a long time.”
Fazio recently became engaged, and his fiancée, Amy Orser, is featured in the video. He was unsure how a wedding and a campaign would be coordinated.
“You don’t plan these things, and here you are,” he said. “These are both great things and exciting things.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ryan-Fazio-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 16:57:02.869670

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Underscoring what advocates see as worsening partisan divide over LGBTQ+ rights, Maine lawmakers voted mostly along party lines on many related bills this session, according to Equality Maine’s annual scorecard, released Tuesday.
The organization tracked how every lawmaker voted on specific legislation targeting transgender youth as well as broader proposals that would impact the LGBTQ+ community or that Equality Maine considers to align with their mission to create an inclusive, intersectional community to advance the rights of LGBTQ+ Mainers. These included bills that fund reproductive health and abortion services, a bill that would prevent children from being doxxed, bills related to public health and gun control, and a bill that sought to prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use.
“Most bills have a connection to our community in some form or fashion,” said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine, emphasizing the importance of tracking a wide range of legislation. According to the organization’s scorecard, most Democrats voted to preserve reproductive health, promote gun reform and reject anti-trans bills. 
Most Republicans voted in favor of the eight anti-trans bills introduced this session. These aimed to restrict the rights of students to participate in girls sports teams, access school bathrooms and locker rooms, and use pronouns aligning with their gender identity. Despite a handful of Democrats voting for some of those bills, none passed this session.
In particular, four democrats voted against LD 233, a bill restricting trans athletes’ rights, citing unfair advantages they believe trans girls have over their cis teammates: Reps. Stephan Bunker of Farmington, Wayne Farrin of Jefferson, Dani O’Halloran of Brewer and David Rollins of Augusta. Some of them also voted against their party on some gun control legislation, according to the Equality Maine tracker. 
On the Republican side, only Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford opposed these measures and during the floor debate gave an impassioned speech against several of those bills. He has since left the party to run for governor as an independent. 
The issue of trans rights in particular has become more political over the past few years, Drew noted. For months, Maine faced scrutiny by the Trump administration for its inclusive trans policies, which Drew said had existed for decades without objection or questioning.
“The national spotlight and some of the local issues related to being trans has really unfortunately polarized the parties,” she said.“Historically, LGBTQ+ rights had more bipartisan support.”
For example, when the Legislature added an amendment to the Maine Human Rights Act in 2005 that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, educational opportunity, credit and public accommodations, it passed with solid bipartisan support, as did a bill supporting marriage equality in 2009.
However, the Equality Maine scorecard did highlight new alignment on the issue of eminent domain. Sponsored by Republican House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor, LD 958, which aimed to preserve tribal rights to land, won over many Republicans who generally were less supportive of previous attempts to provide the Wabanaki Nations greater sovereignty.
Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, ultimately vetoed the bill, but Drew saw the effort as proof that the Legislature could again find common ground around LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights.
“I’d like to be hopeful that when I see that overlap there’s probably ways we can bridge those differences that remain across parties,” she said.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Roughly 8% of Rhode Island Senate District 4 voters cast ballots in the special Aug. 5 election, according to final results certified by the state Board of Elections Wednesday.
The board’s unanimous vote, made swiftly and without discussion, confirms the preliminary outcome of the election in which Democrat Stefano Famiglietti secured 83% of votes, compared with 16% for Republican Alexander Asermely.
The special election was triggered by the death of the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. Ruggerio held the seat for 40 years prior to his death in April.
Famiglietti, 33, a personal injury lawyer, pledged to follow in his predecessor’s footsteps, emphasizing deep community ties which include serving on the North Providence Town Council since 2018. His ascension to the State Senate triggers a special election for his seat on the town council, dates for which have not been set.
Famiglietti’s landslide victory received national party recognition, with Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin touting the results as Democrats’ second-biggest “overperformance” of 2025 compared with district results in the 2024 presidential election.
There are 22,214 registered voters in the district, which spans North Providence and a section of northern Providence. A majority of them, roughly 10,000, are registered Democrats, while another 9,700 are unaffiliated, with the remainder registered as Republicans, according to data from the Rhode Island Department of State. 
Nearly 60% of the 2,054 voters who participated in the August special election cast ballots on Election Day at one of the four designated polling places, Miguel Nunez, state election director, said during the Wednesday meeting. Another 25% voted early during designated hours at city or town halls, while the remainder submitted ballots by mail,
Famiglietti will be sworn into office at 4 p.m. Thursday in an inauguration ceremony at the Rhode Island State House. Secretary of State Gregg Amore will administer the oath of office.
Famiglietti will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, though 2026. State lawmakers are paid $20,391.97 a year.

Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. Some state legislators are pushing to protect child influencers (Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival).A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring adult account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
 40 million subscribers

Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”
This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

,DC,2025-08-13 20:33:51+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump in court ruling allowed to hold back foreign aid funds approved by Congress,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-court-ruling-allowed-hold-back-foreign-aid-funds-approved-congress,,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned a lower court’s ruling that had required the Trump administration to spend foreign aid dollars approved by Congress.But instead of addressing the central argument of the lawsuit — that a president cannot refuse to spend money approved by lawmakers, who hold the power of the purse — the Circuit Court in a potentially significant decision said the organizations that filed the case didn’t have the authority to do so.Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote in her 33-page opinion that only the comptroller general, who leads the Government Accountability Office, has the power to bring lawsuits when a president impounds, or refuses to spend, congressionally approved funds.  The GAO is an independent, non-partisan watchdog agency that works for Congress.“Because the grantees lack a cause of action, we need not address on the merits whether the government violated the Constitution by infringing on the Congress’s spending power through alleged violations of the 2024 Appropriations Act, the ICA and the Anti-Deficiency Act,” Henderson wrote. The ICA is the Impoundment Control Act, which is the legal mechanism through which the president can delay or withhold funds.Henderson was nominated to the Circuit Court in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, a few years after President Ronald Reagan nominated her as a federal district judge in 1986.Henderson wrote that she and Judge Gregory G. Katsas, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, concluded “the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction” for several reasons.Both Republican and Democratic state attorneys general filed amicus briefs in the case, with Republicans siding with the Trump administration. The case originated when Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day freezing certain foreign aid spending.Henderson wrote that “within weeks, the State Department and USAID suspended or terminated thousands of grant awards.”‘It is our responsibility to check the president’Judge Florence Y. Pan, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, issued a 46-page dissenting opinion, arguing the ruling from her two colleagues was “procedurally and substantively flawed.”“It is our responsibility to check the President when he violates the law and exceeds his constitutional authority,” Pan wrote. “We fail to do that here.”Pan wrote she disagreed with the majority’s opinion that Trump withholding certain foreign aid funding was “a mere violation of the Impoundment Control Act that should be addressed by the Comptroller General.”“In this case, the President’s violation of the Impoundment Control Act is a sideshow,” Pan wrote. “That statute provided a mechanism for the President to lawfully attempt to impound the funds, and his failure to follow its prescribed procedures is evidence that he was, in fact, refusing to obligate the funds in defiance of Congress.”Public media funding targetedThe Trump administration has used the Impoundment Control Act one time this year, when it requested Congress cancel $9.4 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs.The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the full request in mid-June.Senate Republicans approved the bill in July after preserving full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.House GOP lawmakers then cleared the bill for Trump’s signature just before a 45-day clock ran out.Trump administration sees 'big win'Several members of the Trump administration, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and Attorney General Pam Bondi, cheered the Circuit Court’s ruling in social media posts.“In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects,” Bondi wrote. “We will continue to successfully protect core Presidential authorities from judicial overreach.”Vought wrote the ruling was a “Big win!”An OMB spokesperson wrote in a statement the ruling represented a victory for the White House.“Radical left dark-money groups have been using the court system to seize control of U.S. foreign policy,” the spokesperson wrote. “Today’s decision stops these private groups from maliciously interfering with the President’s ability to spend responsibly and administer foreign aid in a lawful manner and in alignment with his America First policies.”Lauren Bateman, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group and lead counsel on the suit, wrote in a statement that the court's ruling represented ""a significant setback for the rule of law and risks further erosion of basic separation of powers principles.""We will seek further review from the court, and our lawsuit will continue regardless as we seek permanent relief from the Administration's unlawful termination of the vast majority of foreign assistance. In the meantime, countless people will suffer disease, starvation, and death from the Administration’s unconscionable decision to withhold life-saving aid from the world’s most vulnerable people.""",,,,2025-08-13 16:57:02.869670

Parks Elementary in Oklahoma City serve a student breakfast in the school cafeteria on Wednesday. Oklahoma City Public Schools offers all cafeteria meals for free, but other districts charge fees. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Multiple Oklahoma school districts say they will continue to charge cafeteria fees despite demands from the state’s public education chief to provide all meals for free.
Serving free meals to all students, as state Superintendent Ryan Walters called for last month, isn’t financially feasible and would require dramatic cost cuts, district officials have said. Unlike other states that made school meals universally free, Oklahoma has not dedicated any extra funds to support the policy.
“At the present time, we’re going to continue operating the way we have done with lunches until we have further guidance in terms of what and how that’s going to look within our school and other school districts,” said Josh Delich, superintendent of Edmond Public Schools.
Walters threatened to penalize and audit schools that don’t comply, calling cafeteria fees an extra tax unfairly imposed on Oklahoma families. 
“If schools districts cannot, and will not, prioritize students, (the Oklahoma State Department of Education) will get involved and audit their budgets,” Walters said in a statement Wednesday. “Record amounts of funding are going to schools and it is completely unacceptable for administrators to continue failing our kids, and get rich doing it.”
No state law permits the state superintendent to punish or audit schools for not providing universal free meals, according to a memo from the Oklahoma State School Boards Association.
Speaking with reporters after a State of the Schools event Aug. 6, Delich said he’s not concerned about blowback from the state Department of Education.

“As things continue to unfold, we’ll adjust accordingly and do what we need to do as a collective system to do what’s best for students and families,” he said.
Children living at or near the federal poverty line qualify for free or reduced-price meals in any public school. 
More than 250 districts in Oklahoma have a large enough portion of students from low-income homes that they receive enhanced federal funding that enables them to provide free meals to all enrolled.
Other districts with lower poverty levels don’t qualify for as much federal support for child nutrition costs, which is why they still charge for meals.
Some, like Norman Public Schools, have a mix of both scenarios.
Norman has 19 schools that offer free meals to all students and five that do not. Low-income families at those five schools are encouraged to fill out an application for free or reduced-price meals, district spokesperson Courtney Scott said.
With less than a week to go before Norman’s first day of school, the district had yet to receive any formal directive or guidance from the state Education Department about the meal policy, she said Thursday.  
“We aren’t changing any plans,” Scott said.
Representatives of Deer Creek Public Schools and Bixby Public Schools said they don’t intend to cancel all cafeteria fees, either. Superintendents of both districts said it would take “drastic” cuts to cover free meals for every student.
Walters urged districts to reduce administrative spending to free up funds for the extra cost.

Even a “crippling” 50% cut to Bixby’s administrative budget would afford only 30% of the cost of student meals, Superintendent Lydia Wilson wrote in a message to families.
Deer Creek Superintendent Jason Perez said his district would have to lay off teachers and cut school programs on top of firing all administrators.
“I think for now, we’re going to continue on as planned,” he told Oklahoma Voice on July 8. “We’ve got school opening up in a month. We want to make sure we’re fully staffed. We want to make sure that we’re going to be able to fund school.”
A Deer Creek assistant superintendent, Lenis DeRieux, said last week the district’s stance has not changed.
Lunches will cost $3.40 in Deer Creek’s elementary and middle schools, and $3.75 at its high school, according to the district’s website. Breakfast is $2.37.

(Photo courtesy of Maine AFL-CIO) Graduate workers gathered in Orono on Wednesday to ask the University of Maine administration to agree to a fair union contract. 
Members of the University of Maine Graduate Workers’ Union gathered outside the Raymond H. Fogler Library to speak out about the bargaining process for a contract that began in November 2023 — more than 630 days ago. Other labor union members from across the state joined them in solidarity. 
“Six hundred and thirty days. The graduate workers union has shown up to the table prepared to bargain and motivated to reach the first contract,” said Grant Provost, a member of Ironworkers Local 7 and vice president of the Maine AFL-CIO. “It’s time for the university system to do the same.”
“Every person in Maine benefits from the important work that graduate students do,” he added, including research that directly impacts Maine’s economy and industries such as forestry, wildlife, marine sciences and more.
UMaine grad students hoping to secure higher pay, more transparency in first contract

Union members from other industries including a paper worker, an ironworker and a nurse spoke out in support of finalizing a contract for the graduate workers. State Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), who co-chairs the Legislature’s Labor Committee, was also present. 
Erin Oberson, a labor and delivery nurse at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center and a member of the Maine State Nurses Association, said she has been supporting the graduate workers since they first formed their union. She explained that nurses are invested in the students’ efforts because they help teach some of the required courses for the UMaine nursing students.
“Shouldn’t we want to attract the best and the brightest graduate workers to teach our state’s future nursing workforce?” Oberson asked, which was responded to with applause. She said that isn’t possible if those workers aren’t paid living wages or provided decent health care. 
The university system said that it values the contributions of graduate workers but that it is  limited by the state and federal money it receives, according to a statement provided by Samantha Warren, chief external and governmental affairs officer. 
“As a public university system, our ability to improve work opportunities and conditions without shifting costs to our students and their families in the form of unreasonable tuition increases largely depends on our State appropriation and our federal grants and contracts, tens of millions of dollars of which have been impacted in recent months,” the statement reads. “We continue to bargain with the University of Maine Graduate Workers Union in good faith and are committed to achieving an agreement that is responsive to the requests of these respected student workers and the operational needs and increasingly constrained resources of our public institutions.”
The university also announced $250,000 in philanthropic funding back in May to support graduate students whose work had been jeopardized by the loss of federal research funding.
Peter Howe, a research assistant and PhD student in the School of Forest Resources at UMaine, said the union had its 51st all-day bargaining session with the university last week. 
“What we’re proposing is something in line with all our peer universities and what did they hand us back? More crumbs, more pay cuts,” Howe said. “We’re here to say that when we come back to the table on Friday, we need a fair contract and we need it now.”

The Delaware Judiciary is mourning the loss of retired Superior Court Judge John E. Babiarz, Jr., who died on July 30 at the age of 83.
Judge Babiarz served on the Delaware Superior Court for 25 years, from 1985 until his retirement in 2010.
Known for his sharp intellect, fairness, and warm demeanor, he was remembered by colleagues as a cornerstone of the state’s legal community.
“The Court is saddened by the loss of Judge Babiarz,” said Superior Court President Judge Eric M. Davis. “John was intelligent, quick witted, kind and generous. A larger-than-life presence on the Court for many years and a great colleague. He will be dearly missed.”
READ: David J. Pacific named president, CEO of The Music School of Delaware
A Delaware native and graduate of Salesianum High School, Babiarz earned his law degree from Harvard Law School and joined the Delaware Bar in 1966.
Prior to his judicial appointment, he practiced law for nearly two decades, co-founding the firm Biondi and Babiarz in 1971 and later becoming a partner at Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell in 1979.
He earned respect on the bench for his fiercely independent approach to the law, often described as even-handed and principled, without leaning toward either prosecution or defense.
Babiarz was also deeply connected to Wilmington’s civic legacy.
His father, John Babiarz Sr., served as mayor of Wilmington, and Judge Babiarz spent most of his judicial career in the same Rodney Square courthouse where his father once had an office.
Reflecting on his time on the bench, Babiarz once said, “I can’t wait for tomorrow to come, “and in 2010, days before his retirement, he
remained equally enthusiastic. “I look forward to coming to work every day,” he said.
Judge Babiarz is survived by his wife of 58 years, Linda C. (Whalen) Babiarz; daughters Lisa Loughran of Petaluma, Calif.; Julia Babiarz of Truckee, Calif.; and Amanda Cline and her husband Matthew of Brisbane, Calif.; as well as several grandchildren.

“For too long, dark money has operated in the shadows of Lansing with little accountability,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement Wednesday. “The Unlock Michigan investigation shed light on corruption in campaign finance that was long considered common practice.

Baxter was accused of lying to investigators about the extent of her fundraising efforts for the fund, with the Department of Attorney General alleging she was given an opportunity to correct her statements under oath, and chose not to. 
Baxter was charged alongside Heather Lombardini, the head of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility – also tied to Shirkey – and treasurer for the Michigan! My Michigan! fund.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Self-driving cars aren’t here yet, but states are getting the rules ready

Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

In communities across the Commonwealth, these stations have kept the lights on in meeting halls and school auditoriums, ensuring that local democracy happens in the open.
The post Don’t let public access TV go dark  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN CITIES AND towns across Massachusetts, a quiet but vital institution continues to serve as a local watchdog, a storytelling hub, and an incubator for the next generation of media makers: public access television. Viewed by some as a relic of the cable era, these local channels are now more important than ever, precisely because so many other local news outlets have vanished. 
Yet this vital public service is under threat. As more households “cut the cord,” shifting from cable TV to streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube TV, the cable franchise fees that sustain local access operations have been steadily shrinking. Stations that once operated on healthy budgets now face layoffs, reduced programming, or outright closure. Without intervention, entire communities could lose their only local media outlet. 
In communities across the Commonwealth, these stations have kept the lights on in meeting halls and school auditoriums, ensuring that local democracy happens in the open, where residents can see for themselves how their tax dollars are spent and decisions are made. When the COVID pandemic hit, it was these Public, Educational, and Government (PEG) access stations that pivoted to hybrid meetings, ensuring that residents could still participate in local government even if they couldn’t leave their homes. 
But these stations do far more than record government meetings. They are often the last remaining local media outlet that covers community events and tells stories that bigger broadcasters overlook. 
Many have stepped up their game in recent years, adding original news programming to keep residents informed about issues that directly affect their neighborhoods. Others have started holding workshops on emerging technology like AI, providing citizens with the opportunity to stay up to date on the latest advances in technology and how it impacts them. 
Equally important, public access centers provide hands-on opportunities for people of all ages to learn about video production, editing, and broadcasting. Volunteers produce shows on local history, culture, and politics. High school students get real-world training that can lead to careers in media and communications. 
I personally know the value these opportunities provide, having started my career in media as a volunteer for Holbrook’s cable access station covering high school sports. Without the opportunities presented to me by public access media, I might never have discovered my passion for digital media, and I know many other students have had similar experiences.  
That is why the Massachusetts Legislature must act now by passing An Act to Modernize Funding for Community Media Programming (S.41 and H.91). This legislation recognizes a simple truth: streaming companies use the same public rights-of-way, such as streets, utility poles, and internet infrastructure, that traditional cable companies use, but they pay nothing back to the communities they do business in. 
This bill would require streaming entertainment operators earning more than $250,000 a year in Massachusetts to pay an assessment, similar in spirit to the franchise fees paid by cable providers, to support PEG access channels. The law would establish a fair and transparent system to ensure that community media centers receive the funding they need to serve their communities. 
Updating PEG funding isn’t about punishing innovation or clinging to the past. It’s about making sure that communities don’t lose the tools they need to stay informed and connected. It’s about fairness: when companies profit from infrastructure that taxpayers built and maintain, they should help sustain the local services that keep our towns and cities connected and informed. 
Massachusetts has long prided itself on being a leader in civic engagement. Passing this legislation would continue that legacy, modernizing how we fund community media so it can thrive alongside streaming giants in the digital age.

Patrick Morrisey is ramping up the state’s participation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), announcing a wide-spread agreement that enlists the National Guard and police officers to expand immigration enforcement operations in West Virginia.
It’s one of the most wide-ranging agreements a state has forged with ICE under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. It allows designated law enforcement officers to interrogate people on their immigration status during routine police duties.
Morrisey said that unauthorized immigration was linked to the state’s fentanyl issues. More than 81% of fatal drug overdoses in West Virginia in 2023 involved fentanyl.
West Virginia — which is nearly 1,500 miles away from the U.S. southern border —  has effectively become a border state, the governor said. 
“We had to wrestle with the consequences of seemingly unlimited amounts of fentanyl flooding into our state,” Morrisey said Wednesday at a press conference in Parkersburg. 
Morrisey has directed the West Virginia National Guard, the West Virginia State Police and the state Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation to participate in the federal 287(g) program that enables designated local officers to perform certain immigration functions under ICE’s oversight. Local law enforcement can participate in the program, as well. 
ICE has signed similar agreements with hundreds of local and state agencies across the country.
“The goal is to get as many of our personnel trained in order to be effective partners with ICE Homeland Security and the Trump administration,” Morrisey said. 
The National Guard and law enforcement will participate in the “task force model” of the 287(g) program, the broadest of the program’s models that permits law enforcement to enforce immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties.
The task force agreements with ICE were discontinued in 2012 during the Obama administration after a 2011 Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination against Latinos in an Arizona task force, Stateline reported. 
In West Virginia, participating state police and National Guard members will also have the authority to make warrantless arrests of any undocumented immigrant entering or attempting to unlawfully enter the United States in the officer’s presence or view or if the officer believes the person to be arrested is in violation of the law and likely to escape.
“We are very excited about complete cooperation and collaboration with ICE,” said Superintendent of State Police James L. Mitchell. “We hope that this sends a message to people throughout West Virginia that if you’re illegal, if you’re committing crimes that are not welcomed here in this state.”
Morrisey said only participating law enforcement personnel who are nominated and trained will have the authority to conduct the delegated immigration officer functions. 
“The National Guard stands by ready to assist where we can with the ICE mission,” said Maj. Gen. Jim Seward, adjutant general of West Virginia. “We briefed the governor that we have 175 certified law enforcement officers that will be going through this training to assist ICE where they are needed.”
DCR will also play a role in the program by servicing and executive administrative warrants for undocumented immigrants who currently are in state correctional facilities. 
David Kelly, DCR commissioner, said it would reduce the premature release of potentially dangerous individuals into communities. “It’s about being smart, efficient and proactive,” he said.  
Around 2% of West Virginia’s residents are immigrants.
In January, Morrisey signed an executive order directing the state Department of Homeland Security, law enforcement and more to coordinate with ICE and to support Trump’s policies on illegal immigration. 
As of Wednesday, the governor said there were 88 undocumented immigrants in state custody. Of that total, 46 are being detained on immigration charges that included failing to appear in court before a deportation judge, Morrisey said.

(Photo via FWC)Bear hunts in Florida will resume following a unanimous vote Wednesday by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Following a preliminary approval in May, commissioners took final action during a meeting in Havana, in Gadsden County, Wednesday that was heavily attended by opponents and hunters hopeful for a hunt.
The first hunt will be 23 days long during December, making it the first since 2015.
FWC commissioners appear poised to affirm the first bear hunt in Florida in a decade

The commission aims to “manage the bear population through a conservative, well-regulated bear hunt,” according to a summary on the day’s agenda.
Regulations include designated bear hunting zones, permits given through a lottery system, and a cap on permits issued by the executive director of the commission. The new rules allow hunters to shoot bears at feeding stations and in 2027 will allow the use of dogs in bear hunting. 
The prospect of a hunt drew widespread public comment, the state reporting more than 10,000 responses. During the meeting Wednesday, hundreds showed up.
Critics have called it a trophy hunt and cruel to the animals, particularly mother bears, while advocates for the hunt said it would reduce human interactions with the animals, making communities safer. 
Permits for Florida residents, if selected, would be $100, and $300 for nonresidents. The state is limiting out-of-state permits to 10% of the total granted. 
The bear population in Florida is estimated at around 4,050 — but the agency came up with that estimate as long ago as 2015, the last time a bear hunt took place. 
That hunt ended abruptly after only two days after nearly 300 bears were killed.
In a FWC-conducted survey, 75% of more than 13,000 self-selected participants opposed the proposal, with just 23% in support. A Remington Research survey commissioned by the Humane World for Animals showed that 81% of Florida residents oppose the reopening of bear-hunting season.
Of the 40 states with black bear populations, 34 have regulated bear hunting seasons, according to the FWC.

The Music School of Delaware has announced the appointment of David J. Pacific as its next President and CEO, following a national search.
He will officially begin his tenure on October 20, 2025.
Pacific, a nationally recognized arts executive and classically trained pianist, brings more than a decade of experience in nonprofit arts leadership, education, and community engagement.
His appointment signals a new chapter for the 100-year-old institution, which serves thousands of music students and audiences across the region.
“There is something truly extraordinary happening at The Music School of Delaware, and it resonates across the entire state,” Pacific said. “To join this community of exceptional music educators, dedicated leaders, and remarkable students as the school’s next President and CEO is an incredible honor—one that has me inspired and overjoyed by the people who are at the heart of what makes the school exceptional.”

Pacific most recently served as the inaugural Executive Director of the Joseph Avenue Arts and Culture Alliance in Rochester, N.Y., where he led the organization through a period of rapid growth and expanded access to free, high-quality arts programming.
His past roles also include leadership positions with the Southeastern Piano Festival in Columbia, S.C., Steinway and Sons in New York, and Friends of Chamber Music in Kansas City, Mo.
“I am grateful to build on the rich history of The Music School of Delaware as we welcome its next century and invite more people to join us in making music a meaningful part of our lives together,” he said.
Elizabeth Stout, Chair of the school’s CEO Search Committee, said Pacific stood out among candidates for his executive leadership, fundraising acumen, and alignment with the school’s mission.
“Our search focused on identifying a leader who embodies three key qualities: exceptional executive leadership experience in a nonprofit setting, a proven track record in high-volume fundraising, and a deep commitment to embodying the mission of the Music School of Delaware,” she said. “David not only meets, but exceeds all of these criteria. His understanding of and respect for our faculty and staff, his success in building inclusive and accessible arts programs, and his enthusiasm for community engagement make him the right leader for this moment in our school’s evolution.”
Pacific holds degrees in piano performance and pedagogy from Nazareth University and the University of South Carolina.
A longtime music educator, he has taught and mentored students at community music schools across the country and has been recognized for excellence in both piano performance and choral conducting.
In a message to faculty and staff, Pacific emphasized collaboration and community.
“Whether through the commitment of the board, the extraordinary talents of the faculty and staff, or the deep engagement of students and families, it is clear that The Music School of Delaware is much more than a statewide institution—it is a vital, living community devoted to the transformative power of music and music education,” he wrote. “I look forward to listening, learning, and collaborating with all of you to shape a shared vision that strengthens and expands the school’s reach, deepens our impact, and lifts up every member of our community.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/music-jpg.jpg,,,2025-08-13 16:57:02.869670

Andy Beshear said more than 1,900 driver's licensing credentials had been revoked by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet because of irregularities. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer) Kentucky’s Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman say investigators have been looking into a whistleblower’s allegations that immigrants paid temporary contract workers to illegally obtain state driver’s licenses. 
Louisville TV station WDRB reported Monday a former clerk at a Kentucky driver’s licensing office said co-workers sold, for $200 each, state driver’s licenses to immigrants who couldn’t legally obtain them because they are in the country without permission. The whistleblower, Melissa Moorman, worked at Louisville’s Nia licensing office through the staffing agency Quantam Solutions. 
Moorman told the TV station she was fired when she reported the scheme to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). She filed a lawsuit against the cabinet and Quantum Solutions in April. 
Beshear in a Wednesday press conference told reporters the cabinet regularly reviews driver’s licensing credential applications and had revoked 1,985 credentials for irregularities. 
“KYTC immediately contacted law enforcement who are engaged in a criminal investigation, and it includes multiple offices that are both state and federal,” Beshear said. “The revoked credentials, if used, would not work at an airport, would be flagged if pulled over at a traffic stop. We are committed to getting all of the facts and holding anybody who violated the law accountable.”
Beshear said all employees involved had been hired through a “temp agency and have been terminated.” When asked if Moorman was fired by the staffing agency Quantam Solutions or the cabinet after reporting the scheme, Beshear said he didn’t have that information and had not read the whistleblower lawsuit complaint. But he also said some statements in the complaint were “not factual.” 
Coleman, the Republican attorney general, at a roundtable with law enforcement in Shepherdsville on Wednesday said his office had been collaborating with Kentucky State Police and federal officials “for some time now on that investigation.” 
“The conduct as shared by the whistleblower, has been very concerning that the media has reported on in the last few days,” Coleman said. “It’s a several months-long investigation. It’s been ongoing since long before the media reports of the last couple of days. So that is a very ongoing, very robust investigation at present.”

The report of the whistleblower lawsuit has sparked calls from Republicans in the state legislature and Republican Auditor Allison Ball for investigations into the whistleblower’s allegations. 
“If these reports are accurate, this is fundamentally wrong on every level. It’s not just a breakdown in oversight but a betrayal of public trust,” said Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, in a statement on the allegations. “The Kentucky General Assembly will raise concerns and take every action within our authority to correct this wrong and ensure it never happens again.” 
Higdon, the chair of the Kentucky Senate Transportation Committee, in his statement referenced previous frustrations Kentuckians have had at regional driver’s licensing offices, which the state legislature established through a law passed in 2020. Previously, circuit court clerks in each county issued driver’s licenses. The 2020 law, signed by Beshear, garnered support and opposition from both parties in the state legislature.
Kentuckians have faced long lines at the offices, and another state law went into effect this year requiring drivers to pass a vision test to renew their licenses. 
Ball, the Republican state auditor, sent a letter Wednesday to Beshear and Kentucky Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray requesting a formal explanation regarding the allegations, saying she was troubled by reports of an “alleged black market within the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet.” 
Beshear, responding to a question from a reporter about if undocumented immigrants were receiving fraudulent driver’s licenses, said that it was a part of the investigation. 
“There are a number of different reasons people might try to get fake identification, and I want to make sure I don’t get in front of the Kentucky State Police in their current investigation,” Beshear said. “But when that’s complete, we look forward to sharing any and all of those facts.”

(Brooke Thorington/WRKF)PLAQUEMINE – It’s planting season for sugarcane farmers in Louisiana as they replenish fields that are older than three years and no longer yielding as much sugar.
When President Donald Trump said he wanted Coca-Cola to use sugarcane in its signature drink, instead of high-fructose corn syrup, it brought a lot of attention to the industry.
Patrick Frischhertz is the son-in-law of an eighth generation sugarcane farmer. He’s been in the business for close to 16 years, and he oversees St. Louis Planting in Plaquemine. The company farms sugarcane and soybeans. When Trump boasted he’d convinced Coca-Cola to use natural sugar, Frischhertz said it was welcome news.
“It seems to be getting everybody talking about sugar cane in Louisiana and our natural product. And as farmers we’re really appreciative of it,” Frischhertz.
Israel Huerta is originally from Mexico, and he’s been a U.S. citizen since 2013. He’s worked on the farm in Plaquemine for even longer. He admits he’s biased when it comes to comparing the high-fructose corn syrup in Coca-Cola to the one made with sugarcane.
“Actually, I think in Mexico they use that already. They use sugarcane and it tastes better. And it’s, it is more, uh, it’s not, I’m not, I’m not gonna say healthy, but it’s better, you know? Yeah. It’s better,” Huerta said.

According to the USDA, Florida produces the most sugarcane in the country–more than 17 million tons annually, followed by Louisiana, which produces 13.8 million tons.
So if there is an increase in demand, farmers here are likely to see it. Frischhertz was asked if he’s noticed this.
“ No, no. Our farm has not heard anything from any distributors or beverage manufacturers about trying to increase sugar, by any means,” he said. “For us, it’s business as usual and working hard out in the field to produce the best crop that we possibly can.”
Coca-Cola has stated they plan to release a line of their signature beverage sweetened with sugarcane in the U.S. this fall.
In the meantime, Frischhertz said he’ll watch and wait, see if the demand for sugarcane in soft drinks increases, and plant accordingly.

Kevin Corbin after a Senate committee meeting. (Photo: Lynn Bonner)The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services will slash Medicaid spending by $319 million effective October 1, Secretary Dev Sangvai wrote in a letter to General Assembly leaders Monday.
That reduction — coming in response to a shortfall in the state budget and changes to Medicaid policy in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — means the state will reduce rates by 3% to all medical providers, as well as cuts of 8-10% for inpatient and residential services and 10% for behavioral therapy and analysis for patients with autism.
In the letter obtained by NC Newsline, Sangvai wrote that while NCDHHS requested $819 million for the 2025-26 Medicaid rebase — the state’s calculation of required costs for the Medicaid program, accounting for growth in enrollment, increases in drug prices, and other factors — it was appropriated just $500 million for those purposes, requiring widespread reductions.
“To meet an effective date of October 1, we must begin several administrative steps now, including notifying providers and beneficiaries, updating contracts and systems, and informing our federal partners at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),” Sangvai wrote. “We have attempted to make these cuts reversible in the event that additional funding is approved. Absent additional appropriations by the General Assembly, however, NCDHHS will proceed with the reductions described herein.”
As part of a stopgap budget signed by Governor Josh Stein on Aug. 6, the General Assembly appropriated $600 million for Medicaid, $500 million of which will go to the rebase and $82 million of which will go to the Medicaid Managed Care Oversight Fund, which Sangvai wrote still has a $33 million deficit. The remaining $18 million will make up for what he called a “missing LME/MCO transfer,” referring to the Local Management Entity/Managed Care Organizations that manage some Medicaid services.
The letter also outlines plans to entirely cease optional coverage for GLP-1s, drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy commonly prescribed for weight loss. GLP-1s will continue to be covered when prescribed for other health issues such as diabetes and heart disease. NCDHHS will also pull funding for the Integrated Care for Kids Pilot, which will end ahead of schedule, a spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement.
Sangvai also indicated administrative cuts ahead, including ending or reducing contracts, letting temporary employees go, and ending some quality control and compliance functions. “These cuts will significantly impair NC Medicaid’s ability to be responsive to emerging needs and inquiries, monitor services for quality and compliance, and continue making timely operational improvements,” he wrote.
“Despite careful efforts to minimize harm, the reductions now required carry serious and far-reaching consequences. Most immediately, reduced rates and the elimination of services could drive providers out of the Medicaid program, threatening access to care for those who need it most,” Sangvai wrote. “NCDHHS remains hopeful that additional appropriations can be made to prevent these reductions.”
In a statement to NC Newsline, NCDHHS spokesperson Summer Tonizzo wrote that the appropriation shortfall “will result in cuts to services and reductions to provider rates to stay within budget.”
“All Medicaid providers will face a minimum 3% reduction in reimbursement rates, with some services — including physicians, hospice care, behavioral health long-term care, and nursing home services — seeing steeper cuts of 8% and 10%,” Tonizzo wrote. “These reductions may cause some providers to stop accepting Medicaid patients, as the lowered rates could make it financially unsustainable to continue offering care.”
“NCDHHS has attempted to make these cuts reversible in the event that additional funding is approved,” Tonizzo added.
This story will be updated.

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department on Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA – Noting that the Republican primary race for governor is still more than a year away, Gov. Ron DeSantis hesitated to say anything too definitive about the contest to succeed him on Wednesday.
But he did acknowledge that new Lt. Gov. Jay Collins definitely has “the ingredients” to be “a compelling candidate that can grab attention.”
The governor and his newly minted No. 2 in state government made their second appearance in Tampa in as many days on Wednesday, this time holding a press conference at the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Department, where DeSantis hand-delivered $5,000 recruitment bonus checks to more than three dozen Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies.
After months of speculation, DeSantis on Tuesday formally appointed Collins, a Hillsborough County state senator and retired Army Green Beret, to succeed Jeanette Nuñez as lieutenant governor for the remainder of his second term in office.
However, DeSantis and Collins chose not to answer questions Tuesday. During the question-and-answer session Wednesday, the Phoenix asked the governor if, based on his effusive public praise for Collins over the past 24 hours, he could support him if he runs for governor against Southwest Florida U.S. Rep.Byron Donalds, the early front-runner for the nomination.
DeSantis played down the horse race, saying that there is more a year before the GOP primary, “a lifetime in politics.” But he reiterated that he had confidence Collins could serve as governor “and do it well.”
Tuesday afternoon, DeSantis posted a campaign-style video of Collins produced by a political committee chaired by the new lieutenant governor. During Wednesday’s press conference, the governor said people who previously didn’t know anything about Collins until the previous day or saw the video “were really blown away by his story.”
“I think there’s a lot of people who are like, ‘Man, think this is the type of guy that we need,’” DeSantis said.
“We put out a video to just kind of introduce him to people, and people were like, ‘Man, that’s our guy.” So, he definitely has the ingredients of what it would take to be a compelling candidate that can grab attention, but I know that he’s really interested in moving the ball forward on all of these policies.”
For political observers, it’s been evident for months that DeSantis is interested in backing another Republican to challenge Donalds, who has already been endorsed by Donald Trump and has raised more than $22 million so far for his 2026 gubernatorial campaign.
It was previously believed that alternative candidate could be First Lady Casey DeSantis, who attended Tuesday’s press conference introducing Collins but did not speak publicly.
What about Casey DeSantis?
A reporter asked the governor if his selection of Collins for lieutenant governor and enthusiastic public support for him means Casey DeSantis is no longer considering a candidacy for governor. DeSantis insisted that any focus on the First Lady for the race was coming from outside forces, and not from her.
“I think from the beginning until now it’s always been a lot of people are like, ‘Can you get her to do it? Can you get her to do it?’ kind of deal. She just wants the state to do well,” he said.
“She was really excited and inspired with what we saw yesterday, when Jay was announced, so she’s going to be serving, continuing to help make a difference one way or another,” he said. “The thought around her has been more exterior with people telling her that she has to do all of those things.”

Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.

‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.

State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.

Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”

Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.

A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.

A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Natalie Behring/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Expecting challenges, blue states vow to create ‘firewall’ of abortion protections

Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

A press release from UM Health-Sparrow states that analyzing the results on-site will provide for shorter turnaround times, which allows patients to be treated in a more timely manner, helping to reduce further spread. The health system calls the advancement the latest installment in a “longstanding legacy of innovation.”
Similar to the COVID-19 and flu tests, the measles test is conducted via nasal swab and is ordered by a physician. Testing is available for inpatients in the hospital or outpatients in their vehicles.
The advancement comes as measles cases across the country are at their highest level in three decades. Eight months into the year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 1,319 confirmed cases of measles nationwide– a significant increase from 285 cases over the entirety of 2024. Michigan is among the 40 states to have reported measles cases. 
27 measles cases have been reported across nine Michigan counties this year, with three counties experiencing outbreaks that have impacted four or more people.
Per the  Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Measles Dashboard, there are currently no measles cases that are being actively monitored. However, as UM Health-Sparrow laboratories director Jon Baker noted, “measles is not going to go away and we’re going to see future outbreaks.”
This innovative testing, he added, “was part of making sure that we were prepared for that.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Ilona Biliaze refreshed a government website on her phone in late July, checking for updates on her immigration case again and again.
Biliaze, her husband and two teenage children are displaced Ukrainians living in Watertown under a temporary legal status known as humanitarian parole after they fled the Russian invasion in 2022. She watched as the updates changed: Their decision was a month away. Then it was three weeks, then two months, then three months.
Watching the time grow was defeating, after she’d done everything she could think of to keep her family in their home. They were denied asylum, another temporary legal status; they shared their story to local news outlets and on social media; they tried reaching out to their congressional delegates. Their parole status was scheduled to expire Aug. 17. 
‘This is our home’: Ukrainians settled in SD fear they’ll be forced to leave

She applied for the parole extension in June, and the office of U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, helped the family seek an expedited extension after they called his office in July. But the wait time on a decision kept increasing.
“I felt so bad,” Biliaze said. “It was too long, too late.”
Then, on July 28, it changed: Case approved.
She called her husband and sponsor family to share the news. Her sponsor, Susan Buhler, started crying on the phone, relieved her adopted family could stay. They shared hugs in the Biliazes’ driveway and marveled over the phone screen. The official documents arrived in the mail last week.
The two parents and their teenage children can live and work in the United States through August 2027. Their 10-month-old son is an American citizen, because he was born in Watertown.
“We feel safe here. This is our home,” Biliaze said.
The Biliazes are among 117,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States through Uniting for Ukraine (U4U). The humanitarian parole program is carried out under the U.S. Homeland Security secretary’s authority to allow noncitizens into the country with a sponsor on a temporary, case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons.

Johnson told South Dakota Searchlight his office was able to help by walking the Biliazes through the paperwork and flagging it for federal workers to understand its urgency.
“Most South Dakotans understand how important it is that when people are here legally, fleeing terrible, dangerous situations, that we have legal mechanisms to remain until they can safely return home,” Johnson said.
Johnson’s office has worked on 535 constituent cases so far this year, ranging from the Biliazes’ immigration case to helping other South Dakotans navigate the Interval Revenue Service, Social Security and Veterans Affairs. Fifty-three cases involved the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
South Dakota’s lone U.S. representative said that many Americans believe their congressional delegates only engage in political work, but constituent casework is where “nonpartisanship still reigns.” 
“That’s our job: We’re supposed to advocate for South Dakotans, and that’s what we do,” Johnson said.
The Biliazes hope to make South Dakota their home permanently and plan to apply for green cards, realizing how fast two years pass by. Congress has not offered a special pathway to legal permanent residency specifically for Ukrainian parolees, like the one for Cubans.
Johnson said opening up a citizenship pathway for families like the Biliazes or those on other temporary visa programs would be politically difficult, but possible.
“When the southern border was in crisis, there was a limited appetite in Washington to talk about more legal pathways to residency in America,” Johnson said. “Now that we’ve regained operational control, there’s more of an opportunity to have those conversations.”

Patrick Morrisey’s executive order and a Raleigh County court’s ruling upholding religious exemptions.  
Hardesty said the board’s conflict with Morrisey’s order would be resolved in court, but the board stopped short of voting to appeal Judge Michael Froble’s ruling last month that three plaintiffs in a lawsuit be preliminarily allowed to attend class there with a religious exemption.
“We’re not going to comply with an executive order that’s in conflict with the 1937 law,” he said. “We can’t do that. We’ve been advised by our counsel not to do that. I don’t want you to think for a minute we’re trying to inconvenience the people of West Virginia. We’re just trying to do our job.”
Hardesty said he takes offense to Morrisey’s characterization of the board as unelected bureaucrats, a comment Morrisey made during a June press conference. 
Taking a jab at Morrisey, Hardesty called on schools in every county in the state to teach a unit on the three branches of government.
“There’s a checks and balances system in our government,” Hardesty said. “There’s three branches of government. They perform three different functions. I hate it for the people of West Virginia that this issue is not decided before school started. I wish it was, but I don’t control the schedule or the time frame of the judiciary. It takes time. This issue will be decided in the proper venue by the proper people, and we’ll get a decision one way or the other, up or down, and we will comply with that decision.”
In a filing Tuesday, Froble scheduled a hearing for a permanent injunction in the lawsuit for Sept. 10 and 11, beginning at 9 a.m. both days. 
West Virginia school start dates vary by county, but at least three school districts started the new school year on Wednesday. 
The school board also voted to have its attorney send a letter to the state’s charter school board to ensure that it’s in compliance with state law and not accepting religious exemptions for school required vaccinations. The West Virginia Professional Charter Schools Board earlier this month voted that executive director James Paul should communicate to the state’s seven charter schools that they should accept religious vaccination waivers obtained through the state health department.
Morrisey issued the executive order on his second day in office in January. The order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, which prohibits government action that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion.
Morrisey argues that the state’s vaccine laws taken together with the 2023 law require the state to allow religious exemptions. 
West Virginia has been one of only five states in the country that do not allow students to skip the shots based on their religious beliefs about them. State law allows only medical exemptions. The Legislature earlier this year voted down Senate Bill 460, which would have set the religious exemptions into state code. 
The school board earlier this year voted to direct county boards of education not to comply with Morrisey’s order allowing religious exemptions.
In a statement posted to the social media platform X on Wednesday, Morrisey promised that families who want religious exemptions would ultimately win, either in court or through legislative action. 
“Hold strong,” Morrisey said. “I recognize that the Board [of education] is creating hardships for families but we will keep pushing.  
“Religious freedom is a cornerstone of our constitutional system and required under state law — we will eventually defeat this politically unaccountable board,” he said. “Nine year board terms are too long and need to be reconsidered.”

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)As Texas Republicans redraw the state’s congressional map to their advantage and prompt other states to consider rare mid-decade redistricting attempts, two Coloradans want the governor to have emergency authority to alter Colorado’s districts to restore partisan balance in Congress.
Legislative Council Staff received an initiative filing about emergency congressional redistricting on Monday, filed by Brandon Cary and Jorge Rodriguez. The proposed constitutional amendment, which would be on the 2026 ballot if it clears the procedural gauntlet of approval, would allow the governor to suspend the state’s independent redistricting commission and appoint a temporary body to redraw congressional districts to respond to any “national redistricting imbalances.”
“Texas is taking direct orders from the (U.S Department of Justice) and the current White House administration to do this redistricting,” Cary, who lives in Wheat Ridge, wrote in an email to Colorado Newsline. “Other states can counterbalance their efforts, and in the event nothing goes farther, legislation like what we are putting forth will only be a tool of preparedness that will hopefully not have to be used.”

Texas Republicans began supporting the idea of new political boundaries in July after President Donald Trump pushed state lawmakers to tweak districts to pick up more GOP seats in Congress. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott put redistricting on a special session agenda that also includes relief for recent floods, and the state Senate approved new congressional lines on Tuesday. Texas House Democrats left the state to deny that chamber a quorum to also approve the maps.
The move has prompted leaders in other states, including Democratic-led California, with its 52 districts, to push for redistricting to offset the Republican advantage created in Texas.
Typically, states redistrict every 10 years using fresh census data.










Trigger laws have use in our federalized system, and this law will coexist with Colorado's independent redistricting panel in an emergency capacity to be used sparingly and only when necessary in response to overreach from other states.


– Brandon Cary, proponent of redistricting amendment


The proposed law in Colorado would be triggered if “substantial evidence exists that one or more states have enacted congressional redistricting plans that result in severe partisan imbalance,” according to the initiative text. The governor could declare emergency authority or a majority of the Legislature could enact it.
“Trigger laws have use in our federalized system, and this law will coexist with Colorado’s independent redistricting panel in an emergency capacity to be used sparingly and only when necessary in response to overreach from other states,” Cary wrote.
Colorado’s independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions — one for congressional districts, one for state legislative districts — were formed by two constitutional amendments in 2018. They drew their first maps in 2021. Seven other states have independent commissions. The majority of states empower their Legislature, and therefore the political party in charge, to draw and approve maps.
Colorado currently has four U.S. House districts represented by Democrats and four represented by Republicans.
The idea for the initiative grew from an informal Reddit chat thread, Cary and Rodriguez said, and there is now a group chat of supporters.
“The amount of interest and encouragement we’ve gotten, even without much formal political or organizing experience, is honestly astounding. We know this is going to be a long process,” Rodriguez, who lives in Loveland, said.
The two said they have not connected with any state lawmakers about about running a bill to refer the measure to next year’s ballot, an alternative method of proposing the amendment to voters.
The initiative has a review and comment hearing from legislative staff later this month. Then, it will head to the state’s Title Board to be considered for a title. Backers would then need to get approved for a petition and gather about 125,000 signatures, from at least 2% of registered voters in each of the state’s 35 state Senate districts, to land on the ballot. Constitutional amendments then need 55% approval to pass.

(Andy Bosselman for Newsline)State regulators in Colorado have chosen 142 older, low-producing oil and gas wells to be permanently plugged, funded by well operator fees and federal grant money. The voluntary well plugging program is part of the state’s effort to reduce methane emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change.
These low-producing wells, called marginal wells, emit disproportionately high amounts of methane compared to their oil and gas production rates. Marginal wells are also at a high risk of becoming so-called orphan wells, wells that become wards of the state after they are abandoned by extraction companies.
“Plugging wells and preventing orphan wells is an important way to reduce pollution, improve Colorado’s air quality and make communities safer,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “Improving air quality helps keep Coloradans and our communities active and healthy, strengthening our high quality of life. Plugging these wells will directly help lower emissions and reduce risks.”

Funding to plug the wells comes from two pots: the federal Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which was established by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and awarded $12.6 million to Colorado, and the state Orphan Wells Mitigation Enterprise, which collects about $5 million in fees annually from well operators.
The state estimates that plugging the 142 wells will cost up to about $14 million. No state taxpayer money is used for the program.
There are far more marginal wells than those set to be plugged. In Colorado, 922 wells meet state plugging grant eligibility requirements and 8,566 wells meet federal plugging grant eligibility requirements. There are approximately 47,000 oil and gas wells in Colorado.











If these wells are running dry, they should be plugged, rather than keep letting them spew pollution ... It’s important for our communities.


– Heidi Leathwood, a climate policy analyst at the environmental nonprofit 350 Colorado


Heidi Leathwood, a climate policy analyst at the environmental nonprofit 350 Colorado, called for continued and expanded operator fees at the state level to plug marginal wells.
“If these wells are running dry, they should be plugged, rather than keep letting them spew pollution,” Leathwood said. “It’s important for our communities.”
Beyond the contributions to climate change from oil and gas extraction, Leathwood also shared her concerns about health problems, including cancers, heart problems and birth defects, that studies have shown can arise in communities near wells.
“We need to start preparing, and not even for what’s coming in the future, but for the wells that we have right now that need plugging, and we just don’t have enough money set aside,” she said.
The oil and gas industry accounts for 60% of Colorado’s methane emissions, according to a 2024 state report.
The 142 wells were chosen based on “methane emissions, proximity to disproportionately impacted communities or municipalities, and financial assurance plans,” according to the state’s Energy and Carbon Management Commission.
The federal Republican tax break and spending cut law that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 rescinded any remaining un-obligated federal funding that was part of the Methane Emissions Reduction Program.

PETERSBURG — State-appointed auditors came to St. Petersburg Wednesday to begin two days reviewing spending by Mayor Ken Welch and the majority Democratic-led City Council.
Confronting them was a group of local residents in front of City Hall who declared they didn’t trust what the DeSantis administration says is the motivation for looking into local government spending.
Mimicking the federal initiative led by Elon Musk in the first months of the second Trump administration, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis introduced Florida’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) earlier this year, describing it as an effort to eliminate waste within state  government, save taxpayers money, and ensure accountability.
But it’s been turbocharged into a higher gear, looking at municipal and county government spending, ever since DeSantis appointed former GOP state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia as chief financial officer last month.
“Look, all of this is … because property taxes have been skyrocketing here in the state of Florida,” Ingoglia told reporters inside St. Petersburg City Hall on Wednesday.
But the critics who stood outside in the blazing heat earlier said they weren’t buying it.
“They have no business messing around with our city government,” said St. Pete resident Diane Willis. “They don’t even run our own state government well. I mean, the governor talked about transparency and accountability was the reason for DOGE.
“He should look in his own backyard,” she continued, explicitly naming Hope Florida, the community-based welfare program initiated by First Lady Casey DeSantis that came under fire earlier this year and whose foundation is reportedly being investigated by state prosecutors.
“I think it’s a lie,” added Seminole resident Mary McMullen, who grew up in St. Petersburg, about the stated mission of DOGE to eliminate waste in government spending. “That’s not why they’re here.”
DEI
“Their letter talked about DEI,” McMullen said. “It talked about whether we have electric vehicles. It talked about the environment and that we are having the nerve to get involved in anything that might speak about problems with the environment. So, if they were here for what they say they were here for I’m fine, but that’s not it.”
McMullen was referencing the nine-page letter sent by Florida DOGE to St. Petersburg officials on Aug. 1, which made numerous references to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policies adopted in the city in recent years. Auditors also said that they wanted information about policies regarding resiliency and battling climate change, as well as specific purchases or leases of electric vehicles.
That’s a problem, as far as City Council member Brandi Gabbard is concerned.

“Surprisingly and upsettingly, there’s also a lot of questions regarding our resilience work and sustainability work. And we live in a coastal community where we’re incredibly vulnerable. And so to think that those sorts of initiatives could potentially be opposed by our state, to me really doesn’t look like moving forward in a cohesive way to protect the residents that we serve,” she told the Phoenix while walking out of City Hall to observe the protest on Wednesday.
In January 2019, St. Petersburg was selected to participate in the American Cities Climate Challenge, an initiative backed by Bloomberg Philanthropies to tackle climate change and promote a sustainable future. Florida DOGE is now requesting records of “all actions, communications and expenditures to date in support” of that program.
Like most locally elected officials who have been interviewed by the news reporters ahead of planned DOGE visits, Gabbard said she welcomed state officials scrutinizing the city budget, because she believes the council and Welch have been “good stewards” of the public’s money.
“I would push back on any claim that there’s any waste within those tax dollars,” she said. “As far as any savings to be found, if there’s an opportunity to save a single penny that is a taxpayer dollar, we certainly want to look at that, but we are very confident in what we spend our tax dollars on and that is to get the best service that we possibly can for the city of St Petersburg.”
‘A long-term thing’
Florida DOGE’s two-day audit of St. Petersburg’s budget comes two days after a similar inquiry began across the bay with the Hillsborough County Commission. There, Ingoglia promised that this month’s inquiries were not a one-and-done situation.
“We have a lot of work to do with the counties. We have a lot of work to do with the cities. But what I can tell you is that I’m not going away,” he said on Monday. “Cities and counties should not be mistaken that this is a short-term thing. This is a long-term thing.”
During a Tampa press conference, DeSantis appeared surprised when asked about the planned protest against DOGE in St.  Petersburg.
“What are they protesting?” he asked of the photojournalist who posed the question.
“They don’t like DOGE,” the journalist responded.
The governor replied by talking about the rise in property taxes, as he and Ingoglia have been campaigning for a 2026 constitutional amendment that would ask voters to limit taxes on homestead properties. Such an initiative would have to be approved by the Legislature early next year, and there are no specific details about what it would entail at this time.
“The question is, you’ve seen a lot of bloated budgets,” DeSantis said. “Where is that money going to? And they’ll say that it’s for things that we all agree on. Education. Public safety. First responders. But I can tell you, there’s a lot of stuff beyond that that some of these governments are spending these tax dollars on.”
“Do you need to be spending $3 million on DEI consultants?” he said, perhaps in reference to St. Petersburg’s budget. “Would  you rather them spending it on that, or would you rather have property tax cuts?”

One of the largest concerns centers on the idea of “churn” — people who become eligible or not eligible, almost like a light switch turning off and on, because of administrative paperwork.
Montana already has “work” requirements, or exemptions for those on Medicaid. According to the most recent published study, 97% of those already meet the exemptions to qualify, according to “Medicaid in Montana,” an annual report that tracks the program’s usage in Montana, funded by the Montana Healthcare Foundation.
 

  Federal fallout: Medicaid and insurance in Montana 

The Daily Montanan is launching a series of articles that breaks down some of the biggest changes implemented by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in the so-called “Big, beautiful bill.”
All four members of Montana’s Congressional delegation — Republicans Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke — voted for these changes. 
Today’s stories are the third installment:
Redetermination redo: New work requirements put in place by the Trump administration and narrowly approved by Congress mean that states will now need more documentation and verification that those receiving Medicaid are eligible because they’re working or meet an exemption. Montana’s history with the “determination” and “redetermination” process means that residents who qualify could be accidentally left without insurance while the state must now be in a state of increased processing and reprocessing. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Reality check: About all those people watching TV. For years, many conservatives, including U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, have claimed legions of people were essentially freeloading off the government, collecting health insurance benefits without work. However, PolitiFact digs into that claim and finds the narrative, while politically satisfying, is a fiction. (Story by PolitiFact and KFF Health News)
Determining difficulties: The “big, beautiful bill” will require those who want Medicaid to undergo a process of determination for eligibility. The work requirements are new for many states, and they’ll require verification and documentation, which will substantially increase the workload for states, leading some to say the process could be too much to handle. (Story by Stateline)
Our previous stories have included:  
Another big change in the Big Sky: Whether you’re one of more than 100,000 people on Medicaid or whether you purchase your health insurance on the marketplace (healthcare.gov), recent federal changes will mean a decrease in people who qualify under expanded Medicaid, as well as hefty health insurance premium hikes from those who purchase a plan. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Is $50 billion enough: Congress has allocated $50 billion to be used for rural state hospitals, which had been identified as particularly vulnerable in the “Big, beautiful” bill. Republicans from rural states demanded the money in exchange for the support, but will the fund be enough? And, what happens after it’s depleted? (Story by Stateline)
Navigators no more: In February, Congress also voted to defund most of the health insurance navigators at the state level. In Montana, 90% of the navigators won’t be available after many of these changes become reality, leaving residents to answer questions on their own, or try their luck accessing one of the few left after the cuts. These navigators helped residents find insurance, understand their eligibility and explain policy differences. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Less leeway: States like Montana had previously come up with their own work eligibility and verification programs. But with the new Trump rules surrounding Medicaid, that means states have less flexibility and fewer resources to navigate the changes (Story by KFF Health News)
 



However, Montana’s experience with the “disenrollment” process is making some wonder if history is about to repeat itself — over and over again.
The concern centers on the amount of work the new legislation requires.
Now, not only are work requirements mandatory for much of Medicaid eligibility, those requirements force a whole new system of verification and paperwork. That paperwork and eligibility has to be documented and reviewed, mostly by state-level workers who “determine” a resident’s eligibility.
Montana’s Medicaid landscape changed dramatically two years ago when the Legislature opted to discontinue a policy of “continuous eligibility,” which ensured that if a person qualified for Medicaid coverage, they remained on it for a year, until it was time to redetermine if the person was still eligible.
As Montana rolled out its new verification and determination process, members of the public, healthcare officials and lawmakers were outraged at the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services. As many as one-third of those enrolled had a lapse in healthcare coverage because of administrative issues, from missing documents to impossibly long wait-times where people would be left stranded on hold for hours. Gradually, as state health department workers worked through redetermining the entire Medicaid population of Montana, which numbered, at the time, more than 120,000, officials caught up.
But now, with new work requirements, new documentation and verification that must happen at least twice a year, providers are worried that people who qualify for Medicaid coverage will lose it due to the same administrative challenges.
“These people if they’re working hard and low income, there is a lot of documentation to it,” said Dr. Aaron Wernham, CEO of Montana Healthcare Foundation. His organization has studied the effects of “redetermination” as it rolled out in Montana, but also spoken with other states.
“Documentation is hard and it requires a lot of the state. Each single case takes time,” Wernham said.
He said work-requirement programs in other states have had mixed results. For example, Wernham said that Georgia has experimented with it.
“It costs an enormous amount of money because of the verification. It’s very expensive,” Wernham said. “If you talk to a lot of clinics, what they’re really worried about is that people will just disappear.”
He said that means that many will likely become overwhelmed or frustrated with the process and just delay seeking medical care.
The Daily Montanan reached out to officials from the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services on several occasions with questions about its capacity and processes given the new federal legislation. No official responded to those requests.
“We saw what happened when the state did it all at once,” said Montana Hospital Association CEO Ed Buttrey. Buttrey was a Republican member of the Montana Legislature through the 2025 session, and many of his colleagues on both sides of the political aisle were frustrated. “It’s not that bad now, but what happens when they start doing this every six months?”
  Another looming reality 

As officials are scrambling to figure out what the new determination and requirements will be for Medicaid going forward, the financial reality in Montana is even more severe, compared with larger or younger states.
“Many of those people are probably expected to drop their coverage before they have been priced out altogether,” said Cynthia Cox, the vice president of KFF Health for ACA Programs. “And those folks, the people who make more than four times poverty are disproportionately older adults, like pre-retirees or early retirees, they’re more likely to live in rural areas and they’re more likely to be small business owners.”
The state’s aging population means more and more healthcare institutions rely on Medicaid or Medicare. But that reliance puts a premium on two other areas — private-pay insurance or strictly managing “uncompensated,” or “charity” care, where a healthcare system doesn’t receive a full payment or any payment for services it provides.
Because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have lower reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals, private insurance plans usually wind up subsidizing Medicare and Medicaid patients. However, because the state has such a high percentage of people who utilize the federal programs, the number of people considering not having health insurance is sky rocketing.
Cynthia Cox, the Vice President of KFF’s Program on the ACA, said the reality will begin in January, and once it begins, it will be a difficult trend to reverse.
“The Congressional Budget Office expect that eventually, 4 million people will become uninsured due to the expiration of these enhanced premium tax credits,” Cox said. “I would expect that to play out with a big drop in coverage Jan. 1 or so and then over a longer period of time, eventually adding up to 4 million. That’s going to happen in less than six months.”
That means there could be a resurgence of uncompensated care, which could lead to hospital closures. Nearly half of Montana is covered by either Medicaid or Medicare. According to the Montana Health Foundation, 22% of the state has Medicaid, while the federal government reports 20% are on Medicare.
“We have a handful of hospitals that are over 50% Medicaid and so even small shifts in revenue streams could be really detrimental,” said Katy Mack, the vice president of the Montana Hospital Association.
Some rural hospital margins are lower than one-half of one percent.
“We just don’t have the wiggle room to treat a patient without pay,” she said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-940167624-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 15:57:08.707449

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”
 

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.



There isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.


– Dr. Benjamin Sommers, health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
  Arkansas’ example 

Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.
 

Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
  Other state efforts 

Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.
States that enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions could be in a bind

The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

That’s Unsupported
“Almost 5 million able-bodied Medicaid recipients ‘simply choose not to work’ and ‘spend six hours a day socializing and watching television.’”
Scott Jennings on “CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip” on July 1
Republicans defended the GOP megabill’s Medicaid changes as targeting a group of people they believe shouldn’t qualify: People who can work but instead choose to stay home and chill.
Several Republican politicians and pundits, including CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings, pegged that group’s size at about 5 million people.
“There are like almost 5 million able-bodied people on Medicaid who simply choose not to work,” Jennings said July 1 on “CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip.” “They spend six hours a day socializing and watching television. And if you can’t get off grandma’s couch and work, I don’t want to pay for your welfare.”
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz picked up on some of these points during a July 14 appearance on Fox News. “When the program was created 60 years ago, it never dawned on anyone that you would take able-bodied individuals who could work and put them on Medicaid. Today the average able-bodied person on Medicaid who doesn’t work, they watch 6.1 hours of television or just hang out,” Oz said.
The same talking points were picked up nearly verbatim by Montana’s senior Republican Sen. Steve Daines, who repeated the assertion on Fox News:

“The bottom line is this, Republicans are trying to save Medicaid. We want to strengthen Medicaid, while the Democrats are trying to drain Medicaid. So the reforms that we are proposing, what you just described there in the so-called provider tax, that’s just a scheme that are used by the states to actually get more dollars than the federal government. This is one of the fastest growing entitlements currently in federal spending. It’s designed to protect those who are most vulnerable. It’s an important safety net, but we’ve got to reform Medicaid if we’re going to save Medicaid. We’ve got to take able -bodied males who are laying on the couches at home and get them back to work and off of Medicaid. Put a work requirement in and the reforms we have made we think are reasonable and it’s, again, the way we save this very important safety net.“ 
 
Medicaid is a federal-state health insurance program that covers medical care for lower-income people.
Jennings cited two pieces of data: An estimate of how many fewer people would have coverage because of the work requirement and an analysis of how nonworking Medicaid recipients spend their time. But he made assumptions that the data doesn’t support.
  Jennings Misrepresents CBO Estimate 

The 4.8 million figure stems from a June 24 Congressional Budget Office analysis of a preliminary House version of the massive tax and spending package. The office, Congress’ nonpartisan research arm, projected that provisions of the bill would cause 7.8 million fewer people to have health coverage by 2034. They would include 4.8 million people previously eligible for Medicaid described as “able-bodied” adults 19 to 64 years old who have no dependents and who “do not meet the community engagement requirement” of doing “work-related activities” at least 80 hours a month.
Apart from working, doing community service and attending school also fulfill the community engagement requirement.
Jennings paired that statistic with a separate analysis of how nondisabled adult Medicaid recipients without dependent children spend their time.
But the CBO estimate was a projection — it doesn’t represent the current number of nondisabled Medicaid recipients, nor does it say 4.8 million people in this group “choose not to work.” The figure represented how many fewer people would have coverage because of the bill’s community engagement requirement.
“The challenge with Jennings’ comments — and they’ve been echoed elsewhere by elected Republicans — is that CBO never said that 4.8 million people were out of compliance with the proposed work requirements; they said that 4.8 million people would lose coverage because of the work requirements,” said Adrianna McIntyre, an assistant professor of health policy and politics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Among the Medicaid expansion population, the law requires most adults without dependent children and parents of children older than 13 to work or participate in other qualifying activities 80 hours every month. States will need to verify that applicants met the work requirement for one to three months before they applied. States will also be required to verify that existing enrollees met the work requirement for at least a month between eligibility determinations, which will be required at least twice a year.
Research into Medicaid work requirements imposed at the state level has shown that people found it difficult to fulfill them and submit documentation, contributing to coverage losses.
In Arkansas, which added a work requirement to Medicaid in 2018, a study based on nearly 6,000 respondents found that about 95% of the target population were already working or qualified for an exemption, but a third of them did not hear about the work requirements. As a result, nearly 17,000 Medicaid recipients subject to work requirements lost coverage.
KFF found that adults ages 50 to 64 are more at risk of losing Medicaid coverage because of the new work requirements. More than 1 in 10 in that age group said they had retired, and among them, 28% reported being disabled, said KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Benjamin Sommers, a health care economics professor at the Harvard Chan school, said many of the 4.8 million “able-bodied” people in the CBO estimate “will actually be engaged in the activities they are supposed to be doing, and lose coverage because they are not able to navigate the reporting requirements with the state and lose coverage from red tape.”
  When Recipients Don’t Work, It’s Rarely From Lack of Interest 

There is no universal definition for “able-bodied”; disability can be assessed in different ways. But other studies offer much smaller estimates than 4.8 million Medicaid recipients without dependents who can work but choose not to.
Millions of working-age, nondisabled adults joined the Medicaid ranks in states that expanded eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. There were about 34 million working-age nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 2024, according to the CBO, 15 million of whom enrolled through the ACA.
A KFF analysis found a smaller figure of 26 million Medicaid-covered adults, ages 19 to 64, who don’t receive Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, or Medicare benefits.
Among this group, KFF estimated, 64% were working either full time or part time. The reasons the rest were not working included caregiving (12%); illness or disability (10%); retirement, inability to find work, or other reason (8%); and school attendance (7%).
Few people cited lack of interest in working as the reason for their unemployment. An Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents who neither worked nor attended school — or 300,000 people out of a projected 15 million subject to work requirements — cited a lack of interest in working as the reason they were unemployed.
This was consistent with the Brookings Institution’s June 5 analysis that found that, of 4.3 million adult enrollees who worked fewer than 80 hours a month and did not have any activity limitations or illnesses, about 300,000 reported that they “did not work because they did not want to.”
  Mostly Women, Mostly With a High School Degree or Less 

When Republicans have described nondisabled adult Medicaid recipients, they have often portrayed them as men in their 30s “playing video games” in their parents’ basement or who “smoke weed all day.” Research paints a different picture.
Jane Tavares and Marc Cohen, of the University of Massachusetts-Boston Gerontology Department, researched Medicaid recipients who are not disabled or working, have no dependent children under 18, and are not in school. They cited 2023 census data from the American Community Survey.
They found:

The average age of this population is 41, and 26% are older than 50.
Almost 80% are female.
Most, 80%, have a high school education or less.
Their median individual income is $0, and their median household income is $44,800.
About 56% worked in the past five years, and 23% worked in the prior year. About 30% are looking or available for work.

“They are not healthy young adults just hanging out,” the authors, along with health law experts Sara Rosenbaum and Alison Barkoff, wrote April 30.
“It’s clear based on their prior work history and family size/income that they are exceptionally poor and have likely left the workforce to care for adult children or older adults,” Tavares told PolitiFact. “Even if these individuals could work, they would have very few job opportunities and it would come at the cost of the people they are providing care for.”
  AEI Study Not Definitively Linked to CBO Estimate 

On the social platform X, Jennings posted the CBO letter and a May 29 analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, about “how nondisabled Medicaid recipients without children spend their time.” PolitiFact contacted CNN to reach Jennings but did not receive a reply.
The author of that study, American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Kevin Corinth, analyzed survey data and found that Medicaid recipients who do not report working spend on average 6.1 hours a day “on all socializing, relaxing and leisure activities (including television and video games).”
But it’s uncertain whether the people in the survey population he analyzed overlap with the people included in the CBO analysis, said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of KFF’s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
Corinth told PolitiFact “it is difficult to say” how the population he analyzed differs from the CBO’s. Tavares, Cohen, Rosenbaum, and Barkoff said Corinth’s dataset defined disability narrowly, leading to a “serious underestimation of disability” among the population of Medicaid recipients he looked into. It focused on Medicaid recipients who receive Supplemental Security Income or have a health condition that prevents them from working. The researchers said this approach is too narrow because the SSI program accounts for only those “most deeply impoverished adults with severe disabilities.”
The group gave a hypothetical example of a 54-year-old woman with a serious heart condition who can work only a few hours a week. She may not be considered disabled under the SSI program, but she may be limited in the work she can do and may need time to rest.
“Using her ‘leisure time’ to justify a work requirement grossly misrepresents her reality,” the group wrote.
Corinth’s analysis also shows that nonworking Medicaid recipients spend less time socializing, relaxing, or engaged in leisure activities than nonworking people who aren’t covered by Medicaid. Nonworking Medicaid recipients also spend more time looking for work and doing housework and errands, it found.
  Our Ruling 

Jennings said almost 5 million nondisabled Medicaid recipients “simply choose not to work” and “spend six hours a day socializing and watching television.”
The 5 million figure stems from a CBO projection that 4.8 million people would go without coverage by 2034 as a result of not fulfilling the community engagement requirements. It is not descriptive of current enrollees and does not specify that these people choose not to work.
Jennings cited an American Enterprise Institute analysis on how nondisabled Medicaid recipients with no dependents spend their time, but it is uncertain if the population in that analysis overlaps with that in the CBO estimate.
Current snapshots of the population Jennings described produce a smaller number. A survey by the Urban Institute found that 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents who were neither working nor attending school — about 300,000 people — cited a lack of interest in working. Other research has found reasons this group doesn’t work include caregiving, illness or disability, retirement, and inability to find work.
Studies of nonworking Medicaid recipients have found the majority are women and have a high school education or less. Their average age is 41, and more than half have a work history in the past five years.
We rate Jennings’ statement False.

“Idahoans are sick of scammers targeting their families through illegal robocalls,” Labrador said in the release. “We’re putting these telecommunications providers on notice that they must follow federal rules immediately.”
The providers have not complied with Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, rules regarding responding to government traceback requests — in which the origination and delivery of robocalls is traced —  have not registered in the FCC’s Robocall Mitigation Databases, or have not filed a plan to describe how they will reduce illegal robocalls.
“By disregarding these simple rules, these companies are allowing robocallers onto their phone networks and then passing their calls on to other downstream providers until they reach the phones of Idahoans,” the release said.
The task force is also sending letters to 99 “downstream” providers that accept calls from the 37 companies to inform them that they are “doing business with bad actors that are not willing to follow the rules that apply to everyone equally,” the release said. 
Officials from the FCC, in addition to the task force’s work, announced Tuesday that they would remove seven of the 37 providers from the Robocall Mitigation Database, which means that other providers will no longer be allowed to accept and route any calls from their networks.

In 2022, 51 attorneys general joined forces to create the Anti-Robocall Litigation Task Force, which is led by North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. The task force investigates and takes legal action against companies responsible for significant volumes of illegal and fraudulent robocall traffic routed into and across the country, the release said. 
In April, Labrador notified nine voice service providers that they may be violating state and federal laws by continuing to route allegedly unlawful robocalls across their networks.

Julio Fuentes. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Self-described conservative business leaders assembled in Tallahassee Wednesday to sound the alarm over the potential loss of federal funds at the end of the year to lower the costs of so-called Obamacare health plans for more than 4.7 million Florida residents.
“I have been around this debate over health care coverage for decades and, while the politics of the ACA [Affordable Care Act] have been heated over the years, there should be a unified political voice in support of the federal marketplace and the premiums assistance in Florida,” said Florida Hospital Association President and CEO Mary Mayhew.
Joining Mayhew were Associated Industries of Florida President and CEO Brewster Bevis; Jonathan Chapman, president and CEO of Florida Association of Community Health Centers; and Julio Fuentes, president and CEO of the Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
 They each stressed the importance of the enhanced premium tax credits and how the state’s economy would suffer if Congress allows them to expire at the end of the year.
“From the Florida business community, the best way to keep us up and running is to have a healthy workforce,” Bevis said. If the enhanced premiums expire, costs would go up for the millions of people who purchase insurance through the federal health care marketplace known as healthcare.gov, he added. 
The cost increases, Bevis said, could lead people to drop their health coverage, which would increase the number of uninsured residents in the state.
That “slows down the employee’s recuperation time, getting healthy again and getting back in the workforce. And like I said, I mean all of these people are part of our family and you care about them,” Bevis said.
Advanced premium tax credits have been available since passage of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. During COVID, Congress agreed to make the premium tax credits more generous. Those enhanced credits lower out-of-pocket costs for the coverage and allow people who earn more money to qualify for the subsidies.
They are set to expire at the end of the year. Red Hills Consulting created “Florida Conservatives for Affordable Health Care” to help call attention to the issue. A second press conference will be held in Miami next week, Fuentes told reporters.
Florida Conservatives also has launched a letter-writing campaign to urge members of Congress to keep the enhanced subsidies intact.
Uphill battle

It may prove an uphill battle. Of Florida’s 28 representatives in the U.S. House, 20 are Republicans and eight are Democrats. Florida’s U.S. senators are both Republicans, and senior Sen. Rick Scott, who previously served as governor, ran for that office in 2010 largely on an anti-Obamacare platform. He founded Conservatives for Patients’ Rights in 2009 to oppose Obamcare.
The potential elimination of the enhanced advanced premium tax credits looms as residents face double-digit health insurance premiums next year. Fourteen insurers offering individual health plans proposed double-digit rate increases, a review of insurance rates on a federal website shows.
The rates haven’t been finalized and could change but premium hikes in the coming year are all but guaranteed.
Watch out for double-digit health insurance increases in 2026

Molina Healthcare is proposing a 41% rate change for calendar year 2026, more than any other plan. According to its supporting rate documents the rate would affect up to more than 90,000 members. 
The federal rate review process is expected to be completed by the end of the summer. Open enrollment for 2026 individual coverage under Obamacare begins in the fall.
Insurers blamed rising costs, utilization of services, and the loss of enhanced advanced premium tax benefits as the reasons behind the rate increase, according to KFF, which reviewed the proposed rates.
Carriers also filed proposed rate increases for plans sold to Florida’s small employers for 2026 — those with staffs of 50 or fewer. While less steep than the individual policies, many of the carriers requested double-digit or near double-digit increases. 
Neighborhood Health Partnership requested the highest overall increase for small group plans with a proposed overall 12.78% rate hike, whereas National Health Insurance Co. came in with the smallest proposed rate increase, at 8.38%.
Neither Florida’s top insurance regulator nor the Florida Insurance Consumer Advocate’s office have warned residents of the impending increases.
Mayhew said she’s worried Florida residents aren’t aware of the double-digit health insurance premiums hikes headed their way, or the potential loss of the enhanced premium tax credits.
“We should be educating the population who depend on this and get them engaged in communicating with their members of Congress. This can be fixed. Plenty of issues federally have been up against a sunset and have been extended. This is not difficult. It must be done.”

Conservative judges might allow lawmakers to reinstate the practice of conversion therapy, which aims to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.


– Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in New York City whose research focuses on gender and sexuality


Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-13 19:00:58+00:00,Mississippi Today,Morgan Freeman: Young dreamers in Mississippi should ‘get a book’,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/13/morgan-freeman-young-dreamers-in-mississippi-should-get-a-book/,Award-winning actor Freeman headlined an inaugural fundraising event for the Mississippi Early Learning Alliance.,"Morgan Freeman had a simple message for people attending the Mississippi Early Learning Alliance’s inaugural fundraising luncheon on Tuesday. 
When asked what advice he’d give to an 8-year-old in Mississippi with big dreams, Freeman said just three words: “Get a book.”
Freeman, an Academy Award-winning actor, headlined the “Big Voices for Little Children” fundraiser for the alliance, which is dedicated to improving early learning and child development outcomes. 
More than 200 advocates, politicians and local leaders attended the luncheon, including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and blues musician Bobby Rush. The event was hosted at the Two Mississippi Museums in downtown Jackson and primarily sponsored by TrueCare, a  nonprofit created by Mississippi hospitals as an alternative to traditional managed care.
The luncheon comes at a critical time for early learning in Mississippi and on the heels of statewide reading gains that have garnered national attention. That wasn’t lost on speakers at the event, including Freeman. 
Executive director Biz Harris opened the fundraiser by underscoring how important successful early education systems are to the state’s success as a whole. 
“Every single day in Mississippi, nearly 100 new babies are born,” she said. “That’s 100 new beginnings — 100 new chances for our state to make the future a little stronger and a little brighter.”
She listed a number of initiatives aimed at improving early learning in Mississippi, including Hosemann’s task force on families and children and the successful passage of a bill that guarantees six weeks of paid parental leave for state employees. 
Harris also detailed her personal struggles with child care — struggles that almost prevented her from accepting her current job. 
Almost a decade ago, she was offered a position by SonEdna, the organization founded by Freeman that helped launch the alliance. It was her dream job, she said, but she couldn’t find child care for her 2-year-old son. After calling every local program, Harris said, she pieced together a child care plan for her son, but it wasn’t ideal. For nine months, her son bounced between programs. 
“He was safe, he was cared for, he was learning, but that constant transition shaped his development and comfort with new situations in ways that we still see him struggle with as a sixth grader,” she said. “I share this because what babies experience in those early years matters so much. It affects their education and their health for the rest of their lives.”
Freeman said his own education in Greenwood influenced his trajectory as an actor and advocate for children’s education, which led to his role as polyester-clad Easy Reader on education children’s television show “The Electric Company” in the 1970s. 
As people ate lunch, Freeman recounted stories from his childhood and shared his love of reading.
“When I was 8 years old and living in Chicago, I had a library card,” he said. “My first book that didn’t have pictures was ‘Black Beauty.’ So there I was, reading, reading, reading. And my penchant for adventure came from those books.”
Freeman regaled the audience with other personal tidbits, too, like his version of a perfect day in Mississippi (“riding horses”) and what kind of student he was in school (“a teacher’s pet”).

(Getty Images)The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities on Wednesday approved $100 utility bill credits meant to defray the impact of surging electricity prices.
In a unanimous vote, the regulator’s three board members approved credits that will reduce residential monthly electricity bills by $50 in September and in October, part of state officials’ latest bid to curb energy costs amid summer heat and soaring rates.
“This should be helpful for people, but in no way solves the problem. I hope this helps some people get over the hump. This is a very difficult time,” said Commissioner Zenon Christodoulou.
All residential ratepayers are eligible for the credits, regardless of their income.
Electricity rates have surged nationwide, driven upward in part by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth energy demand, while New Jersey’s plans for new renewable generation — chiefly in the form of offshore wind — have largely failed to provide relief.
Wholesale electricity prices rose by roughly 20% in June and are due to rise as much as 5% when the results of a recent price-setting capacity auction take effect in June 2026. Regulators have said they expect prices to rise even further in a capacity auction planned for next July.
The credits will be funded by funds from the solar alternative compliance payment, which is paid by electricity suppliers that are unable to meet the state’s renewables standard, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which generates funds by auctioning tradeable emissions allowances to fossil fuel plants.
Solar funds, tallied at $263 million Wednesday, would be used before money from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which totaled $123 million Wednesday, Board of Public Utilities staff said.
The credits are part of a plan Gov. Phil Murphy and other state Democrats announced days after higher prices took effect in early June.
That month, the board approved a plan to defer $60 total from electricity bills in July and August, when high temperatures and air conditioning drive power use to a peak. Ratepayers are responsible for repaying those deferred balances, which do not accrue interest or other carrying costs, over the following six months.
“We want to make sure we’re doing everything we can, and we’ll continue to do everything we can with the resources that we have to reduce costs for ratepayers,” said Board of Public Utilities President Christine Guhl-Sadovy.
At the same time, the board approved other programs that extended $175 in bill credits to low-income ratepayers. Those credits are to be applied in equal installments over seven months, from August to February 2026. That benefit was paid last year as a single $175 credit to August utility bills.
Democrats have blamed PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states, for recent rate increases, arguing it has been too slow to connect chiefly renewable projects to its grid.
Republicans have blamed Murphy’s renewables-heavy energy goals and the administration’s focus on offshore wind, which has failed to stand up any new generation.

The state’s offshore wind projects appear dead in the water amid opposition from the Trump administration, which has paused or rescinded leases and permits for such projects, and lingering supply chain issues stemming from the pandemic.
The board on Wednesday approved an order terminating a contract with Atlantic Shores for a 1,509-megawatt wind farm off the coast of Atlantic City.
The developer requested that cancellation in June, citing federal uncertainty and the Trump administration’s withdrawal of a Clean Air Act permit needed for construction. The project’s first 762 megawatts of generation were due to come online in September 2027, with the remaining generation expected to start by April 2028.
Atlantic Shores sought to rebid that project, but the utilities board closed its fourth round of offshore wind solicitations without awarding any projects, citing uncertainty at the federal level.
Regulators acknowledged plans for wind generation would have to wait at least a few years. On Wednesday, the board approved an order delaying required in-service dates for offshore wind transmission infrastructure by two-and-a-half years.
Officials said the delay is meant to ease cost pressures by delaying transmission infrastructure investments, which ratepayers fund through their utility bills, without any electricity to bring to shore.
“Obviously, some federal uncertainty has created a situation where we need to make sure we’re acting in a way that we always do — on the best interest of ratepayers,” Guhl-Sadovy said. “This, along with some of the other actions today, are in response to some of those federal decisions around clean energy.”
Those projects, now required to be in service by January 2033, are meant to bring electricity from offshore wind turbines to the coast and prepare the grid for that power.
The order did little to shake environmental groups’ commitment to wind energy.
“Offshore wind is critical to our clean energy portfolio and to protecting our health, environment, and economy. Every delay forces our residents—especially low-income families and communities of color—to breathe dirty air and bear the brunt of climate change. We’ve been knocked down, but we’ll keep getting back up,” said Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

A change to the state’s enforcement of the 80-day maximum could mean hundreds without shelter return to emergency housing, advocates say.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Vermont’s Department for Children and Families has appealed an Aug. 7 Human Services Board decision that found the state had incorrectly enforced the 80-day limit on its motel voucher program.
The citizen panel reversed the department’s denial of emergency housing for petitioner “H.D.,” an individual with a severe medical condition whose name is being withheld, on the basis that they had already exhausted the 80-day maximum outlined in state law. 
In June, local aid providers expressed surprise and dismay at the state’s enforcement of the time limit in relation to Gov. Phil Scott’s March executive order to extend emergency housing for certain medically vulnerable people and children through the end of the fiscal year. On July 1, over 800 people exited from motels across the state. Advocates said a change to the state’s enforcement could mean hundreds without shelter return to emergency housing.
Documents obtained by VTDigger show that Timothy Connors, chief of the state Attorney General’s Agency of Human Services Legal Division, filed an appeal of the Human Services Board’s decision to the Vermont Supreme Court on Monday.

The Attorney General’s office declined to comment, and the Department for Children and Families did not respond to requests for comment.
Vermont Legal Aid, which represented H.D. during their hearing, released a statement last week following the Human Services Board’s decision urging others who were denied emergency housing due to exceeding the 80-day limit to request a hearing of their own. 
Maryellen Griffin, a staff attorney for Vermont Legal Aid, said state law limits the department’s ability to consider past use of the program when reviewing applications.
“It never says anything about going backwards or counting days from fiscal year 2025,” she said. 
The state owes each qualifying applicant 80 days of emergency housing during the current fiscal year by law, Griffin said, within the program’s volume restrictions. As of Aug. 4, of the 1,100 rooms provided by the state, 518 were occupied. 
“Our understanding is that the state plans to force each person to go through an individual appeals process,” she said. 
Griffin said she was aware of her organization’s involvement in roughly 20 active cases of this kind. 
“Our intake is certainly way up just the past couple days,” she said.
Though the actual appeal process may take months, Griffin said hearing officers have sometimes issued “benefits pending appeal,” meaning the person appealing may be granted housing while their case is being adjudicated.
Still, Griffin said the case-by-case approach is a waste of valuable time and resources. 
“I think that it would be much better for the department to simply implement the correct interpretation across the board,” she said.
The ultimate outcome of H.D.’s appeal and related cases will depend on the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court.
If the state’s appeal is rejected, hundreds of people could gain emergency housing through such petitions, according to Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont. 
Her organization is working on about 40 ongoing cases related to the issue, she said, adding “that’s just a small fraction of the people who this impacts.”
According to Siegel, some medically vulnerable people who lost housing July 1 have already died, while others have gone without food for long stretches to try and keep a roof over their heads. 
“It’s a big deal,” Siegel said. “This emergency shelter is life-saving.”
A main challenge faced by local aid providers is keeping clients informed of their options, Siegel and Griffin said. 
They said it wasn’t clear that people who used Scott’s extension would have those days counted toward their housing limit later that calendar year. 
Now, they want to ensure unhoused people with children or qualifying medical issues know they may be able to successfully appeal if they have been denied shelter for overstaying the 80-day limit. 
“People living with disabilities who are experiencing homelessness deserve to survive our state’s housing crisis,” Siegel said.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
South Carolinians are renting out their cars. A bill would put ‘guard rails’ on the income booster.

Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars.
With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years.
Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

Joni Ernst has not officially said if she plans to run for reelection in 2026 — but she told a GOP audience Wednesday that Democrats should “bring it on” in the 2026 midterm elections.
“Every day we get a new Democratic member of the House or Senate that decides to run for this Senate seat — bring it on,” Ernst, a Republican,  said at the Westside Conservative Club in Urbandale. “Bring it on, folks. Because I tell you, at the end of the day, Iowa is going to be red.”
The race for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat has become a crowded over the past few months. There are five Democrats running to become their party nominee — state Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, who announced his race Tuesday, as well as Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville; Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City; Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage. Two Republicans, former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, a previous Libertarian candidate, have also announced their campaigns for the seat.

But Ernst, who is serving her second term, has yet to say whether she plans to run for reelection. During her visit to the Iowa State Fair, over the weekend, she told reporters an announcement would be “coming soon.”
Some speculated that Ernst was considering retirement from Congress. While she raised more than her Democratic challengers who had entered the race in the second quarter Federal Election Commission filings, she raised less in the period than she had at this point in her 2020 reelection campaign. Politico also reported in July there were concerns among Senate Republicans that she would not run for reelection, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune telling a reporter he was “doing everything I can to encourage her to run for reelection.”
In recent months, Ernst has faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Her town hall comment in May, “well, we all are going to die,” when responding to a person who shouted to her about Medicaid cuts in the  budget reconciliation bill gained national attention and pushback. Among Republicans, she has been criticized for expressing concerns about U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during the nomination process, though she voted to confirm him.
Ernst touts cuts in taxes, spending
In addition to talking about the upcoming election season Wednesday, Ernst also celebrated some of the GOP wins since President Donald Trump was elected. Though she did not talk about Medicaid and SNAP provisions in the budget reconciliation law, she said provisions like updated reference prices for farmers and tax exemptions for overtime will help Iowa families, farms and businesses.
She also said the measure will provide “a lot of tax relief for a heck of a lot of people across the United States.”
“Right here in Iowa, if we had not supported the one big beautiful bill, an average household here in Iowa would have seen their tax bill increase by $2,060. $2,060. We avoided that,” Ernst said. “Think about all the Democrats — they voted for a $2,000 tax increase for Iowans, and we’re not going to have that.”
Turek, in an interview Wednesday, said Ernst’s support for measures like the budget reconciliation bill are one of the reason why many Iowans who have previously supported Republicans are looking to Democrats in the upcoming election.
“In the urban areas and in the rural areas, we are getting turnouts like we haven’t seen, with a lot of buyers’ remorse, of people that have said, ‘I voted for Trump, I voted for Ernst, but this is not what I signed up for’ — not for cuts to health care to poor kids and the disabled, not for cuts to food assistance, just to give billionaires tax breaks,” Turek said.
In addition to highlighting tax cuts in the budget reconciliation bill, Ernst said her work to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government has come to pass through the rescissions bill, canceling previously approved federal funding for U.S. Agency for International Development and public broadcasting, as well as through the federal DOGE service.
Ernst said heading into 2025, she met with billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy as they prepared to lead the Department of Government Efficiency initiative in the Trump administration to discuss areas for savings in the federal government identified through work like her “squeal awards.”
“I was able to present them with an eight-page document that outlined $2 trillion of savings in our federal government,” Ernst said. “Now, trying to get to that $2 trillion mark is pretty darn hard. We’ve got a lot of pushback coming from the Democrats and the unions that exist within federal government. So we’re running into a number of roadblocks, but we will continue to build upon that success.”
Neither Ramaswamy, who is running for Ohio governor, nor Musk is still affiliated with the federal DOGE service, with Ernst lamenting the “big, beautiful breakup” between Trump and Musk. But she said “we still are very committed to DOGE work in the United States Senate and in the House.”
In addition to her statements signaling a campaign announcement, Ernst is scheduled to hold her annual “Roast and Ride” fundraiser Oct. 11, and hired a campaign manager in June.
Ernst said “Republicans are going to rule the day” in the 2026 election cycle, calling for GOP voters to vote and keep Iowa Republicans in power. Iowa has an all-Republican federal delegation, in addition to a GOP trifecta at the Statehouse.
“This is going to be a very big election year for us coming up in this next year,” Ernst told the Westside Conservative Club members. “So I am asking all of you, turn out, turn out, turn out. … After all of those choices have been made through the Republican primary, then we all come together as Iowa and support our Republican candidates, and we turn out in November, and we put the Democrats in their place. Because, let me tell you, I got a lot of years under my belt, and I’ve got a lot of confidence, not just in me, but all of our candidates up and down the ticket.”

Tim Walz on Wednesday announced that Eric Taubel will serve as executive director of the Office of Cannabis Management. He’s been serving in the role in an interim capacity for eight months.
Taubel is overseeing what’s been a sluggish cannabis market rollout after the Legislature legalized adult-use cannabis in 2023. The Office of Cannabis Management is currently issuing licenses to marijuana businesses and, as of Aug. 6, it had issued 10 microbusiness licenses, with nearly 1,100 preliminarily approved. Microbusinesses can grow and sell marijuana products.
Tribal nations including Red Lake and White Earth moved quickly set up their own cannabis operations to serve the new legal market.
Minnesota dispensaries can only sell cannabis grown within the state, so the supply chain will likely take a while to develop, the Star Tribune reported. At a cannabis conference last month, Taubel said that he expects a “more realized model of the market” to take effect in early 2026, the Strib reported.
Taubel previously served as the Office of Cannabis Management’s general counsel and was also general counsel for the Department of Education.
“Under his experienced leadership, I am confident that OCM and the Minnesota cannabis industry will continue to prioritize public health and safety, consumer confidence and market integrity,” Walz said in a statement Wednesday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-13 17:52:59+00:00,CT Mirror,Kosta Diamantis trial witness list includes many former CT officials,Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/kosta-diamantis-witness-list/,The witness list in Kosta Diamantis' trial on corruption charges includes state employees and people from major CT construction companies.,"The witness lists have been finalized and attorneys are preparing for jury selection in a federal criminal case against Konstantinos Diamantis involving alleged extortion, bribery and fraud within Connecticut school construction projects.
Federal prosecutors filed a list in court this week of more than 40 potential witnesses who could testify in the criminal trial of Diamantis, a former state deputy budget director who is accused of using his position overseeing the state’s school building office to solicit bribes from construction contractors.
That witness list includes several current and former members of Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, including Josh Geballe, the former commissioner of the state’s Department of Administrative Services, as well as the state employees who worked under Diamantis at the state’s Office of School Construction Grants and Review. 
The list does not name Melissa McCaw, the former secretary of the Office of Policy and Management who moved Diamantis and the school construction grant program from the Department of Administrative Services to OPM, where he became her deputy commissioner.  
When she resigned in February 2022, Lamont and others emphasized that McCaw was leaving voluntarily, not due to the FBI investigation of programs that had been overseen by Diamantis. 
The witness list also includes employees from some of the largest construction and architectural firms in Connecticut, including officials from Arcadis, O&G Industries, Downes Construction, Newfield Construction, Construction Solutions Group and D’Amato Construction.
The high-profile criminal trial, which is currently scheduled to begin on Oct. 6, is likely to dredge up a scandal that shook up the Lamont administration in late 2021 and shadowed the Democratic governor as he campaigned for a second term in 2022.
Lamont removed Diamantis from his post as a deputy budget director shortly after the state received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in 2021 seeking information about Diamantis and a host of projects and companies he was involved with. And Diamantis stepped down from his job overseeing the state’s school construction office shortly after.
Even so, people’s opinions about Lamont and his administration could play a key role in the upcoming trial due to Diamantis’ former position within the highest levels of the state government. 
Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, has asked the federal judge overseeing the trial to allow him to specifically question the potential jurors about their views on Lamont, who is now serving his second term as governor.
“Of course people’s attitude toward the governor might impact whether they can be on the jury,” Pattis said. “At the center of this case are several senior administrative officials.”
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to comment on the upcoming trial. 
Lamont’s office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the proposed witness list. 
Federal prosecutors spent several years investigating Diamantis before he was officially charged in May 2024 with 22 counts of extortion, bribery, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators. 
The charges leveled against Diamantis in the indictment focused almost exclusively on his interactions with two school construction contractors: Acranom Masonry and Construction Advocacy Professionals. Three executives from those companies — Salvatore Monarca, John Duffy and Antonietta Roy — have already pleaded guilty to bribing Diamantis, and all of them are likely to take the stand in the upcoming trial.
The lengthy witness list, however, shows that the trial could delve into far more than the conversations that took place between Diamantis and those three executives. 
The U.S. Attorneys office, for instance, said it could place Diamantis’ daughter, Anastasia, under oath during the trial. According to federal prosecutors, Roy, the owner of Construction Advocacy Professionals, allegedly hired Anastasia Diamantis in return for Kosta Diamantis’ help winning her contracts on school construction projects.
Prosecutors may also call to the witness stand several municipal officials who worked alongside Diamantis. That includes Hartford’s former city engineer, Frank Dellaripa, and Walter Willett, Tolland’s superintendent who publicly accused Diamantis of pressuring town officials to hire specific contractors on the Birch Grove Elementary project.
Meanwhile, Diamantis has announced several prominent witnesses of his own, including former Connecticut State Police Colonel Stavros Mellekas, former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and Hartford’s former school superintendent Leslie Torres-Rodríguez. 
Pattis said Diamantis is looking forward to the two-week trial and clearing his name.
“Mr. Diamantis has been held hostage by these accusations for a long time,” Pattis said. “The relationships in Hartford are a smoldering dung heap, and we are looking forward to shedding some sunlight and disinfectant on how the state does business.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_068-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

Avelo Airlines does not operate deportation flights out of Connecticut.
The budget carrier’s ICE deportation shuttle contract is based in Mesa, Arizona, under an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that began in May 2025. None of these flights depart from Connecticut, but the arrangement has prompted local government action. In New Haven, home to Avelo’s East Coast hub at Tweed New Haven Airport, the city has prohibited city employees, grant recipients, and contractors from using public funds to buy tickets from the airline while it continues the ICE charters. 
Several other cities in the region have taken similar steps. Avelo carried 94.64% of Tweed’s commercial passenger traffic between May 2024 and April 2025, compared with Breeze Airways at 5.36%, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data. The airline says the contract helps keep the business financially stable and protects jobs.

There’s some more argle-bargle details, but the long and short of it is he admits to shooting the Hoffmans.  
Blaze treats this like an entirely normal claim, that someone without any experience or expertise would use his job at mortuaries to conduct an “investigation” into a widely used vaccine that saved millions of lives. 
The publication doesn’t challenge any of it, except when one of the mortuaries where Boelter worked says, “The assertion in question is wholly unfounded, as no such investigation ever occurred.” 
Notably, a postscript says the quote from Wulff Funeral Home came after publication, probably when the mortuary sent a “WTH?!” email and someone at Blaze was savvy enough to see the risk of a defamation lawsuit and added the quote.
When asked about the Hortman killings, Boelter suddenly clams up and claims he can’t talk because of the ongoing criminal case. (Blaze fails to point out that this makes no sense — why can he talk openly about one criminal case but not the other?) 
Then they let him play to the foolish mythologies of their readership with fictional claims about the COVID vaccines: “I also think about the hundreds of other Minnesota citizens that have died in the last several years that have not been talked about but should have.”
They just let it hang there, giving legitimacy to the nonsense. 
Blaze also fails to mention the lengthy list of targets — Democratic officials and abortion providers — that investigators say was in Boelter’s car. The word abortion never appears in the piece.  
Either Boelter is mentally incompetent or perhaps he is propagating propaganda that will justify and even valorize his evil acts in hopes of persuading one right-wing juror to vote for acquittal. (Or persuading a morally bankrupt president for a pardon.) 
If it’s the former and he’s suffering a psychotic break from reality, quoting him is unethical: You don’t quote someone who is mentally unfit and detached from reality. 
If it’s the latter, you’re participating in his evil charade.
Of course, there’s another possibility: The reporter and editors of Blaze believe Boelter’s claims, that the vaccine is deadly and he was heroically investigating it. 
Which would help us understand the state of right-wing media: So high on their own supply that they’re eagerly willing to give a platform to an accused killer. 
You might be thinking, come on, it’s Blaze. We know what they’re all about. But setting aside their considerable influence — BlazeTV had 450,000 subscribers paying on average $102 a year, Axios reported in 2020 — there’s a lesson here for mainstream media chasing an interview with Boelter or reporting on his now voluminous public comments. 
Even assuming he’s mentally competent, there’s nothing he can say that’s worth printing, unless and until he’s willing to explain who radicalized him — and, thus, who should share in the responsibility for his alleged crimes.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/boelter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

Hill-Lilly was nominated by Gov. Ned Lamont to be DCF Commissioner and underwent confirmation hearings last year. 
Her departure comes at a time when the state is still waiting for another role key to child welfare — leading the state’s office of the child advocate — to be filled. OCA has not seen a permanent replacement since Sarah Eagan resigned more than a year ago.
Hill-Lilly was the second Black commissioner of the agency, following the departure last year of Vannessa Dorantes, who was the first. Hill-Lilly had previously served as deputy commissioner of DCF.
DCF is the agency charged with managing the care of thousands of children who enter the foster system. It also oversees programs that provide mental health care for kids and investigates reports of child abuse and neglect.
“Over the past 18 months, I was reminded daily of the critical role we all play in the lives of children. While there is still much work ahead, I’m proud of the work we have done together in the system,” Hill-Lilly said in a statement. “… As I step into this national role, I do so with hope and urgency, knowing our most vulnerable need us now more than ever. My roots and my heart will always be in the great State of Connecticut.”
In a press release, Lamont praised Hill-Lilly for her work over the past 37 years at DCF, beginning as a case management social worker.
“Jodi is one of the hardest working and most compassionate people I know, and her service to our state has absolutely made a positive impact on the lives of our youngest and most vulnerable residents,” Lamont said in the release. “Jodi truly stands as an example of what it means to serve the public and care about your community and its future, which is why I am not at all surprised that a nationwide child advocacy organization saw her talents and asked her to join their team.”
Hill-Lilly will become the director of the Child Well-Being Program at the Doris Duke Foundation, which works to “build a more creative, equitable and sustainable future by investing in artists and the performing arts, environmental conservation, medical research, child well-being and greater mutual understanding among diverse communities.”
In a statement, the legislature’s Committee on Children co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, wished Hill-Lilly the best.
“Her national recognition for her detailed, meaningful approach to this work reflects the care and compassion she has shown throughout her time at DCF,” Maher’s statement said.
Ahead of taking on the role of commissioner, Hill-Lilly oversaw the department’s administrative functions such as human resources, the Academy for Workforce Development and fiscal services, among other areas.
She has also served on the faculty for the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute and as vice president of the National Staff Development Training Association. She led DCF’s initiative on racial justice.
During her time as commissioner, Hill-Lilly has said she was focused on mental health services and helping families recover after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I will listen, I will learn, I will partner and I will act,” she said during her confirmation process. “My ultimate goal is to continue the great work started and go a little deeper. We will remain responsive to the emergent needs, particularly post-pandemic.”
Under her leadership, DCF has launched enhancements to the Specialized, Trauma-Informed, Treatment, Assessment and Reunification homes, or STTAR homes. The agency announced enhancements to the emergency shelters for kids, including the opening of two new treatment centers, after highly publicized reports of abuse and neglect at one home in Harwinton.
During Hill-Lilly’s tenure, the agency has also launched a new case management software system after years of using an outdated program.
Hill-Lilly is the second DCF commissioner to serve under Lamont’s administration. Her predecessor, Vannessa Dorantes left the agency at the beginning of 2024 after being appointed commissioner in 2019, at the start of Lamont’s first term.
Hill-Lily’s announcement comes just a couple of months after DCF Deputy Commissioner Michael Williams left the agency for a new role in Oklahoma child welfare.
Hill-Lilly earns about $250,000 annually, according to state records.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_0216_SR_DCFCommissioner_012-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

Nessel joined the lawsuit to block the data from being shared, a process that has been preliminarily halted by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
“I am relieved that the Court has recognized that the Trump Administration cannot abandon longstanding policies to personal healthcare data to advance a political agenda,” Nessel said in a statement. “Medicaid exists to serve the needs of some of our most vulnerable residents, not to provide unrelated agencies access to some of our most sensitive information. I will continue to fight to ensure Michiganders’ medical data remains protected and confidential.”
The court said the two federal agencies did not reasonably show its work when deciding to upend longstanding policy that prohibited the health and human services department from sharing information with homeland security for the purpose of immigration enforcement.
In its order, the court also said the agencies failed to consider a limit on the scope of the data provided, and instead moved forward with a plan to provide all private medical data for millions of Medicaid recipients.
The agencies are barred from sharing the data until the lawsuit’s conclusion or 14 days after both departments have completed a reasoned decision making process or rulemaking weighing policy tradeoffs and associated legal decisions.

(Photo by Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder)Public health workers and gun safety advocates gathered at a rally Tuesday night to commemorate last week’s deadly shooting near Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and demand policy changes to prevent future instances of gun violence.
At the entrance to the CDC, members of the community piled flowers, balloons and stuffed animals alongside signs thanking CDC workers and DeKalb County police Officer David Rose, who was killed in the shooting.
Down the street at Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health, leading voices in epidemiology, pediatric health, and violence prevention took the stage in a packed auditorium to describe what they saw as a “culture of misinformation” that contributed to Friday’s attack. The rally was organized by Georgia Majority for Gun Safety and Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety.
“Georgia is among the bottom third of state gun violence rates in a country that is doing poorly across developed nations,” said Heather Hallett, the founder and director of Georgia Majority for Gun Safety. “So we are really in a unique position in terms of the way gun violence impacts us.”
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was “deeply saddened” by the shooting, and visited the CDC campus Monday to meet with agency leadership and survey the damage.
“We are actively supporting CDC staff on the ground and across the agency,” he wrote in a post on X, adding “We honor their service. We stand with them. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.”
But public health advocates — including former employees of the CDC — point to a rise in public mistrust of vaccines they say is fueled by Kennedy’s rhetoric and policy decisions on vaccines. Earlier this year, he dismissed all 17 members of a key vaccine panel at the CDC and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics. The panel later voted to ban thimerosal, a harmless preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, in what critics say is a nod to vaccine skeptics who have fixated on the chemical’s use.
Vaccines
Last week, Kennedy terminated 22 grants — including one at Emory University — as part of a “coordinated wind-down” of research studying mRNA vaccine technology. Vaccines using mRNA were first developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the technology won a Nobel Prize in 2023.
Dr. Ben Lopman, an epidemiologist and former CDC employee who studies vaccines, said at Tuesday’s rally that misinformation about vaccines “has reached the highest levels in our government and society” under the current administration.
“RFK Jr. was arguably the nation’s leading anti-vaccine activist before being elevated to HHS secretary,” Lopman said. “These wrong ideas are now embedded in everyday conversations, as well as official policy.”
Dr. Sofia Chaudhary, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and an assistant professor at Emory University, also drew a link between mistrust of public health workers and Friday’s attack on the CDC.
“This past Friday, more than 180 bullets were fired, but the attack on public health went beyond the gunfire,” Chaudhary said. “Misinformation is a serious and growing threat to public health that leads to erosion of trust, delays in care and vaccinations, and deepening of social division.”
Speakers at the rally also condemned inaction on gun safety legislation at Georgia’s state Capitol. During the 2025 legislative session, legislators introduced a number of bills aimed at improving gun safety, but did not  pass any of them before the session concluded. Lawmakers will return to Atlanta in January.
“There are over a dozen bills held in limbo in committee at our state Capitol that use evidence-based solutions to address gun violence,” said Mike Greenwald, a doctor and co-chair of Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety.
Lawmakers “are aware of the evidence and the arguments,” he added. “What holds them back is likely a political calculus.”
Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety and Georgia Majority for Gun Safety will launch a new public information campaign on gun safety next month, Greenwald said.

(Courtesy of Democracy Maine)Democracy Maine Executive Director Anna Kellar is leaving the role after nearly eight years to serve as national organizing director for Rank the Vote, a nonprofit with the goal of adopting ranked-choice voting nationwide. 
Kellar’s last day will be Sept. 12. Al Cleveland, the organizations’ advocacy director, will serve as interim executive director until a permanent replacement is selected. 
In many ways, Kellar’s next role will continue the work they championed in Maine while leading Democracy Maine, which is a collaboration between nonpartisan organizations — the League of Women Voters of Maine, Maine Citizens for Clean Elections and Maine Students Vote — working to make government more equitable by improving elections, protecting and engaging voters. 
During their tenure, Kellar successfully pushed for the adoption of ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates by preference, at multiple levels of office. 
In November 2016, Maine voters approved ranked-choice voting for statewide elections for governor, state legislature and Congress — though applicability for some of those offices was later narrowed to only primaries — becoming the first state to do so. Kellar then led Democracy Maine in pushing for the Maine Legislature to expand the system to include presidential elections. At the municipal level, Kellar helped pass ranked-choice voting in Westbrook and expand it in Portland. 
“In this new role, I will bring the values that I learned through my time at Democracy Maine and the League to a national reform effort, especially the power of ordinary people working together to make our communities better,” Kellar said in a statement announcing their resignation Wednesday. “I am excited to help other states and cities follow Maine’s lead and embrace election systems that increase the choices and power of the voters.”
Beyond ranked-choice voting, Democracy Maine under Kellar’s leadership supported other successful legislative efforts to expand voting rights, including automatic voter registration, online voter registration, ongoing absentee and protections for absentee voting and having semi-open primaries. Kellar also aided in creating the state’s first municipal clean elections system in Portland.
Democracy Maine also expanded during Kellar’s tenure, notably with the addition of Maine Students Vote, which is aimed at increasing election engagement and civic participation on college campuses and high schools across the state. 
Jill Ward, the League’s and Democracy Maine’s board president, said in a statement that Kellar has positioned the organization well to “continue to lead the charge for a government truly of, by, and for everyday people.” 
Such efforts this fall will be centered on defeating Question 1 on the upcoming November ballot to require voters to show photo identification at the polls and make other changes to state election law, including limiting absentee voting. Democracy Maine also plans to continue to try to expand ranked-choice voting for the 2026 general election.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0471-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

Immigrants released at the border are being targeted for arrest when they show up for court hearings (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images).Inside immigration courts around the country, immigrants who crossed the border illegally and were caught and released are required to appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing.
But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.
Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

King Women’s Center in Salt Lake City on March 26, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Though Utah’s rate of homelessness remains below the national average, a new report shows the state’s homeless population is continuing to rise — and the start of 2025 marked a significant uptick.
“It’s a big jump,” Wayne Niederhauser, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox’s state homeless coordinator, told Utah News Dispatch ahead of the report’s release Wednesday. “We haven’t seen that kind of jump for years.”
The annual 2025 Point-in-Time Count — which is a national tally of sheltered and unsheltered people on a single night in January — showed 4,584 Utahns were experiencing homelessness in January 2025, up by 715 people from last year, an 18% increase.
Utah’s homelessness rate is now 13 per 10,000 people, up from 11 per 10,000. But even though Utah is one of the fastest-growing states in the nation and has faced skyrocketing housing prices over the past five years, its rate of homelessness is still well below the 2024 national rate, which was 23 per 10,000.
Though Niederhauser said it’s concerning to see an 18% jump, he said there is a “silver lining.”
“The silver lining is that 95% of those extra individuals were in shelter and not unsheltered,” he said.
Summer shouldn’t push Idaho’s working parents to the brink of homelessness

In the past several years, Niederhauser said Utah has typically seen only a 4% or 5% rate increase, but about 80% of those people were unsheltered. This year, he said, “the good part about that data point is that most of those individuals were sheltered.”
Of the 715 additional people experiencing homelessness during the 2025 Point-in-Time Count, 677 (95%) were sheltered and 38 (5%) were unsheltered, which the Utah Office of Homeless Services described in the report’s key findings as a “dramatic shift” from 2024, when that year’s count rose by 131 people, but only 23 (18%) were sheltered while 108 (82%) were unsheltered.
“This year’s dramatic increase in sheltered individuals compared to unsheltered is largely attributed to the expansion of winter shelter capacity, which allowed more individuals experiencing homelessness to access shelter,” the report says.
 Utah’s 2025 Point-in-Time-Count offers several findings

This year’s Point-in-Time Count took place during Code Blue temperatures, which prompted expansion of shelter capacity. Volunteers also questioned whether increased anti-camping enforcement, along with the frigid temperatures, could have factored into seeing fewer people on the streets.
The report also includes several other notable findings, including:

Rising child homelessness: The number of Utah children experiencing homelessness increased from 589 to 662, a 22% increase. Children now make up 14% of Utah’s total Point-in-Time Count, which is still below 2024 national data, when children accounted for 19% of people experiencing homelessness across the U.S.
More unhoused seniors: The number of Utahns over the age of 64 experiencing homelessness rose from 251 to 356, an increase of 42%. The increase, state officials wrote, “may reflect broader demographic shifts,” with Utah’s population of those 65 and older growing by nearly 58% from 2013 to 2023 and expected to double by 2060, according to the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. But at the same time, “more seniors are being priced out of housing, often living on fixed incomes that can’t keep pace with rising rents and property costs,” state officials wrote.
Veterans experiencing homelessness: The number of veterans experiencing homelessness grew by 36%, rising from 121 to 165. “While this represents a notable year-over-year increase, the 2025 total remains within the historical range, falling between the 2023 count of 181 and the 2022 count of 155.
A rise in first-time homelessness: Factoring in not just people tallied during the Point-in-Time Count, but also those who accessed homeless services according to the state’s database, a total of 10,261 people in Utah experienced homelessness in 2024 for the first time, an increase of 5% from 2023. The state’s homelessness data dashboard shows 5,122 people were categorized as “previously homeless,” only a slight uptick from 4,942 people in 2023. In total, the state’s database reported 15,383 people accessing services in 2024 statewide.

To Niederhauser, the report shows even though Utah homelessness is rising — following a national trend of Americans faced with higher housing costs, inflation, and wages that aren’t keeping pace with cost of living — the state’s homeless system is providing options that those additional people are using rather than living on the streets.
“There’s an increase in homelessness, but we’re addressing it in an effective way,” he said.
In the report’s executive summary, Niederhauser highlighted a list of investments the 2025 Utah Legislature made to improve Utah’s homeless system, including:

$3.9 million in ongoing funding to launch and operate a second family shelter in the Salt Lake Valley. Renovated from a Motel 6, the Family Interim Non-Congregate Housing Facility, or FINCH for short, opened in April.
$5.5 million in one-time funding was allocated for the 2026 fiscal year to expand emergency shelter operations during cold weather. In the 2025 fiscal year, investment in winter response supported 901 additional winter shelter beds, including 256 Code Blue beds and 3,370 emergency shelter nights provided in a hotel setting.
$16.7 million in ongoing, annually adjusted funding was distributed to cities hosting homeless shelters to help mitigate their impacts.

 What’s working and where are more resources for people facing homelessness needed?

The report showed some progress toward the state homeless system’s goals of making homelessness “rare, brief and nonrecurring,” but also areas where the system is falling short.
For example, state data showed a slight decrease in the number of days people are staying in emergency shelters. In 2024, 75% of emergency shelter stays were 90 days or less, down from 80% in 2023 and below previous years.
“While this trend indicates people are experiencing homelessness for longer periods of time, most only need short-term shelter support before restabilizing,” the report stays.
However, the average length of stay in emergency shelter increased by 10 days (17%) compared to 2023, “highlighting the growing difficulty individuals face in securing stable housing,” the report says. “This trend underscores the urgent need for faster housing placements and a broader range of exit options from shelter.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The number of Utahns experiencing chronic homelessness also remains an issue. According to the 2025 Point-in-Time Count, 1,233 were experiencing chronic homelessness — a 36% rise from 906 in 2024. But that group represented 27% of the total Point-in-Time Count, similar to 28% in 2023.
“This highlights the continued need for supportive services for individuals with disabilities and long histories of homelessness, while also confirming that chronic homelessness remains a minority of the overall homeless population in Utah,” the report says.
The report also showed, however, that supportive housing has continued to be a “key driver of long-term stability” for people exiting homelessness. For example, state data shows:

93% of people in permanent supportive housing “either retained their housing or moved on to other permanent options.” 2024 marked the “fourth consecutive year this success rate has held steady.”
In 2024, the percentage of people returning to homelessness within two years of exiting to permanent supportive housing declined slightly from 25% to 24%.
“These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of permanent supportive housing with wrap-around services in keeping Utah’s most vulnerable residents stably housed,” the report said.

In recent years, while lawmakers have put more money toward homeless services than they have in the past, there are still plenty of requests for more money that have gone unfunded. In 2025, lawmakers approved some but not all of the funding requests Niederhauser and his office asked for, leaving funding gaps that local officials have had to find ways to fill.

As his office prepares for another budget proposal, Niederhauser said his message to lawmakers for the upcoming 2026 general session in January is to acknowledge Utah’s homeless population is increasing. He also noted that the data shows the length of time people are staying in shelters has increased, indicating there’s a “gap” that needs to be filled when it comes to providing options for people to cycle out of emergency shelters.
“That’s the service that we really need to focus on,” he said, including additional beds at the Utah State Hospital or expanding capacity in other areas of the state’s mental health system, as well as increasing capacity for supportive housing.
“That is a good message for all of us, and it’s a good takeaway for the Legislature — for us to really focus on that big gap that we have for some of those services,” Niederhauser said. “If those are available, then the nights (people) spend in shelter goes down.”
For the first time, Utah’s Point-in-Time Count this year also included survey questions asking unsheltered people what type of shelter they would use if available. Its findings said:

610 preferred private rooms
568 preferred “bring-your-own setups (cars, tents, RVs) with shared facilities”
511 said they would use small units with shared bathrooms
356 were open to congregate shelters
236 said none of the above.

Niederhauser said that survey “confirms” what state and local leaders have been hearing for a long time – that providing a range of options for people will help keep more people off of the streets. He pointed to the 50-bed “microshelter” community that opened last fall as a model that’s been a success, with plans to add another 54 units in coming months.
“That kind of model we’re very bullish on because the outcomes have been excellent,” Niederhauser said.
He also said those survey questions are expected to inform the design of a planned 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus, which is expected to offer both congregate and non-congregate shelter options.
 Efforts to site 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus in SLC still underway

Lawmakers also passed legislation to allow the state to use eminent domain powers to “accelerate site acquisition” for a planned “transformative homeless services campus, with statutory authority limited to a defined area in Salt Lake City, northeast of the airport,” the report’s executive summary said.
Niederhauser and other state officials have been working for months to site that homeless campus (expected to include 1,200 to 1,600 beds), but they have not yet announced what properties they’ve been eying. Last fall, the Utah Homeless Services Board set a deadline of Oct. 1, 2025 for the campus to be built, but Niederhauser said the siting process has been taking longer than expected.
“Our timeline is ASAP,” Niederhauser said when asked about a new timeline for selecting the property for the homeless campus. “We know this is needed. We are looking at several properties, all of which have some difficult situations to overcome, like wetlands. I’ll highlight wetlands, because wetlands isn’t something I can solve in two weeks, three months, or even six months because the Army Corps of Engineers has to be involved in that, and there’s a process you have to go through.”
Depending on the outcomes of those evaluations, Niederhauser said that will determine whether state officials move forward with eminent domain powers to site the campus. He said a new timeline is not yet clear, but “we’re not sitting on this.”
“We are working hard,” he said, adding that it’s been challenging to find a property along the Wasatch Front, which has limited property available that hasn’t already been developed. “Unfortunately, you know, the need is huge. We appreciate the acute need, the serious need of this. So we’re not letting grass grow under our feet. We’re working hard to find a pathway.”

(Photo by Eros Hoagland/Getty Images)It’s move-in week for students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as thousands of freshmen and returning students arrive and settle into their new campus home. The university is welcoming its biggest class of undergraduates yet. More than 5,100 are first-year students, representing 98 North Carolina counties and 80 foreign countries. Almost 1 in 5 (18.3%) of the incoming undergrads are first-generation college students.
Chancellor Lee Roberts shared the numbers last week as he addressed the UNC-Chapel Hill Employee Forum ahead of the new semester. But overshadowing those positive numbers was another much larger figure — 70 million — that had everyone in the room nervous.
A week earlier, university leaders announced plans to cut $70 million from the budget to address federal funding cuts and uncertainty from the state government budget.

While the university is still sorting out where to make cuts, a $39 million reduction in nonresident financial aid can be expected.
“We’ll be scaling back our nonresident financial aid, continue to prioritize North Carolinians in the provision of our financial aid dollars,” said Roberts. “We’re going to reduce some funding from our centers and institutes. It’s about a 10% cut from centers and institutes.”
The chancellor worked to reassure university employees that these decisions were not being made in isolation.
“I spent the first 10 or so years working at a big bank and we always did it that way. And the drawback to that is that there is no consultation, there’s no input from the organization,” said Robert. “The second way of doing it is the way that we’re doing it, which is to announce our targets, to announce the way that we’re thinking about the reductions. But without all of the details yet finalized.”
But even without a finalized plan, Roberts said they fully envisioned some employees would be cut.
“We don’t know how many layoffs we’re talking about because we haven’t gotten that far in the process yet. But it would be unrealistic to go through an exercise like this and not expect there to be some layoffs.” said Roberts, who hoped that attrition could ease the pain.










We're trying to think about some centers and institutes that were established to serve a purpose, that may or may not any longer be relevant. Centers and institutes tend to have a lifecycle.


– UNC Chancellor Lee Roberts


Natasha Young, the assistant director of leadership development at UNC-Chapel Hill, asked what budget analysis had been done based on salaries, hoping that smaller pay reductions could offset layoffs.
“If you make over $500,000 a year on campus and see a 5% pay reduction, my assumption is that you probably won’t have drastic implications on your quality of life. If you’re an employee that makes $50,000 a year and you get laid off, you risk homelessness, not being able to feed your children, losing your healthcare, all of that,” she reasoned.
Roberts said there are relatively few employees making over $500,000 a year on campus.
“There are 70 on campus,” Young answered.
“A lot of them are going to be in the health system,” Roberts reassured.
“And athletics,” Young responded.
Roberts, a former state budget director, said the university cannot impose pay cuts on state employees.
“It’s just not the way the state employment laws work.”
Keith Hines from the UNC’s Development Department wanted clarification on what constitutes a center and an institute that might be subject to being cut.
Roberts said in this case the 10% suggested cut would not be applied evenly to those organizations.
“We’re trying to think about some centers and institutes that were established to serve a purpose, that may or may not any longer be relevant,” Roberts said. “Centers and institutes tend to have a lifecycle. And that’s what we’re trying to look at.”
The state legislature’s latest mini-budgets did not include funds for the University’s enrollment growth, or an increase in sports wagering revenue. 
  UNC’s ServiceFirst timeline
In May, the UNC Board of Trustees introduced ServiceFirst, a new initiative to identify operational efficiencies and strategic cost-savings for the campus.
Scott Savage, UNC-Chapel Hill’s associate vice chancellor for organizational strategy and performance, said his team will be looking at transactional work, what can be centralized, what work and resources can be shared.
It’s estimated another $3.9 million in savings can be realized by eliminating currently vacant roles.
“What the proposed operating models are drive a lot of those conversations whether it’s the adjustment of team placement, it’s staying the same, or it’s modifications to positions. But the how of doing that is still under development,” Savage told university employees.
ServiceFirst plans to implement its efficiency roadmap as early as November, according to Savage’s presentation to the group.
  Theresa Silsby, director of UNC’s ITS Business Systems
Theresa Silsby, director of UNC’s ITS Business Systems, said future cuts and even the decision to leave positions unfilled will have consequences.
“I purposely made the decision a couple years ago not to fill a position on my team. We support HR, finance and payroll, and all employees for Connect Carolina,” said Silsby, a 29-year-employee.
“What I found was while the work could get done, if anybody was sick or needed a vacation, we were dead in the water.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1271725146-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The Montana Republican Party announced on Wednesday that Tyler Newcombe has resigned from his role as Executive Director, after serving in the position since the beginning of the year. He will be taking on a new role as communications director and advisor for State Auditor James Brown.
“It has been an incredible honor to work with such a dedicated team on advancing conservative values across Montana,” Newcombe said in a press release. “I’m proud of what we accomplished together and confident that the MTGOP is well-positioned for the future.”
The party plans to announce a new executive director in the coming weeks.
The party hired Newcombe in January to replace Danielle Bradley, who stepped down after leading the MTGOP through the 2022 and 2024 election cycles which turned Montana into a solidly red state, with Republicans winning every statewide office and sweeping the Congressional delegation for the first time in more than a century.
While overseeing the party’s work during the 2025 legislative session, Newcombe also broke fundraising records and “set the party on a path to more victories in the coming years,” according to the press release.
“I appreciate Tyler’s service to the Montana Republican Party and wish him the best in his future endeavors,” MTGOP Chairman Art Wittich said.
Newcombe officially stepped down last week, but stayed on in an unofficial capacity through the start of the transition period. In addition to his communications work in the Auditor’s office, Newcombe also works as a political consultant for many Montana Republicans.
“I’m excited to join the office of James Brown to highlight the work he does to defend Montanans from fraud, prosecute bad actors, and assist Montanans with proactively helping them with finding the best rates for their families,” Newcombe told the Daily Montanan.
In another change at the state party, Ethan Holmes has been brought on to serve as communications director to handle press affairs and as the primary point of contact for the party.
Holmes is a University of Montana graduate who worked in communications and as a legislative advisor for the Senate Republicans during the 2025 session.
“The MTGOP looks forward to delivering the conservative agenda mandated by voters, growing its grassroots base, and keeping Montana bright red,” according to the release.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250628_123801-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

Forest Service is said to be close to deciding on a property swap that would give Wyoming a site for a reservoir planned above Little Snake River Valley.
The post Wyoming advances land exchange for proposed West Fork Dam appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming water developers appear to be closing in on a land exchange between the state and the Medicine Bow National Forest to enable construction of a dam and reservoir above the Little Snake River Valley in Carbon County.
Wyoming lawmakers voted last Thursday to transfer $300,000 to the state land office to help complete a swap. The money would enable the Wyoming Office of Lands and Investments and the Forest Service to complete surveys, minerals reports and other elements necessary for the exchange, Wyoming Water Development Office Director Jason Mead told lawmakers.
A land exchange, which has stirred public interest and opposition, is critical to the proposed dam and reservoir. “In order to get our permits, we have to acquire that U.S. Forest Service property,” Mead told lawmakers.
A motion to approve the transfer passed without dissent at a joint meeting of the Legislature’s Select Water Committee and Wyoming Water Development Commission last week. The money comes from $4.2 million already allocated to the water office for the proposed dam on the West Fork of Battle Creek.
 “If they can consolidate … there’s potential[ly] more revenue to state lands for schools.” Jason Mead
Medicine Bow forest officials appear ready to sign and approve a feasibility analysis and public interest determination that could move the exchange forward, Mead told lawmakers.
“The land exchange process has gone through a feasibility analysis to make sure it can be completed through the Forest Service regulations and if it’s in the public interest,” Mead said. “That, I think, currently is awaiting signature.”
The signing of a report affirming the feasibility and public interest of an exchange would advance the process, Mead said. “The next step would be an ‘agreement to initiate’ … a 64-step process, literally to complete that land exchange.”
As the effort advances, forest officials cautioned that tasks so far represent “preliminary steps.” The Forest Service, after consultation with officials in Washington, D.C., stated in an email that it “has not approved or completed a land exchange,” and that “the process is in early stages and subject to further analysis and public review.”
A draft Environmental Impact Statement on the project, announced in 2022, is expected to be published early next year by the federal Natural Resources Conservation Service.
More irrigation in troubled basin
The West Fork dam is proposed to be a 264-foot-high, 700-foot-long concrete plug in a canyon just south of scenic Wyoming Highway 70 between Saratoga and Baggs. The reservoir would be about 130 acres and cover what is now largely forested land. About 44 irrigators have expressed interest in contracting for late-season water from the planned reservoir. In 2017, water developers estimated the dam would cost $80 million and hold 8,000 acre feet.
The drainage is in the Colorado River Basin, where states are scrambling to agree on new methods to share water in the face of climate change, over-promised supplies and dwindling flows. Wyoming believes it has not used its share of basin-wide water rights and is allowed to use more on hay and alfalfa fields.
To enable the dam’s construction, the state lands office proposed exchanging Wyoming school trust property for approximately 1,490 acres of National Forest land. The state lands office has identified “a number of state parcels,” Mead said.

“The majority of those [state] parcels that they’re looking to trade are actually in roadless areas — or what maybe used to be roadless areas,” Mead told lawmakers. “They’re very isolated parcels out in the middle of forest, and the access to them is very limited.
“So if they can consolidate those into this project location of West Fork Reservoir that has access from the highway,” Mead said, “there’s potential[ly] more revenue to state lands for schools.”
The exchange would have to be of properties that are of equal value, or nearly equal value, with a payment that would make up any difference.
Half of the $300,000 would be used by the state for its surveys and other work and the other half would go to the Medicine Bow for its share of the examinations.
Medicine Bow National Forest spokesman Aaron Voos in 2023 outlined his agency’s exchange process. “The feasibility analysis, report, and public interest are all inter-related,” he wrote. “That analysis will culminate in the report and public interest statement.”
“Input previously received … on the land exchange proposal has informed the feasibility analysis, and then subsequently the report/public interest statement,” Voos wrote in 2023. The Forest Service will not take more public input before releasing the analysis and public interest report, he wrote at the time.
What is the public’s interest?
It’s uncertain what elements the Forest Service has considered in determining public interest.
“There is some flexibility in how the report can be written and how ‘public interest’ is explained throughout the report,” Voos has explained in emails. “Regardless, ‘public interest’ is required to be addressed and will be heavily factored into the Forest Supervisor’s recommendation to proceed or not proceed.”
One gauge of public interest emerged when the Natural Resources Conservation Service announced in 2022 the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement that would examine the proposal. The agency received 936 comments, according to a WyoFile tally.
Dam proponents didn’t expect so much feedback. The state water office’s consultant assumed there would be 100 comments, “with only 40 being substantive.”
WyoFile’s count found 96% of commenters opposed to the West Fork plan. Many comments were simple statements of opposition.
The Forest Service will determine which comments will be considered in the public interest determination. That’s because federal agencies have a rule on what comments they consider. Only “substantive” comments are factored into the environmental impact process according to a primer on the procedure published by the Bureau of Land Management.
“Comments that are not substantive include: Comments in favor of or against an action without any reasoning (such as ‘I do/don’t like ____’ without providing any rationale),” the BLM primer states. In contrast, substantive comments “provide relevant and new information with sufficient detail,” the primer states.

Michigan superintendents in the Dearborn, Dexter, Harrison, and Huron Valley school districts are among the seven semifinalists for the state’s top education leader position.
The semifinalists for the state superintendent job also include Virginia’s former top education leader, a former Des Moines superintendent, and the head of a Michigan association of intermediate school district administrators.
Michigan’s State Board of Education chose the seven semi-finalists Tuesday after a closed session in which they reviewed 33 applications for the top job. They are seeking to replace State Superintendent Michael Rice, who announced in April that he is retiring, effective Oct. 3.
The semifinalists will be interviewed by the board in 90-minute sessions next week, on Aug. 18 and Aug. 19, during the first round of interviews. The board will then choose finalists, and the schedule includes making a final decision in early September.
Here are the seven people who will interview for the job:

Thomas Ahart, education consultant and coach, and former superintendent of the Des Moines Public Schools
Lisa Coons, former state superintendent in Virginia and former chief academic officer for the Tennessee Department of Education
Glenn Maleyko, superintendent, Dearborn Public Schools
Paul Salah, superintendent, Huron Valley Schools
John R Severson, executive director, Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators.
Christopher Timmis, superintendent, Dexter Public Schools
Judy Walton, superintendent and curriculum director, Harrison Community Schools

The seven semi-finalists were recommended by representatives of Hazard, Young, Attea & Associates, the search firm assisting the board.
Max McGee, an associate with the search firm, told the board the seven recommended are the candidates whose experiences and background best meet the 12 desired characteristics and qualifications that the firm developed based on what they heard in interviews with stakeholders, focus groups, forums, and survey results.
The board approved moving those seven recommended candidates to the first round of the interview process, with member Tom McMillin, a Republican from Oakland Township, the lone “no” vote among the eight members. McMillin had motioned to include an eighth candidate as a semifinalist, but that effort failed.
McMillin explained that his vote “doesn’t mean I oppose them all” and doesn’t mean he won’t eventually vote for one of them.
Fellow Republican Nikki Snyder, from Goodrich, voted to approve the semifinalists, but said the search process “has been inherently flawed.”
“I do believe the candidate has already been chosen,” Snyder said.
Marshall Bullock, a Democrat from Detroit, said he hasn’t chosen a candidate.
“I take some kind of dislike to that commentary that we’ve already selected a candidate. This is all very fresh to me,” Bullock said.
Earlier in Tuesday’s meeting, McGee read a list of 10 candidates for the job who had not requested confidentiality in releasing their names prior to interviews. None of them, however, were among the semifinalists. One of them was Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, a member of the Detroit Public Schools Community District board and former Michigan lawmaker and teacher.

As part of a training exercise for the Nebraska Army National Guard, soldiers will descend from Blackhawk helicopters near iconic Chimney Rock in the state’s Panhandle.
The two-hour-long training exercise is scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. Friday, weather permitting.
Soldiers from the 2-134th Infantry Battalion-Airborne will descend from two Blackhawk helicopters onto a designated drop zone between Chimney Rock and the Ethel S. and Christopher J. Abbott Museum and Visitors Center.
The public is invited to the event, which coincides with National Airborne Day. It’s no coincidence that the current director of the Nebraska State Historical Society, Daryl Bohac, is a former adjutant general of the Nebraska National Guard.
Chimney Rock State Historical Site Manager Loren Pospisil said in a statement the pioneer monument was “excited” to participate in this “history-in-the-making event.”
Officials said the exercise could be cancelled as late as Friday morning if weather conditions make it unsafe for the paratrooper’s 1,500-foot jump.

(Getty Images)Last month, Congress revived and expanded the program that offered payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing, meaning Utah’s downwinders can again apply for compensation.
For years, Intermountain’s Downwinder Clinic, located at the St. George Regional Hospital’s Cancer Center, has provided free help to downwinders — that includes education, health care assistance and help applying to receive payments through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA.
All of Idaho’s downwinders could be compensated under U.S. Senate’s mega bill

However, RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it.
In the 13 months after the program expired, the Downwinder Clinic was still working with eligible families to gather the documents needed to qualify for RECA payments. And last month, after Congress reauthorized RECA in its massive spending bill, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program are again eligible for compensation.
“We have been working with families during the 13 months the program was expired to help gather the documents they would need when RECA was reinstated. Now, we want people to know that the qualifying boundaries have expanded, as well as new applicants qualify for a larger compensation amount for the health issues they have encountered,” Barlow said.
RECA has been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was impacted by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.
Now, the program’s scope is much broader. All of Utah and Idaho is considered an affected area, meaning if you lived in the Beehive and Gem states for a period of 12 months between 1951 to 1962, and contracted a certain type of cancer, you are likely eligible for compensation.
Eligible cancers include leukemia (but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma, lymphomas and cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gall bladder, lung, and ovarian.
New applicants will also now receive $100,000 — the prior compensation amount was $50,000. However, that increase is not retroactive, meaning downwinders who already received payments are not eligible for the new amount.

If we are serious about supporting Vermonters, then we cannot ignore the public suffering that is impacting so many communities across our state. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak: Vermont’s municipalities are at a breaking point. We need state partnership now more than ever..","This commentary is by Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, of Burlington.


For years, the city of Burlington has worked hard to adapt our responses to public health challenges, including homelessness, substance use disorders and mental health crises. 
Camping and rough sleeping have been prevalent in city spaces for decades. However, since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Vermont has seen an alarming increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness. 
Over the past three years, uncertainty around the State Emergency Housing Program, also known as the motel program, has left the city and partner organizations in a near constant state of crisis-response. 
Vermont’s municipalities do not have the staff or resources to adequately respond to these overlapping challenges. The most recent round of motel exits on July 1 saw hundreds of people pushed out of the motel program statewide, including families with children, older adults and medically vulnerable individuals. 
Many who exited had nowhere to go.

Based on local data, while Chittenden County accounts for 26% of Vermont’s population, we hold 34% of the state’s residents sleeping unsheltered. This is a policy failure that has left vulnerable people and those trying to serve them in crisis. We need more residential treatment beds, more shelter capacity, stronger renter protections and more affordable housing — real solutions that we have collectively failed to achieve.
On July 24, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order: Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets. This executive order promotes forced institutionalization, prioritizes the criminalization of homelessness and deprioritizes funding for evidence-based public health responses. This executive order is not a mandate, and we will not treat it as such in Burlington. 
As Burlington’s mayor, let me be clear: We will continue to move forward with compassion, using evidence-based practices like housing first and harm reduction while also prioritizing public health and safety, and maintaining our public spaces for all to enjoy.
In Burlington, we have made progress in evolving our responses to public health challenges, including increased funding for embedded social support providers and clinicians within our police department, creation of the fire department’s community response team, continued support for the urban park ranger program, and an increased investment in Howard Center’s Street Outreach Team. 
Key staff across multiple departments meet weekly to identify encampments, remove them from city parks, and assess campsites on other city land for health and safety. 
We also recently launched the Situation Table, an international model for intensive case coordination with the goal of reducing relevant risk factors for individuals at a heightened risk of harm to themselves or others. Anonymized risk factor data is then recorded so that we can track interventions, measure the effectiveness of the Situation Table, and assess if services are successfully mitigating risks. 
This data helps inform the development of local policies and initiatives to address safety and can be used to advocate for additional resources. We are also preparing to launch the City Circle initiative, which will offer an immediate accountability process for individuals who violate local ordinances and employs a restorative justice approach. 
I am proud of these innovative initiatives, however, they are at best triage and harm reduction responses necessitated by our maxed-out and chronically underfunded system of care. 
As mayor, I and other municipal officials have pleaded with state leaders, hoping to impress upon them the impossible burden municipalities face when the state fails to take action. My office has coordinated with city councilors and department heads to send several letters to Gov. Phil Scott on this issue. 
I have personally met with Scott and Agency of Human Services leaders to request a truly collaborative statewide response. Homelessness, substance use disorders and mental health crises touch every Vermont community in some fashion. If we are serious about supporting Vermonters, then we cannot ignore the public suffering that is affecting so many communities across our state. 
Municipal officials have advocated repeatedly for a coordinated response by the Agency of Human Services, including expanded shelter capacity and treatment beds. These pleas have largely been met with inaction. Burlington remains a willing partner to Scott, other state leaders and service providers to identify and implement real solutions to homelessness and our housing crisis. 
The conversation around H.91 was a good start, but Scott vetoed that bill to the surprise of many legislators and without offering alternatives. H.91 would have allowed for a more regional approach to shelter and service provision, offering a bridge to more community based shelter capacity and away from motels. 
Our city team will continue to adapt within our capacity to respond to the unprecedented scale of unsheltered homelessness in our community. However, we cannot do this work alone. When we expend resources to fill gaps left by the state, we have less for other local services and have to make difficult decisions, as we did in the previous two municipal budget cycles. 
Finally, I ask people to combat the narrative that just because people do not have permanent housing, they pose an inherent risk to others. Now more than ever, it is imperative to maintain our collective empathy. 
I encourage Vermonters to reach out to Scott. We need help from his administration. The level of human suffering in our communities is unacceptable, and the financial costs are untenable.

Kelly Ayotte at the state’s Executive Council meeting.
Butler, a Democrat, defeated Republican Ken Hilton to represent the reliably Democratic Strafford County District 12, which includes Somersworth and Rollinsford. Evans, also a Democrat, had moved out of the district and resigned.
On the campaign trail, Butler, an active member of the Seacoast area theater community, stressed her support for the arts and said she wouldn’t take up divisive issues, telling Foster’s Daily Democrat she “would like to see more people run who do not have divisive agendas, but who really love New Hampshire.”
During Wednesday’s meeting, Ayotte also called for a special election for state representative in Coos County District 5, which includes Berlin. That seat has sat vacant since June, when Republican Brian Valerino resigned. Valerino, a former sheriff and deputy police chief, was nominated by Ayotte in May to be the Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility’s warden.
The candidate filing period will be Aug. 18 through Aug. 22, the governor announced. A primary election is scheduled for Sept. 16, with the special election being held Nov. 4.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas State Board of Education granted permission to the Blytheville School District to enter into the state’s second transformation contract during a special meeting Wednesday. 
A transformation contract allows a public school with a “D” or “F”-rating or one classified as in need of Level 5–Intensive Support to partner with an open-enrollment public charter school or another state-approved entity to create a “transformation campus.” The LEARNS Act, a 2023 law that overhauled the state’s K-12 education system, provides for the partnerships.
The state board dissolved the Blytheville School Board in May and placed the struggling eastern Arkansas district under a Level 5–Intensive Support classification due to ongoing academic, financial and administrative issues. The designation marks the highest level of state intervention or support.
Arkansas education board dissolves Blytheville school board

The Arkansas Department of Education issued a request for proposals in May to establish a transformation contract for the educational and administrative management of the district. 
ADE Deputy Commissioner Stacy Smith told the state board Wednesday that eight different groups showed interest and six completed the full application process. Four advanced to final interviews with a committee in Blytheville, which led Smith to recommend that the board allow the district to enter into a transformation contract with AMS Impact Group. 
The charter management organization manages the Academies of Math & Science in Little Rock and nine other schools in Arizona, according to the company’s website.
Smith said the committee felt the organization was committed to Blytheville and understanding the community. Prior to interviews, AMS representatives spent days living in the community and talking to residents at local restaurants, she said. 
“They were about one of the only groups who actually showed that they had a real interest, not just in running the school, but being part of the community,” Smith said. “They definitely sold themselves to the folks who were on the committee that day.”
AMS personnel have already been working with ADE staff in Blytheville. If a contract is approved, Smith said they’ll be responsible for the district’s daily operation, curriculum instructional support, direct support to personnel and professional development. The group has also brought in a “robust community engagement plan” that could include a community advisory board that would provide feedback on how the district was operating, she said.
“Transformation is beginning, but we have a long way to go in Blytheville,” Smith said.
After the board unanimously voted to allow Blytheville to enter into a transformation contract, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva noted the decision to dissolve the board was not done lightly and was the “culmination of a year’s worth of work trying to get things sorted.”
“This is a district that couldn’t even get a toilet to work,” Oliva said. “So when the expectation is that basic facilities can’t work, how can we expect students to learn?”
Over the last two months, Oliva said ADE staff and the community have made getting the first day of school right for students and families their top priority. The AMS team has also been onsite and meeting with families, and “the amount of excitement around Blytheville schools is contagious,” he said. 
“Students are telling teachers and administrators that they feel like this might be the first time that they actually learn something…this is such an exciting time, and we’re going to see monumental gains very quickly because we are now focused on students and not adults,” Oliva said.
The education board approved the state’s first transformation contract between the Marvell-Elaine School District and Friendship Education Foundation, a charter management company, in May 2023. 
The contract’s initial term was set for July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2026. The contract could be terminated early or extended. Under the agreement, the foundation would be compensated $50,000 for the transition term, which lasted until June 30, 2023, and $200,000 annually during the initial term.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

The donation, the first major contribution the team made in Missouri this year, comes roughly two months after the legislature approved a $1.5 billion stadium funding plan aimed at convincing the Chiefs and Royals to stay in Missouri.
Last year, the team spent more than $3 million supporting a ballot measure seeking to extend a three-eights-cent sales tax to finance a renovation of Arrowhead Stadium and the construction of a new downtown ballpark for the Royals. 
The Royals donated around $2.5 million to the effort, as well as $260,000 to various local political organizations. 
However, voters resoundingly rejected the extension of the sales tax.
Tuesday’s $25,000 check went to the House Republican Campaign Committee. The same day, the PAC received $30,000 from Missouri Soybean Association; $10,000 from Mo Medical PAC; and $5,500 from state Rep. Dean Van Schoiack.
The Chiefs and Royals have played in side-by-side stadiums for five decades and share a lease at the Truman Sports Complex that runs through Jan. 31, 2031. As the expiration date nears, legislators in Missouri and Kansas have battled to present the best financial framework to attract the teams to their respective sides of the state line. 
Missouri lawmakers approved legislation to allocate state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in either Jackson or Clay counties.
The cost is estimated at close to $1.5 billion over 30 years and could cover up to half the costs of stadium construction.
Two Republicans state legislators filed a lawsuit late last month asking a judge to declare the incentives package unconstitutional because it also includes provisions unrelated to stadium funding.
Kansas lawmakers have put a deal on the table that would use state incentives to pay for up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums. That deal originally expired June 30, but Chiefs President Mark Donovan successfully lobbied for the deadline to be extended in order to continue negotiations with Kansas on building a stadium, team headquarters, practice facility and related business developments.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020925Arrowhead4-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-13 12:59:07.884453

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week defunded research in messenger RNA vaccines, which could create a chilling effect that could jeopardize efforts to develop vaccines against breast cancer, experts said.
The government is cancelling almost $500 million in 22 research contracts previously granted through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a subsidiary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the agency will not initiate new grants for projects involving messenger RNA, the revolutionary basis for COVID-19 immunizations. The scientists who helped discover mRNA technology won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Medicine; no vaccine has ever been so quickly developed and produced as the COVID-19 vaccines.

This story was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Kennedy, who is known for his broad opposition to vaccines, said Health and Human Services is terminating the contracts because “these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections” — despite the broad medical consensus, backed by large studies, which holds that the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.
The government’s move has been widely decried by vaccine researchers, immunologists and public health experts. Some scientists have touted mRNA technology as a possible avenue to develop other vaccines, including ones to treat various cancers, including breast cancer, which is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide.
Cancer vaccines have been a rapid area of growth for medical research in recent years. Prophylactic vaccines, such as the human papillovirus vaccine, prevent cancers. But immunologists and cancer researchers have been working to develop new therapeutic vaccines — products that can trigger the immune system to fight against cancer cells after they have already developed, working instead as a treatment. There is a growing consensus that mRNA vaccines could be particularly effective in fighting cancers.
Most cancer vaccines currently in clinical trials are not based on mRNA. But it’s an area of growing interest: More than 120 clinical trials have been registered with the federal government to explore how mRNA vaccines could treat different cancers. Vaccines in development that make use of mRNA include those that could treat melanoma, lymphoma and colorectal cancer; scientists are also examining the possibility to treat pancreatic, lung and breast cancer.
The 22 contracts terminated were for treatments and vaccines for conditions such as influenza, COVID-19 and bird flu, not cancer. In its announcement, HHS said “other uses of mRNA technology” beyond prophylactic vaccines will not be affected.
But some cancer researchers still fear that Kennedy’s promise will cast a chill upon a promising line of inquiry, slowing progress and possibly preventing scientists from developing effective cancer treatments.
“There’s no question that the U.S. federal government has been one of the largest funders of biomedical research and innovation in the world,” said Dr. Herbert Kim Lyerly, an immunologist at Duke University.
Lyerly is part of a team currently working on a clinical trial for an RNA vaccine that could treat many common cancers, including breast cancer. So far, he said, the results have been promising. His work is government-supported but wasn’t affected by the recent cancellation of mRNA contracts.
Still, he believes the shift in policy could deter scientific innovation — if researchers can’t count on stable funding to explore mRNA-based options, it could prevent them from developing the most effective therapeutics.
“It reduces the options you have to explore strategies to reduce the burden of disease, to prevent disease, to improve the quality of life of people in this country,” he said. “To take away any of the tools to potentially have an impact is likely to limit progress.”
Others have echoed his concerns, including a spokesperson for the Biotechnology Innovation Center, who told the news organization STAT that scaling back government investments in mRNA vaccines “could erode progress and discourage investment in other promising areas of research, including cancer and rare diseases.” In a statement on the social media platform X, former surgeon general Jerome Adams, who served in President Donald Trump’s first term, called the move “dangerous,” highlighting its implications for flu, RSV, HIV, Zika, autoimmune diseases and cancer.
Still, some researchers said they anticipate that any vacuum created by the federal government’s retreat will be filled by other entities: foundations and nonprofits that focus on cancer.
“People are committed to mRNA because it has been shown to be safe and effective. People will still continue to do that research,” said Dr. Alison Stopeck, an oncologist at Stony Brook Cancer Center who focuses on breast cancer.
If the federal government does not support this kind of work, she added, “Foundations and donors will step in and provide some resources for this as well — because donors and foundations know how important this research is.”
Already, medical researchers have been left reeling after the federal government’s cancellation of major funding through institutions such as the National Institutes of Health — a move the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office recently deemed illegal. That’s been compounded by other funding cuts to individual research universities as well as a broader federal effort to curb funding into medical research that considers gender or gender inequality.
Though deaths from cancers have been declining, an April report from the National Cancer Institute found that the incidence of cancer actually increased for women over the past two decades. Breast cancer is also growing more common, particularly among young women and Asian American and Pacific Islander women. Black women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are substantially more likely to die than White women.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Hemp companies are asking for more consistency from state inspectors, who’ve spent the summer cracking down on packaging that could appeal to minors. 
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services proposed a state definition of what can be considered a “cartoon” on packaging for hemp products such as THC drinks, gummies, and more during a hearing Wednesday in Tallahassee. 
Under the initial proposed language, the state would define a cartoon as “any drawing or other depiction of an object, person, animal, creature, or any similar caricature” that uses “comically exaggerated features,” “attribution of human characteristics to animals, plants, or other objects, or the similar use of anthropomorphic technique,” or “the attribution of unnatural or extra-human abilities, such as imperviousness to pain or injury, X-ray vision, tunnelling at very high speeds, or transformation.”
The definition was taken from tobacco litigation discussing what could be considered attractive to children, the state said. 
State law prohibits hemp products from being “attractive to children” and already prohibits depicting the shape of humans, cartoons, or animals, as well as candy.

Call for consistency
During the hearing on the language Wednesday, hemp industry representatives called for consistency in enforcement. 
“What we’re asking for today are clear rules of the road and ways to check our work before we invest,” Bayou City Hemp Co. co-founder Jeromy Sherman said.
He added that the company’s production process takes six months or more. “Arbitrary, after-the-fact enforcement, especially when it’s trusted retailers in the state of Florida, creates a ripple effect that punishes the companies trying to play by the rules and rewards fly-by-night operators.”
Sherman asked the department for a pre-approval process from the department to determine what counts as a cartoon before the product goes into production, pointing out that some other states require pre-approval.
This summer, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and the department conducted “Operation Safe Summer,” whereby inspectors removed more than 800,000 packages of hemp products they considered to violate child-protection standards. 
The campaign was “not a one-time sweep,” either, Simpson said in a news release. The department will “aggressively pursue bad actors until the hemp industry gets the message.”
“We applaud those efforts and encourage further actions in that regard,” Sherman said. However, he asked for “consistency and clarity.”
The state should provide “Bright, yet workable, lines for compliance,” he said. 
Li Massie of Akerman LLP, representing hemp beverage companies, said investigators looking at the same product at different stores have come to different conclusions as to what is a cartoon, likening the process to a “gamble” for companies. 
“Too much discretion means that industry members are not able to properly plan ahead for compliance,” Massie said, noting the potential for First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment concerns. 
Patrick Shatzer, representing SunMed CBD, said there’s been “complete inconsistency” in inspections.
The department provided a 10-day extension for the public to submit comments. Next will come a proposed rule, followed by another opportunity for public feedback.

This year Washington, DC is the host city for the WorldPride 2025 celebration, a global celebration of the LGBTQ community that coincides with the 50th anniversary of the city’s first Pride parade; the three-week WorldPride festival has drawn thousands to events across the capital despite lingering concerns about LGBTQ rights under President Trump. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 ‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.
Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

“For the past six months, Corewell has been forcing Teamsters nurses to exhaust their accrued paid time off before allowing them to use unpaid leave for negotiation dates,” Mike Smith, lead negotiator and trustee of Local 2024, said in a statement. “This is another attempt to target and attack unionized workers who want to fight for fair treatment. We will not back down until we get these nurses what they deserve.”
According to the union, July negotiations brought progress, with the committee securing a memorandum of agreement to provide teamsters nurses with retroactive economic benefits including a March 2025 general wage increase, the base pay market review and tier adjustments for advanced practice providers, a $250 bonus, shift differential and shift premium increases and matching contributions to workers’ 403(b) retirement plan.
However, the union says their fight is far from over. The next collective bargaining dates are scheduled for Sept. 17 and 18. 
In a statement, Royal Oak-based Corewell Health, which was formerly known as Beaumont Health, said they are continuing to bargain in good faith and remain focused on reaching an agreement. 
“We declined the union’s proposal to treat their bargaining committee members differently than our other team members. Our policies require team members to use paid time-off when they choose to be away from work, and we don’t intend to deviate from our policy,” the statement reads. “We remain committed to working with their committee members to accommodate their schedules whenever possible, including allowing them the opportunity to switch their schedule when possible consistent with staffing and patient care needs, as many of the committee members have done.”

With its global headquarters in Louisville, GE Appliances said Wednesday the first phase of investments will begin at plants in Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. As part of the investment, the company plans to expand its air conditioning and water heating portfolio, increase product production and “further modernize” 11 manufacturing plants in the U.S.
The investment is the second-largest in GE Appliances’ history and U.S. appliance history, the company said. The largest was the establishment of Appliance Park in Louisville during the 1950s. 
GE Appliances announced a $490 million investment to manufacture combo washer/dryers and front-load washers in Louisville earlier this year as part of the first phase of investment. That is expected to create 800 new jobs. 
“We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people, and communities,” said Kevin Nolan, president and CEO of GE Appliances, in a press release. “No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.”
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear praised the investment Wednesday morning. He said the company “established Kentucky as America’s destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation” and the planned investment “shows this iconic company’s unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success.” 
“This new investment highlights Kentucky’s ability to support world-class companies with a talented, skilled workforce and the resources needed to not just succeed, but thrive,” Beshear said. “The continued investment and support from GE Appliances in the Louisville community and across the commonwealth are important factors in our efforts to build a better Kentucky for the future.”
The news comes on the heels of other domestic manufacturing plans announced in Kentucky in recent days. Ford Motor Company said Monday it will invest nearly $2 billion to convert a longtime auto manufacturing plant in Louisville to build electric vehicles from a new platform adaptable to multiple vehicle types, aiming to launch a mid-sized EV pickup truck by 2027. Apple said last week it would spend $2.5 billion to fund the expansion of glass manufacturing for iPhones with Corning, a Harrodsburg-based company.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Getty-Images-LOUISVILLE-KENTUCKY-AUGUST-08-A-view-inside-the-dishwasher-production-facility-at-GE-Appliances-on-August-08-2025-in-Louisville-Kentucky-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-13 11:58:38.043644

King Women’s Center in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, March 26, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Though Utah’s rate of homelessness remains below the national average, a new report shows the state’s homeless population is continuing to rise — and the start of 2025 marked a significant uptick.
“It’s a big jump,” Wayne Niederhauser, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox’s state homeless coordinator, told Utah News Dispatch ahead of the report’s release Wednesday. “We haven’t seen that kind of jump for years.” 
The annual 2025 Point-in-Time Count — which is a national tally of sheltered and unsheltered people on a single night in January — showed 4,584 Utahns were experiencing homelessness in January 2025, up by 715 people from last year, an 18% increase. 
Utah’s homelessness rate is now 13 per 10,000 people, up from 11 per 10,000. But even though Utah is one of the fastest-growing states in the nation and has faced skyrocketing housing prices over the past five years, its rate of homelessness is still well below the 2024 national rate, which was 23 per 10,000. 
Though Niederhauser said it’s concerning to see an 18% jump, he said there is a “silver lining.”
“The silver lining is that 95% of those extra individuals were in shelter and not unsheltered,” he said. 
Under Code Blue temps and increased camping enforcement, volunteers count Utah homeless 

In the past several years, Niederhauser said Utah has typically seen only a 4% or 5% rate increase, but about 80% of those people were unsheltered. This year, he said, “the good part about that data point is that most of those individuals were sheltered.”
Of the 715 additional people experiencing homelessness during the 2025 Point-in-Time Count, 677 (95%) were sheltered and 38 (5%) were unsheltered, which the Utah Office of Homeless Services described in the report’s key findings as a “dramatic shift” from 2024, when that year’s count rose by 131 people, but only 23 (18%) were sheltered while 108 (82%) were unsheltered. 
“This year’s dramatic increase in sheltered individuals compared to unsheltered is largely attributed to the expansion of winter shelter capacity, which allowed more individuals experiencing homelessness to access shelter,” the report says. 
This year’s Point-in-Time Count took place during Code Blue temperatures, which prompted expansion of shelter capacity. Volunteers also questioned whether increased anti-camping enforcement, along with the frigid temperatures, could have factored into seeing fewer people on the streets. 
The report also includes several other notable findings, including:

Rising child homelessness: The number of Utah children experiencing homelessness increased from 589 to 662, a 22% increase. Children now make up 14% of Utah’s total Point-in-Time Count, which is still below 2024 national data, when children accounted for 19% of people experiencing homelessness across the U.S.
More unhoused seniors: The number of Utahns over the age of 64 experiencing homelessness rose from 251 to 356, an increase of 42%. The increase, state officials wrote, “may reflect broader demographic shifts,” with Utah’s population of those 65 and older growing by nearly 58% from 2013 to 2023 and expected to double by 2060, according to the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. But at the same time, “more seniors are being priced out of housing, often living on fixed incomes that can’t keep pace with rising rents and property costs,” state officials wrote.
Veterans experiencing homelessness: The number of veterans experiencing homelessness grew by 36%, rising from 121 to 165. “While this represents a notable year-over-year increase, the 2025 total remains within the historical range, falling between the 2023 count of 181 and the 2022 count of 155.

A rise in first-time homelessness: Factoring in not just people tallied during the Point-in-Time Count, but also those who accessed homeless services according to the state’s database, a total of 10,261 people in Utah experienced homelessness in 2024 for the first time, an increase of 5% from 2023. The state’s homelessness data dashboard shows 5,122 people were categorized as “previously homeless,” only a slight uptick from 4,942 people in 2023. In total, the state’s database reported 15,383 people accessing services in 2024 statewide.
To Niederhauser, the report shows even though Utah homelessness is rising — following a national trend of Americans faced with higher housing costs, inflation, and wages that aren’t keeping pace with cost of living — the state’s homeless system is providing options that those additional people are using rather than living on the streets. 
“There’s an increase in homelessness, but we’re addressing it in an effective way,” he said. 
Once a Motel 6, Utah’s long-awaited family shelter is about to open

In the report’s executive summary, Niederhauser highlighted a list of investments the 2025 Utah Legislature made to improve Utah’s homeless system, including: 

$3.9 million in ongoing funding to launch and operate a second family shelter in the Salt Lake Valley. Renovated from a Motel 6, the Family Interim Non-Congregate Housing Facility, or FINCH for short, opened in April.

$5.5 million in one-time funding was allocated for the 2026 fiscal year to expand emergency shelter operations during cold weather. In the 2025 fiscal year, investment in winter response supported 901 additional winter shelter beds, including 256 Code Blue beds and 3,370 emergency shelter nights provided in a hotel setting.
$16.7 million in ongoing, annually adjusted funding was distributed to cities hosting homeless shelters to help mitigate their impacts. 

What’s working and where are more resources needed?
The report showed some progress toward the state homeless system’s goals of making homelessness “rare, brief and nonrecurring,” but also areas where the system is falling short.
For example, state data showed a slight decrease in the number of days people are staying in emergency shelters. In 2024, 75% of emergency shelter stays were 90 days or less, down from 80% in 2023 and below previous years. 
“While this trend indicates people are experiencing homelessness for longer periods of time, most only need short-term shelter support before restabilizing,” the report stays. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the average length of stay in emergency shelter increased by 10 days (17%) compared to 2023, “highlighting the growing difficulty individuals face in securing stable housing,” the report says. “This trend underscores the urgent need for faster housing placements and a broader range of exit options from shelter.”
The number of Utahns experiencing chronic homelessness also remains an issue. According to the 2025 Point-in-Time Count, 1,233 were experiencing chronic homelessness — a 36% rise from 906 in 2024. But that group represented 27% of the total Point-in-Time Count, similar to 28% in 2023. 
“This highlights the continued need for supportive services for individuals with disabilities and long histories of homelessness, while also confirming that chronic homelessness remains a minority of the overall homeless population in Utah,” the report says. 
The report also showed, however, that supportive housing has continued to be a “key driver of long-term stability” for people exiting homelessness. For example, state data shows:

93% of people in permanent supportive housing “either retained their housing or moved on to other permanent options.” 2024 marked the “fourth consecutive year this success rate has held steady.”
In 2024, the percentage of people returning to homelessness within two years of exiting to permanent supportive housing declined slightly from 25% to 24%.
“These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of permanent supportive housing with wrap-around services in keeping Utah’s most vulnerable residents stably housed,” the report said.

In recent years, while lawmakers have put more money toward homeless services than they have in the past, there are still plenty of requests for more money that have gone unfunded. In 2025, lawmakers approved some but not all of the funding requests Niederhauser and his office asked for, leaving funding gaps that local officials have had to find ways to fill.

As his office prepares for another budget proposal, Niederhauser said his message to lawmakers for the upcoming 2026 general session in January is to acknowledge Utah’s homeless population is increasing. He also noted that the data shows the length of time people are staying in shelters has increased, indicating there’s a “gap” that needs to be filled when it comes to providing options for people to cycle out of emergency shelters. 
“That’s the service that we really need to focus on,” he said, including additional beds at the Utah State Hospital or expanding capacity in other areas of the state’s mental health system, as well as increasing capacity for supportive housing. 
“That is a good message for all of us, and it’s a good takeaway for the Legislature — for us to really focus on that big gap that we have for some of those services,” Niederhauser said. “If those are available, then the nights (people) spend in shelter goes down.”
For the first time, Utah’s Point-in-Time Count this year also included survey questions asking unsheltered people what type of shelter they would use if available. Its findings said:

610 preferred private rooms
568 preferred “bring-your-own setups (cars, tents, RVs) with shared facilities”
511 said they would use small units with shared bathrooms
356 were open to congregate shelters
236 said none of the above. 

Niederhauser said that survey “confirms” what state and local leaders have been hearing for a long time – that providing a range of options for people will help keep more people off of the streets. He pointed to the 50-bed “microshelter” community that opened last fall as a model that’s been a success, with plans to add another 54 units in coming months. 
“That kind of model we’re very bullish on because the outcomes have been excellent,” Niederhauser said.
He also said those survey questions are expected to inform the design of a planned 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus, which is expected to offer both congregate and non-congregate shelter options.
Efforts to site 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus still underway
Lawmakers also passed legislation to allow the state to use eminent domain powers to “accelerate site acquisition” for a planned “transformative homeless services campus, with statutory authority limited to a defined area in Salt Lake City, northeast of the airport,” the report’s executive summary said. 
State can officially use eminent domain to site a new homeless campus. What now?

Niederhauser and other state officials have been working for months to site that homeless campus (expected to include 1,200 to 1,600 beds), but they have not yet announced what properties they’ve been eying. Last fall, the Utah Homeless Services Board set a deadline of Oct. 1, 2025 for the campus to be built, but Niederhauser said the siting process has been taking longer than expected.
“Our timeline is ASAP,” Niederhauser said when asked about a new timeline for selecting the property for the homeless campus. “We know this is needed. We are looking at several properties, all of which have some difficult situations to overcome, like wetlands. I’ll highlight wetlands, because wetlands isn’t something I can solve in two weeks, three months, or even six months because the Army Corps of Engineers has to be involved in that, and there’s a process you have to go through.”
Depending on the outcomes of those evaluations, Niederhauser said that will determine whether state officials move forward with eminent domain powers to site the campus. He said a new timeline is not yet clear, but “we’re not sitting on this.”
“We are working hard,” he said, adding that it’s been challenging to find a property along the Wasatch Front, which has limited property available that hasn’t already been developed. “Unfortunately, you know, the need is huge. We appreciate the acute need, the serious need of this. So we’re not letting grass grow under our feet. We’re working hard to find a pathway.”

Heather Meyer of Overland Park opposed a budget proviso requiring the elimination of pronouns from state employee email signature blocks. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas state and university employees were told they must remove pronouns from their email signatures and all other work communications as a result of a directive lawmakers inserted into the state budget.
The budget proviso, which threatens constitutional rights to free speech, requires state agencies to remove all diversity, equity and inclusion programming, training and positions. State employees must remove any “gender ideology” in email signatures and work communications.
“I don’t know what was going to be accomplished by this,” said Rep. Mike Amyx, D-Lawrence. “I couldn’t see a positive outcome on it. The potential for somebody to get in trouble because of this bill is real.”
Amyx, a ranking minority leader on the higher education budget committee, said the provision puts state universities and their faculty in uncomfortable situations.
“I don’t even have a direction that I can tell them right now,” Amyx said. “I’m just concerned.”
The University of Kansas announced last month that it would comply with a directive from the Kansas Board of Regents. KU employees had until July 31 to remove pronouns from their email signature blocks.
KU chancellor Doug Girod released a statement July 22 outlining the rules of the ordinance, ending the message stating the KU community is founded on “respect and support” for one another.
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression wrote in a July 28 letter to the Board of Regents that universities following the guidance infringe upon employees’ First Amendment rights. FIRE said the language in the guidance is overly broad and vague.
“We offered to work with the Board to craft alternative guidance that clarifies the scope of the law consistent with the First Amendment,” the letter said. “However, the President of the Board has told the media he is unlikely to change the guidance.”
The organization’s letter said it will continue to fight for the rights of employees affected by this new anti-free speech law.
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican who is seeking his party’s nomination for governor, said in a statement he is proud to have championed this legislation, following President Donald Trump’s lead on cutting DEI programming.
“ ’DEI’ programs promote divisive environments that pressure students and faculty to adopt specific viewpoints, undermining academics and setting Kansas universities back,” Masterson said.
Rep. Heather Meyer, D-Overland Park, said she voted against the budget because of its consequences for minority communities across the state. She said the budget proviso proves legislators’ lack of understanding of the LGBTQ+ and minority communities.
“It’s just deplorable,” Meyer said. “It’s codifying hatred. Universities have typically been beacons of free speech. To turn into this is awful. We just have to keep fighting.”
She said many state employees won’t be able to risk not complying with the budget requirement, especially without a clear understanding of the consequences.
“For people who are actively removing their pronouns and don’t feel safe in keeping them on there and protest, there’s absolutely no judgment about that,” Meyer said. “Everybody needs to support their family and feel safe speaking out.”
The Lawrence Trans Coalition publicly denounced KU’s decision to comply with the budget requirement.
The coalition called for “overwhelming pushback” and recommended wearing pronoun pins to work or calling attention to the budget requirement in email signatures.
“It is genuinely harrowing to see them so quickly comply with an anti-trans bill that has no explicit enforcement mechanisms spelled out within the text,” said Lawrence Trans Coalition politics and public relations chair Isaac Johnson. “The implication here is that the Kansas Legislature views the mere concept of disclosing pronouns as political extremism that must be oppressed.”
Some state employees have said the forced removal of pronouns inherently targets the trans community. The bill does not outline what else can and can’t be in an email signature, such as “Mr.” or “Mrs.”
“If a Kansas state employee wanted to end an email with ‘God bless,’ they would be allowed. If they wanted to mention their partner, a holiday they celebrate, their heritage, they would be allowed to do that,” Johnson said. “The sharing of pronouns is a practice meant to signal to others that they are safe to disclose their trans status with them. This ban actively robs state employees from promoting that.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2250190-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-13 11:58:38.043644

At the same time, New Haven Public Schools (NHPS) has begun to roll out the AI tools Gemini Pro and NotebookLM for administrators. The district won’t make these programs available for teachers until they’re trained in the new district policy, and it won’t make these programs available for students until a dedicated AI security and monitoring platform is in place.
The school board took that unanimous vote of support for the AI policy at its latest meeting, which was held Monday night at King/Robinson School and over Zoom. 
NHPS Asst. Supt. Keisha Redd-Hannans presented a draft version of the AI policy — which focuses on AI use for instruction and in classrooms — earlier in August. 
During a previous presentation, Redd-Hannans said the district policy comes as educators, administrators, and students are already making use of their own AI tools. She emphasized that the district’s use of the now-selected platforms Gemini Pro and NotebookLM should help with retaining teachers by providing additional instructional support, student toolkits, and operational efficiency. 
She also emphasized that while AI use continues to grow and be embraced across all walks of life, NHPS’ policy and implementation plans will enforce that AI will ​“support but not substitute” teachers and critical thinking in schools. 
Click here to read the full policy, which allows staff and students to use AI to review work, research, and brainstorm for classroom projects and discussion while always citing use of AI. The policy prohibits plagiarism or using AI tools as substitutes for completing assignments. 
In an email statement sent to the Independent on Tuesday, Redd-Hannans and city Chief Technology Officer Michael Simeone said that the city and school district worked together to select Gemini Pro and NotebookLM as the vetted AI platform for staff and students to use. 
The system will first be made accessible only to NHPS administrators.
“These advanced tools will enhance efficiency in curriculum planning, policy review, and day-to-day operations, while allowing staff to streamline processes and focus more on supporting teachers and students,” Redd-Hannans and Simeone said. ​“These tools are designed to help staff work smarter, communicate more clearly, and make data-informed decisions that benefit the entire school community.”They said that the district’s AI committee will meet to discuss a professional learning timeline for staff. That timeline will detail when these AI programs will be made available to staff. Once teachers are trained on the policy, they will be given access to the tools.​“The next major step will be selecting a dedicated AI security and monitoring platform,” Redd-Hannans and Simeone continued. ​“This system will be implemented before any AI tools are introduced to the student population. 
“Our number one priority is protecting our students and staff. We will not deploy AI directly to students until we have robust safeguards in place to prevent exposure to restricted content and protect against malicious actors.” 
Once a security and monitoring system is implemented, the AI tools will be introduced to the student population.
Redd-Hannans also told the Independent that the AI tools will be accessible through each person’s NHPS account. That means that, once they’re granted access, students and staff will be able to log into their NHPS accounts through an NHPS-provided Chromebook or a personal device to use the AI tools. 
The set-up process for administrative access is currently underway.
Before passing the policy through a unanimous vote Monday, Board of Education member Ed Joyner asked that the district create school-by-school structures to evaluate and monitor the tools’ ethical usage. Fellow school board member Abie Benitez responded that an AI committee has been established per the policy guidelines, which will help the district oversee what’s working and what’s not next year.

Vermont Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas said Wednesday her office will not be sharing personally identifiable information about voters in Vermont with President Donald Trump’s administration, if the federal government asks. 
The announcement, in a press release, comes as Trump’s Department of Justice has sought voter information from at least nine other states in recent months, according to Stateline. That could include voters’ dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and social security numbers, among other identifying data, according to the news outlet.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Budget bill threatens Mainers’ access to food, health care and other necessities, experts warn

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

Noorani will succeed Jim Canales, the foundation’s longtime president who announced in January that he planned to step down after 11 years in the role.
The post Ali Noorani tapped as new Barr Foundation president appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE BARR FOUNDATION has named Ali Noorani, a longtime nonprofit and philanthropic leader, as its new president. Noorani, who currently serves as program director of the US Democracy Program at the California-based William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, will succeed Jim Canales, the foundation’s longtime president who announced in January that he planned to step down after 11 years in the role.
Noorani, 52, who lives in Oakland with his wife and daughter, will take the reins on December 1. 
The Barr Foundation was founded in 1997 by Amos and Barbara Hostetter, using proceeds from the sale of Continental Cablevision, which Amos Hostetter co-founded in 1963 and which was sold in 1996. It’s now one of the largest foundations in New England, with more than $2.8 billion in assets. 
Noorani’s “life’s work has been defined by service, and his values are deeply aligned with the values Amos and I hope will always define Barr – including humility, curiosity, and the long-term view that investing in potential and empowering people in communities always requires,” Barbara Hostetter, chair of the foundation’s board of trustees and of the search committee for a new president, said in a statement.
“I am deeply humbled and grateful for the opportunity to lead the Barr Foundation at this moment and to build on its exceptional reputation,” Noorani said in a statement. 
It will mark a return to Massachusetts for Noorani, who served from 2003 to 2008 as executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.
After leaving Massachusetts, Noorani served as president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum in Washington, DC, where he tripled its staff while leading a national effort to engage moderate and conservative voices in conversation on immigration issues. 
“We’ve always thought about this as an issue that’s all about politics or is all about policy,” Noorani said on a 2017 episode of The Codcast. “What I have learned about the immigration debate is that I think the majority of Americans see this as a question about culture and about values.” 
Noorani said it’s possible to find common ground on immigration issues when they’re discussed on those terms. Conversations he had around that time with religious figures, law enforcement officials, and business leaders led to the formation of an alliance dubbed Bibles, Badges, and Business for Immigration Reform. “If you hold a Bible, you wear a badge, or you run a business, you want a common sense solution to the immigration system,” Noorani said on the 2017 podcast. 
He authored a 2017 book about his search for common ground on the issue, There Goes The Neighborhood: How Communities Overcome Prejudice and Meet the Immigration Challenge. He published a second book on the topic in 2022, Crossing Borders: The Reconciliation of a Nation of Immigrants. 
In the 2017 podcast interview – during the first year of Donald Trump’s first term – Noorani said that he’s an eternal optimist, but that Trump’s election clearly made the path to immigration reform tougher. That seems like a dramatic understatement today. 
Barr’s grantmaking is principally focused on three areas – arts, climate, and education. Barbara Hostetter said in a statement that Noorani’s “enthusiasm for Barr’s core issues of arts, climate, and education was palpable, as was his readiness to propel Barr into its next chapter.”
(MassINC, the nonprofit that publishes CommonWealth Beacon, is currently the recipient of two three-year grants totaling $1.25 million to support general operating costs as well as its policy work on Gateway Cities. CommonWealth Beacon previously received a Barr grant to support reporting on arts and culture.) 
“I am personally thrilled to return once again to Boston, a community I came to know and love early in my career,” Noorani said. “My wife, Toya, and I are excited to raise our young daughter as a Celtics fan.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
Self-driving cars aren’t here yet, but states are getting the rules ready

And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

(Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Getty Images)Indiana’s latest reading assessment scores showed the largest year-to-year improvement since the state began IREAD testing in 2013, rising nearly five percentage points from last year, according to new results released Wednesday.
The new data revealed that 87.3% of third graders — about 73,500 out of more than 84,000 students statewide — demonstrated proficient reading skills in 2024-25. That’s roughly 6,000 more proficient readers than a year ago and the highest rate since before the pandemic.
  Indiana Education Secretary Katie Jenner testifies in committee on Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The scores were presented by Indiana Department of Education officials at the August State Board of Education meeting in Indianapolis.
“This is a time for celebration, and it is also a time to double-down on our commitment to helping even more students learn to read,” said Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner in a press release. “The data is clear – what we are doing is working – so let’s keep at it, ensuring a brighter future for Hoosier students.”
Gov. Mike Braun called the results “another example of how we are leading the nation in education,” adding that “helping every Hoosier to live out their American dream starts with the ability to read.”
Jenner and other state officials emphasized that the record jump follows a multiyear effort to reverse pandemic-era declines, anchored by up to $170 million in state and Lilly Endowment Inc. funding to expand teacher training in the “science of reading,” boost early screening and target interventions for struggling readers.
By 2027, state officials want 95% of third graders to demonstrate reading proficiency.
This year, more than 10,000 students did not pass the IREAD but good cause exemptions are still being processed so it is not yet known how many students will be held back under a stricter new law.
Gains across all students groups
For the first time, scores on the Indiana Reading Evaluation and Determination assessment, or IREAD, improved for every student group measured, according to IDOE. 
Black students saw a 7.5 percentage point increase from last year, bringing their total gain since 2021 to 14.1 points. Students in special education also improved by 7.5 points year-over-year and are up 12.2 points from 2021. 
Among students receiving free or reduced-price meals, proficiency climbed 6.6 points from last year and 10 points over four years.
Hispanic students — whose proficiency dropped in 2024 — improved by 7.5 points in 2025. English learners, whose results had been largely flat for three years, posted a 7.2 point increase.
Earlier testing, more interventions
The pass rate includes students who took and passed the IREAD a year early, during second grade. Under a new policy in effect this year, all second graders took the assessment, giving them up to five opportunities to pass before fourth grade.
In years prior, schools could opt-in to second grade testing.
Roughly 81,800 second graders participated in IREAD testing this year, compared to just under 69,000 in 2024 and fewer than 46,000 in 2023.
During the most recent academic year, 68% of second graders either passed or were considered “on track” to pass by the end of third grade.
The state’s data showed that 96% of second graders who were “on track” last year passed in third grade this year, while more than 65% of those identified as “at risk” in 2024 met the standard in 2025.
The annual IREAD pass rate measures one year’s third grade class, counting both those who passed the test in third grade and those who passed it early, as second graders.
Students are given up to five total attempts at the assessment before fourth grade — two in second grade, and three more in third.
Retention numbers still to come
While the 2024-25 IREAD results show sharp gains, the number of students who will be held back under Indiana’s reading retention law won’t be known until after the state’s Oct. 1 school enrollment “count day.” 
That’s when IDOE will finalize which third graders failed to pass the exam and did not qualify for one of several “good cause exemptions” permitted by state law.
In 2023, 13,855 third graders did not pass IREAD, according to IDOE data. Of those, 7,528 received good cause exemptions; 6,327 did not. Even so, fewer than 500 students were retained and required to repeat third grade.
Indiana’s new third-grade reading retention law took effect for the 2024-2025 school year, meaning more students are expected to be held back.
Under the statute, a student who would otherwise be retained in third grade is allowed to advance to fourth grade if they meet one of the following criteria:

Previously retained in grade three for one school year;
Have an intellectual disability or an IEP indicating retention is inappropriate, with promotion approved by the student’s case conference committee;
Are an English learner with fewer than two years of English instruction, with promotion recommended by a parent-teacher-administrator committee based on research-based instructional practices;
Earned a proficient or above proficient score in grade three math on the statewide summative assessment; or
Have received at least two years of intensive reading intervention and were retained more than once in kindergarten through second grade.


Retention requirements were strengthened in 2024 as part of Indiana’s push to reach 95% third grade reading proficiency by 2027. 
Students who do not pass in third grade must receive additional reading instruction aligned with the science of reading and retest each spring and summer until they either pass or are promoted to seventh grade, even if they advance to the next grade under a good cause exemption.

Galvin understands the ideal often put forth that lawmaking is best done through the give and take of legislative deliberation. But he also knows the difference between thoughtful deliberation and bill-killing delay tactics.  
The post Galvin pursuing ballot question on same-day voter registration  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","NO ONE NEEDS to school Bill Galvin in the principles of representative governance and the legislative process.  
As secretary of state, Galvin is not only the Commonwealth’s chief election official; he also oversees the Massachusetts State Archives, a vast trove of documents detailing the state’s history in the birthing of American democracy. And before winning statewide office more than 30 years ago, Galvin served nine terms in the Massachusetts House, where he was known as a master of procedural arcana and political strategizing.  
All of which is to say that Galvin understands as well as anyone the ideal often put forth that lawmaking is best done through the give and take of legislative deliberation and debate. But he also knows better than most the difference between thoughtful deliberation and bill-killing delay tactics.  
That’s why, after years of inaction on Beacon Hill on legislation that would allow same-day voter registration, Galvin filed an initiative petition last week to put the issue on the 2026 statewide ballot so that voters can decide on the question directly.   
Despite countless hearings and discussion on the issue when same-day voter registration bills have been filed over the years, “it hasn’t happened,” Galvin said, summing up the result of those efforts to pass a bill. 
In the most recent attempt, in 2022, when the Legislature was assembling a package of election reforms, including making vote-by-mail permanent, the Senate, which has passed same-day bills several times, included it in its version of the bill, but the House did not. The issue didn’t make it into the final bill that the two chambers agreed on.  
A coalition of groups has been pushing legislation that would have Massachusetts join the 22 states plus Washington, DC, that allow same-day registration. Currently, someone must register to vote in Massachusetts at least 10 days before an election to cast a ballot. 
“Massachusetts has a great opportunity to strengthen our democracy by ensuring that every eligible citizen has a chance to cast a ballot on Election Day,” said Geoff Foster, executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, one of the groups leading the Election Modernization Coalition.  
Foster called Galvin’s ballot question filing “a step in the right direction,” and said he hopes it will “increase movement on Beacon Hill.” But he said the coalition’s main focus right now is on getting same-day registration passed through legislation.  
State Rep. Carmine Gentile, who is co-sponsoring the same-day registration bill with Sen. Cynthia Creem, also welcomed the added pressure from Galvin’s move to put the question on the ballot.   
“Between the ballot petition and this bill, hopefully this will be the session that it gets through,” he said. Not allowing same-day registration is “an unnecessary barrier to allowing people who should be able to vote to vote,” said Gentile, a Sudbury Democrat. He said studies show same-day registration increases turnout by anywhere from 3 to 11 percent.  
Galvin says he’s had discussion with some labor leaders who could help mount the signature-gathering drive needed to get the question on the ballot. 
Why the same-day bill has stalled repeatedly in the House isn’t clear. Some Beacon Hill watchers speculate that the motive is simple self-preservation – that incumbent lawmakers are concerned it could disrupt established voting patterns that have served them well, with a challenger drawing new voters to the polls on Election Day.  
“It puts a little more uncertainty into things,” Gentile said. “I’m sure that is a consideration of some legislators. Hopefully we’ll get beyond that.”  
For his part, Galvin would only say, “There’s obviously opposition from people who are in a position to be influential.”  
The bill filed by Gentile and Creem was referred to the Joint Committee on Election Laws, where a hearing on it has not yet been scheduled. Rep. Daniel Hunt, the House co-chair of the committee, did not return a message on Tuesday. 
Galvin has in the past said he supports same-day registration but raised concerns about  logistical issues in implementing it that he now says have been addressed. While there was concern in the past over the ability of local election officials to manage same-day registration, Galvin said adopting the reform would actually relieve local officials of a huge administrative burden.  
Currently, if someone appears at a polling place where they claim to be registered, but where there is no record to support that, they are allowed to cast a “provisional” ballot. Before counting the ballot, local officials must pore over records in the ensuing days to determine whether there was an error and the person had been duly registered.  
“We had clerks who were literally tied up for days,” Galvin said of the task of going over provisional ballots after an election. As evidence that same-day registration would make election operations smoother, Galvin pointed to the fact that the town clerk in Framingham provided one of the 10 signatures from registered voters he was required to submit with the filing of an initiative petition.  
Gentile said Galvin’s support should allay any concerns that same-day registration could jeopardize the integrity of the election process. “He’s the gold standard for election experts nationwide,” Gentile said of Galvin, who is the longest-serving chief state election official in the country.  
Foster, the Common Cause leader, said Massachusetts has made lots of progress in promoting voter participation. Along with the 2022 bill that made permanent the pandemic-driven adoption of voting by mail, in 2018, the state passed automatic voter registration, which registers eligible residents when they interact with the Registry of Motor of Vehicles or certain state health agencies. Of the push for same-day registration, Foster said, “This is the one reform that remains unfinished.”

Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.
Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

Mariners using the Bering Strait are largely abiding by guidelines and rules established in 2018 to protect sensitive areas from disturbances, according to a newly published study by researchers from the University of Alaska Anchorage and Michigan State University.
There, recommended shipping lands and designated “areas to be avoided,” around ecologically sensitive sites, were established by the International Maritime Organization in response to a joint U.S.-Russia initiative. The IMO is an agency of the United Nations responsible for improving the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution from ships.
The study analyzed transit records from 2015 to 2022 that were collected by the Marine Exchange of Alaska, a nonprofit marine organization. It found good adherence to the recommended shipping lanes and a decided shift away from use of territory in the designated areas to be avoided.
The attention to the new IMO-approved standards, which include some mandatory rules for certain large vessels but are mostly advisory guidelines, is a piece of good news during strained times, the study’s lead author said.
“It is really encouraging to see that having these voluntary things do affect how vessels are operating in the region,” said Izabella R. Block of UAA’s Institute of Social and Economic Research.
Marine shipments through the Bering Strait have increased dramatically since 2010, rising from 242 in total that year to 665 in 2024, according to the Marine Exchange of Alaska. The Juneau-based organization tracks vessel traffic and provides information to enhance safety.

(Image provided by NASA/his image was acquired on June 2, 2017, by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the NASA-NOAA Suomi NPP satellite)
 

	While traffic has increased overall, the mix of vessels is different on either side of the maritime border. In 2024, for example, tankers accounted for the largest slice of Russian Bering Strait vessel traffic; the strait is an important passageway for ships carrying Russian liquefied natural gas to Asian markets. On the Alaska side, tugs and towing vessels accounted for the biggest slide of 2024 Bering Strait transits in 2024. The Russian side had a higher proportion of cargo- and fishing-related transits through the strait in 2024; the Alaska side had a higher proportion of passenger vessels traveling there last year, according to the Marine Exchange of Alaska’s data.
Many of those types of vessels were already using the recommended traffic lanes prior to 2018, Block said. Because of that, shifts to those lanes might be subtle. The shifts away from the designated areas to be avoided are more noticeable, particularly for cargo ships, tankers and tugs, she said.
The study also found that vessels that use the strait frequently are more likely to stick to the rules and guidelines.
“It was really interesting to see that those that transit the region more often tended to have higher rates of abiding by the policy than those that transit it, like, once out of the eight years,” Block said. That points to a possible need for more mariner education, she said.
Exchanges and cooperation, which flourished in the immediate post-Soviet era, nosedived after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. and other nations imposed sanctions on Russia and excluded that nation from past levels of participation in international forums like the eight-nation Arctic Council. And even before 2022, relations between the U.S. and Russia had soured, in part because of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region.
But some amount of international cooperation is needed in the Bering Strait because there is so much at stake, Arctic experts say.
The strait, a little more than 50 miles wide at its narrowest point – and with only 2.4 miles separating Russiamar’s Big Diomede Island from Alaska’s Little Diomede Island – is the narrow Pacific gateway to the Arctic.
Indigenous communities on both sides of the strait have deep roots and cultures that depend on healthy natural resources.

	With whales, walruses and other animals using it to pass between the Bering Sea below the Arctic Circle and the Chukchi Sea above it, the strait is a “marine mammal superhighway,” in the words of Margaret Williams, a senior fellow at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government’s Arctic Initiative and a veteran of Alaska-Russia conservation efforts. It is also one of the key global flyways for migratory birds that spend their breeding seasons in the full-daylight summer days of the Arctic, she pointed out.
At the same time, it has become a place of new international tension.
Russia has been expanding its Arctic military presence over recent years, including in the Bering Strait region, with expanded facilities and more exercises.
China also poses some potential security concerns in the region. It has engaged in joint operations with Russia, and the U.S. Coast Guard said last week that it is monitoring two Chinese research vessels that crossed through the Bering Strait into the Chukchi Sea off northwestern Alaska.
The U.S. may also be increasing its military presence as well in the Bering Sea and, by extension, the Bering Strait. U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and others are recommending the reopening of a shuttered U.S. Navy station on Adak Island in the Aleutian chain.
Mike Sfraga, former chair of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission and the former U.S. Arctic ambassador at large, said the adversarial atmosphere presents new dangers. Lack of communication across borders – or miscommunication – could lead to unintended disasters, Sfraga said.
“I worry about things like an oil spill in the Bering Strait, because that would devastate communities and regions,” he said at the recently convened Arctic Encounter Summit in Anchorage. He was among several experts who attended the conference held at the end of July.
John Holdren, who served as the senior White House science adviser in former President Barack Obama’s administration, said the end to most scientific cooperation and exchange has been bad for science around the Arctic, where the impacts of climate change are amplified.

	“It’s been very slow, very difficult, and extremely damaging to progress on issues about pan-Arctic change, in a circumstance where Russia has the largest territory, the largest territorial water, the most permafrost, the most people in the Arctic,” Holdren said during a breakout session at the Arctic Encounter event.
Still, there are “some reasons for hope” for continued cooperation, said Holdren, who is now a research professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, where he holds a leadership role at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Holdren pointed out that even in the Cold War era, the U.S. and Soviet Union found common ground in the Bering Strait region and managed to cooperate on specific issues of safety and conservation. As long as war in Ukraine continues, such cooperation will be limited – but still possible, at least on the lower regional level rather than on the high-profile national level, he said.
Block said that type of cooperation and communication seems to be underway among Bering Strait mariners.
“There is cooperation. I think it’s just kind of a quiet cooperation,” she said.
A next step, Block said, could be the expansion of protections in the strait. The 2018 rules and guidelines did not include a designated area to be avoided around the two Diomede Islands, she noted. While the designated shipping lanes provide some protection for the islands, some experts have argued that establishing a formal buffer would be a logical next step toward Bering Strait maritime safety.
Block said she “fully” supports that idea, based on input she has heard from people who live on Little Diomede.
“They get so much traffic that just goes right by, and they get traffic that basically just zigzags in front of the island, like kind of killing time, to their next port,” she said. Local people say the ship traffic has changed the character of the beach, Block said, making it more pebbly than sandy.

Some experts want to establish a new designation “area to be avoided” around Alaska’s Little Diomede Island and Russia’s Big Diomede Island, which are separated by just 2.4 miles of water.

If the confusion and delays caused by self-checkout machines irritate you, California’s Legislature is considering a bill that aims to bring you some relief during your next shopping trip. But businesses say the proposal could drive up prices.
As CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller explains, the measure would require stores to designate at least one employee to help self-service customers and monitor the stands. Stores must also impose restrictions on the type and number of items a customer could bring through self-checkout, and they would need to have at least one traditional staffed checkout lane.
Proponents of the union-backed proposal say it would make self-checkout stations more efficient. Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, the bill’s author and chairperson of the Senate labor committee, also argues that it would make stores safer for workers, since understaffed stores are likelier targets for shoplifters. 

Smallwood-Cuevas, a Los Angeles Democrat, at a June Senate floor session: “This is about supporting our workforce, to make sure that they’re safe, but mostly to also make sure that they’re providing the level of service that customers expect and deserve.”

But with Californians struggling with the state’s high cost of living, business groups and grocers say that the bill would add labor costs that retailers will pass along to consumers by raising prices. 
They also have concerns over one of the measure’s provisions, which they say could lead to local municipalities passing their own stricter requirements, such as the one Long Beach recently enacted that requires stores to assign at least one worker for every three self-checkout machines.

State telework policies audited

From CalMatters politics reporter Maya:
Gov. Gavin Newsom appears to have ordered workers back to the office based on vibes rather than data on worker productivity, according to a newly released report from the California state auditor’s office.
The audit, which legislators ordered in May 2024 after Newsom first ordered workers back to the office two days per week, found that Newsom’s office not only failed to gather “important information” about departments’ office space needs and the associated costs, but also did not use any California state worker-specific productivity data to justify its in-office mandate. Earlier this year, Newsom signed a new executive order that upped the required in-office days from two to four. 
The governor’s office also ignored findings from its own telework oversight agency, the Department of General Services, which had collected estimates from departments on how much office space they would need to fulfill the mandate. 
Supporters of work-from-home cheered the report as further vindication for their claims that Newsom’s return-to-office mandates were capricious, politically motivated decisions rather than a true effort to increase worker productivity. Union leaders say adoption of flexible hybrid work policies can simultaneously save the state money and aid emissions goals by reducing commuter traffic. 



Will affordable housing production increase in CA?

With spending cuts to social services and tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich, President Donald Trump’s budget bill doesn’t offer much to like for California Democrats. But tucked inside the spending plan is a provision that housing advocates have been pushing for years and could help the state develop more affordable housing, write CalMatters’ Ben Christopher and Marisa Kendall.
Included in Trump’s budget is an increase in support for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which is the most important federal funding source for affordable housing. California uses this tax credit for low-income projects, and experts say this could help the state double the number of affordable units over the next decade.
Though it’s unclear how much the state’s housing situation will change due to the additional support — factors including tariffs, labor costs and state funding still need to be considered — a state committee that oversees the credits has already approved changes that incentivize developers to make the most of the new policy.

And lastly: Upending CA insurance regulation?

If passed, a proposed ballot initiative to change the way California regulates property insurance would prevent the public from intervening in rate filings and change the role of insurance commissioner from an elected office to a gubernatorial appointment. Find out who is proposing this measure from CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: As the California Legislature became dominated by one party and the state Capitol press corps shrank, governmental secrecy has become more entrenched.
California’s independent commission is considered the gold standard for redistricting, and Newsom’s plan to redraw the maps to benefit Democrats disrespects the will of voters, writes Jeanne Raya, a San Gabriel resident who served on California’s first Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission.

The Center for Business and Economic Research at UNLV surveyed more than 300 Nevadans who self-identified as unemployed and seeking a job. The results, released this week, suggest there are disconnects between the jobs people desire, the ones they are qualified for, and what’s actually available.
The center, which worked on the Nevada Job Seeker Survey with the Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation, believes the insights could be useful as the state “continues to navigate post-pandemic economy recovery and braces for more economic uncertainty ahead.”
The survey indicated that over half of job seekers want to work in a different industry than the last job they held, but that they aren’t eyeing the most rapidly growing fields. Transportation, hospitality, and administration were the desired industries. The survey did not document what industries workers had left.
Researchers wrote job seekers’ desires is something the state should consider, because, while those industries are currently dominant, they aren’t growing as fast as other areas.
The state’s fastest-growing sector, health care, was desired by only 15.5% of survey respondents, ranking 7th among the options available. The top three desired industries are expected to grow at roughly half the rate of health care over the next decade.
The CBER survey didn’t break out occupations by subsectors, but the health care sector includes home health and personal care aides, the occupation that has grown the most nationally for at least a decade, is projected to grow more than any other occupation through 2033, and paid a median annual wage of less than $35,000 in 2024.
‘Structural unemployemnt problem’
When asked in the survey what the biggest challenge to transitioning to a new job would be, the “lack of available job opportunities” was the most selected response statewide. Regionally, job availability as a perceived barrier was most pronounced among unemployed people in Clark County
Educationally, lack of job opportunities was cited by nearly 40% of those surveyed who have bachelor’s degrees, compared to roughly 27% of respondents with either associate’s or high school degrees.
Citing research indicating just over half of Nevada jobs require skills beyond high school but short of a bachelor’s degree, the state has  “an oversupply of workers with high school diplomas and bachelor’s degrees relative to demand.”
Southern Nevada has seen strong regional employment growth, the report notes, “suggesting a mismatch between available jobs and job seekers’ skills or interests.”
Transportation was the second most selected answer statewide, but the topmost answer selected by rural Nevadans. It was also the biggest perceived barrier for respondents aged 24 and younger.
Inadequate skills training and certifications was the third most selected response statewide, but the top answer in Washoe County. (For comparison, Clark County respondents listed inadequate skills as the fourth biggest obstacle.)
Forbes last year ranked Reno as having one of the highest percentages of residents aged 25 and up with a bachelor’s degree. Referencing that ranking, the CBER report concluded “the current labor market may not align with the qualifications of job seekers. That is, a structural unemployment problem exists.”
“The influx of tech and manufacturing companies in Reno has created more higher skills job opportunities, but might be limiting opportunities for individuals without advanced credentials or specialized training in the tech industry,” the report said.
Reasons for unemployment
The survey found the top reasons for job separation included involuntary layoffs, family obligations, and health issues.
Being laid off was the most-cited reason for all respondents, but were more commonly cited by those with lower levels of education and Hispanic Nevadans.
Among the short-term unemployed — that is, people who’ve been unemployed for fewer than six months — family obligations were the leading reason cited for leaving their last job: 23.8%.
CBER noted that, while family obligations can include elder care or other types of care, its prevalence as a reason cited for unemployment was most pronounced for people with children. It was the top reason cited by parents with one child, and a close second (behind involuntary layoff) for those with two to four children. Those findings align with similar surveys conducted nationally, according to researchers.
Previous surveys have found that employers are aware that childcare issues are a barrier to employer retention and recruitment.
CBER found that women’s employment is disproportionately impacted by family obligations: 22.5% of women cited them as the reason for leaving their last job, compared to 14.8% of men.
Behind layoffs and family obligations were health-related factors: 16.7% of respondents cited it as the leading cause. CBER noted that no demographics stood out as being more impacted, “indicating that personal health concerns can affect individuals broadly.”
The results on separations differed from the year prior. In 2023, involuntary layoff was also ranked first, but made up a smaller share — 21.4% in 2024 compared to 15% in 2023. Family obligations was the third most common reason cited in 2023, behind “work environment,” which dropped to the fifth most common reason.

This story was originally reported The 19th.
“In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” a pastor tells CNN. “And I would ordinarily be the one that would cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.”
Another agrees, saying he’d back an end to a woman’s right to vote: “I would support that, and I’d support it on the basis that the atomization that comes with our current system is not good for humans.”
The discussion of 19th Amendment rights was part of a news segment focused on Doug Wilson — a self-proclaimed Christian nationalist pastor based in Idaho — that was reposted to X by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The secretary is among Wilson’s supporters, and his involvement with Wilson’s denomination highlights how a fringe conservative evangelical Christian belief system that questions women’s right to vote is gaining more traction in the Republican Party.
Kristin Du Mez, a professor of history at Calvin University and author of “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,” said Wilson’s broader vision of Christian nationalism has gotten more attention over the past several years, alongside President Donald Trump’s rise to power.
“He was a fairly fringe figure, but this moment was really his moment,” she said. “And then as part of that, also, I think he signaled and gave permission to others that they didn’t need to hide some of their more controversial views, such as, should women have the vote? And that’s something that you didn’t hear proudly promoted from very many spaces, even just a handful of years ago.”
In the CNN interview, Wilson said he’d like to see the United States become a Christian and patriarchal country. He advocates for a society where sodomy is criminalized and women submit to their husbands and shouldn’t serve in combat roles in the military — a belief Hegseth has also publicly shared in the past though walked back during his confirmation hearings.
Hegseth appeared to support the nearly seven-minute interview with the caption, “All of Christ for All of Life.” Wilson has built an evangelical empire over the past 50 years that is centered in Moscow, Idaho, and now spans more than 150 congregations across four continents — including a new church in Washington, D.C. In July, Hegseth and his family attended the inaugural service at Christ Church, according to CNN.
“The Secretary is a proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson,” Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement to The 19th. “The Secretary very much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson’s writings and teachings.”
Du Mez said Wilson built his brand as a vocal critic of mainstream evangelicalism.
“They were too wishy washy,” Du Mez said, referring to Wilson’s view of much of White evangelicalism in the 1990s and early 2000s. “They were too soft. And so he was kind of bringing a harsher biblical truth, and that included things like a much more rigid application of biblical patriarchy. ”
In 2024, only 1 in 10 Americans qualified as Christian nationalism adherents, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.
Ryan Dawkins, an assistant professor of political science at Carleton College, said Christian nationalism hasn’t necessarily gotten more popular in the past 20 years. But there have been partisan trends.
“While they used to be more evenly divided between the two parties, over the last two decades, Christian nationalists have sorted into the Republican Party at incredibly high rates,” Dawkins said. “Christian nationalism is almost non-existent within the Democratic Party today, at least among White Democrats.”
While it’s still far from a mainstream opinion, several figures within the Republican Party have flirted with the idea of repealing the 19th Amendment.
Paul Ingrassia, who Trump nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, suggested approval for the idea in a 2023 podcast. Podcast host Alan Jacoby told Ingrassia that his own wife is the “biggest misogynist this side of the Mississippi, by the way. My wife literally thinks women should not vote.”
Ingrassia responded, “She’s very based,” a term expressing support for a bold opinion.
During the 2020 Republican National Convention, Republicans featured anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson, who has advocated for a new kind of voting system where households, not individuals, would cast votes. Head-of-household voting has historically disenfranchised women and people of color by concentrating power on the male leaders of the home.
In the leadup to the 2016 presidential election, FiveThirtyEight, a political forecasting site, shared data that suggested if women didn’t vote, Trump would win. The hashtag #repealthe19th — a reference to the 19th Amendment, which grants women the right to vote — quickly went viral.
And a former Trump-backed Michigan candidate for the U.S. House who has also held positions in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development was found to have made statements criticizing women’s suffrage while in college at Stanford University in the early 2000s. John Gibbs, now an assistant secretary at the agency, said that the country had been damaged by the 19th Amendment because women’s suffrage had led to an increase in the size and scope of the government. He added that women making up half of the population wasn’t enough reason for women’s suffrage. Gibbs’ 2022 congressional campaign denied he opposed women’s right to vote.
Kelly Marino, associate teaching professor at Sacred Heart University and author of “Votes for College Women: Alumni, Students and the Woman Suffrage Campaign” said that while conservative religious sects adamantly opposed to women’s suffrage have always existed, now there is renewed momentum.
“If you look at the way things played out in the past, we have this very liberal period followed by a conservative backlash,” Marino said. “And that’s what’s going on now. You have this period of liberalism where people were having a more expansive view of gender ideology, ideas about sexuality and women in politics. We had some pretty prominent female politicians that were making it pretty far in the last couple of years. And now there’s a backlash.”
Marino said the conservative backlash is reminiscent of the 1960s and 70s. There were significant progressive movements for civil rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights and environmental protections. But at the same time, the early 1970s saw the emergence of the men’s liberation movement, which focused primarily on issues like divorce law and child custody.
“There’s some men who are promoting a sort of return to tradition, a patriarchal vision for society,” Marino said. “It’s always sort of there, but it’s gaining traction within mainstream consciousness again. And now, you have all this stuff about soft girls and tradwives — this gender ideal of women being the domestic homemaker within a traditional family structure. There’s been a big push for this radical Christianity and some of its values — it’s become really popular even among younger people.”
Joseph Slaughter, an assistant professor of history at Wesleyan University, said Wilson is having his moment in the spotlight — but it’s important to remember that he does not speak for the majority.
“He delights in upsetting people or saying transgressive, un-PC things,” Slaughter said. “Ten years ago, when he posted a video talking about man’s biblical duties — people just sort of yawned and dismissed him. Now, he’s saying things and they’re gaining more currency because of some of this other new right-wing masculinity and the online manosphere.”
Slaughter said it’s particularly concerning that Wilson’s teachings have found their support in a man as powerful as Hegseth.
“What does it mean for somebody who’s running an organization which has had its struggles over the years integrating women and trying to understand existential questions about women’s role in combat?” Slaughter said. “Are Hegseth’s views reinforced by his religion now? Does this church reinforce his cultural chauvinism? For somebody in his position, it’s certainly fair game to ask.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/petehegseth_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706

The cars not backfiring. The sirens not wailing. The fireworks not erupting in sonic booms that bounce off hills and peal across valleys. 
This is the consequence of the largest planned deportation in American history. The Trump administration’s goal is to make life as unnavigable, unstable and uncomfortable as possible for people in the country illegally. The administration’s hope is they leave on their own, or with their kids in tow. 
“Self-deportation is a dignified way to leave the U.S.,” the Department of Homeland Security said in May as part of a pitch encouraging people to leave the country on their own. 
What remains are places that used to be: a shuttered restaurant, empty benches on weekends at MacArthur Park and even an abandoned taco stand, meat still on the grill hours later. The silence is the point.
Beneath that silence, behind locked doors, is a population in hiding. They were dishwashers and garment factory stitchers. They sold fruit on the street. This is the echo of the city they left behind.

Los Angeles has always been the author of its own story, from Chandler’s Marlowe to Angelyne’s bright pink Corvette. Now immigration enforcement agents wearing masks, driving cars with license plates from other states, are rewriting the narrative.
LA’s long, nervous summer entered its third month in August, but the immigration worksite raids in June and the smaller number of street-level stops in the following weeks have not brought the city to a standstill. 
But it is a city diminished.
The absences are seen and felt in areas where Latinos are the majority or plurality, and where people are less likely to be insulated by their own wealth.  
That means car traffic is nearly unchanged from a year ago, going by the frequency of crashes, but bus ridership was down 1.5 million rides in June, compared to the same month in 2024.  
UCLA and USC, are continuing to operate on schedule, but Cal State Los Angeles, which caters to a far higher proportion of low-income students, has given its students and faculty the option to take classes online. The school’s provost blamed “heavily armed immigration agents” that left students and faculty in fear.  
Another empty space: The spot on immigration court documents where the names of Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorneys should be. Judges have permitted them to operate anonymously, according to a report from The Intercept.  Asylum seekers and their attorneys must use their full names.
There’s also the missing space on Sergio Espejo’s left hand. The top half of his index finger was destroyed by what he describes as a grenade, fired by the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department during an anti-ICE protest.
In some of the quiet spaces, a small but coordinated resistance sprung up. Most of what they do is photograph immigration agents as they detain people. Sometimes, volunteers with immigration advocacy groups try to stop the detentions, and sometimes they are detained themselves. 
The administration’s goal was for deportation squads to arrest 3,000 people each day — a number that administration attorneys would not admit to in court. In California, according to the state Justice Department, about 3,000 people are in ICE custody as of July.
One of them is Mario Romero, the father of Yurien Contreras, a 20-year-old whose whole neighborhood is waiting for what comes next.
A family retreats
It’ll really pile up on you, if you let it. 
Contreras’ father was detained in the opening stanza of immigration enforcement action, a June 6 raid on a garment warehouse in the Fashion District.
He was the only one in the family with a full-time job. Contreras has confined herself to the house she shares with six people since the day he was taken — she rarely ventures beyond the gate bounding their South Central duplex.

When her two infant daughters are napping, when her brothers are out of the house, Contreras confronts the quiet in her home and in her neighborhood. Strangers are given a wary eye now – something Contreras said wasn’t true before the raids. Contreras said most of the people on her block fear a knock on the door from immigration agents. 
Contreras was born in this country, but her mother was not. One of her brothers, age 4, has developmental delays and appears to be regressing into old behaviors without his father home, pointing and shouting at objects on a kitchen counter but not making clear what he wants.
When Contreras looked for work after her father’s detention, she saw openings for warehouse workers but was afraid to leave the house — afraid for her own safety and afraid of what might happen if her mother had to venture off the property while she was gone. 
“There’s like, no like happy things,” she said. “And when there’s happy things like a birthday that just passed, we get even more sad because my dad’s not here.”
Family friends have kept them afloat by buying them diapers and groceries. In mid-July, Contreras made her first trip to the grocery store since the June 6 raid. 
It had to be done with precision. Her undocumented family members waited at home. She brought her cousin with her – if something happens to her, she wants her family to know when and where she was detained. Her legal status gives her no real comfort — she’s read the stories about ICE detaining U.S. citizens. 
The grocery store was out of tomatillos, something she’s never seen before. 
“You could tell something was going on,” Contreras said. “Back then (before the first immigration raid), everybody was going out, families were together, kids were laughing. Now the markets are empty.” 
She hustled inside the store, armed with a short list. She knew the shelves well enough to get where she needed to quickly. She left as soon as she could. She didn’t really take a deep breath until she was back home, behind the gate.
Contreras wanted to go to school for a certificate as a certified nurse assistant or ultrasound technician this fall, plans that are now on hold. The family also wanted to send one of her other brothers, 16, to a four-year college when he graduates high school, but now wonders whether that’s realistic.

And her anxiety attacks are back. 
“I had already gone from, like, a year and a half without having … anxiety attacks, no panic attacks,” she said, “but when they took away my dad, it triggered it. So my anxiety attacks have been coming back.” 
They kick in every week or two, and at the most inconvenient times, like when she’s already crying or when she’s arguing with her brothers. It feels like her heart is trying to jump out of her throat. Her breathing races. Sometimes she forgets her compensation strategy, which is taking deep breaths, and her friends have to remind her. Her father was good at calming her down. 
“So I don’t really show it to, you know, to my mom either, because I want to be strong for her, for the kids,” she said. “So, it’s like, I can’t talk to anybody. I feel like I can’t talk even though I know I can talk to people about it, it feels like I can’t.” 
She pauses. 
“I’d rather sometimes not talk about it. So when I keep it to myself, it’s, you know, it’s even worse.”
It’ll really pile up on you, if you let it. 
Searching for ICE in LA
Depending on your point of view, MacArthur Park is either a symbol of Los Angeles’ ascent to a truly global city or a symbol of its fall. Labeled as part of the city’s “Mayan Corridor” that welcomed immigrants from Mexico and Central America, its nickname is “the Ellis Island of the West.” 
It’s also a place of intense poverty and the violence and crime that accompanies it, conditions that led the owner of longtime city institution Langer’s Deli to threaten to abandon the area.

One morning this summer, immigration agents arrived at the park in green Humvees and on horseback, a massive show of force to a mostly empty park – word of the immigration agents’ impending arrival got around in the preceding days. Very few people stuck around to watch the show. 
Now, the 35-acre park is smaller somehow. There are fewer people manning its grills or playing music — though the church services held in front of little clusters of folding chairs still draw a crowd. 
Watching from the fringes was a man named Francisco Romero, dressed in an olive green T-shirt, blue jeans, gray running shoes and, on his neck, a red bandana. He wore a large straw hat, visible “so people know where to run to” in case of a raid or street stop.
On a weekend morning in July, Romero’s phone rang. He listened for a few seconds. 
“Put spotters on the 710 and the 110,” he said.
Romero oversees a complicated operation for the volunteer group Union del Barrio, people who have organized and trained since the first Trump administration to resist immigration enforcement by tracking agents’ vehicles and interrupting their arrests, which the volunteers call kidnappings. 
The freeways of Los Angeles are the only practical way for convoys of immigration vehicles to get from their home bases on Terminal Island or the city of Los Alamitos to their next raid, so volunteers with Union del Barrio wait and watch on freeway overpasses, two teams per overpass, observing both directions of traffic. 
At MacArthur Park, Romero was looking for signs that immigration enforcement agents were already on the scene, lying in wait. The first check was all the cars parked along the park’s border looking for what he calls “grab cars,” “drop cars” or “kidnapper ghost rides.” 
“These kidnapper ghost rides, we know which ones they are, and we’re always ID’ing new ones,” Romero said. “You run their plates and there’s no records found, their VIN numbers don’t match. That’s how you know.”
“Drop cars” are the unmarked vehicles parked in an area where immigration enforcement will later show up in large numbers, meant to serve as an advance force blending in with the rest of the cars on the block until they spring their trap and an agent or agents come spilling out, pulling people into the car for transport to a federal holding area.  
“Mire esta placa,” he said, telling an observer to check out the license plate of a red sedan parked behind a black Sprinter van. The van had paper plates. The red sedan had an Idaho license plate. The combination of paper plates and an out-of-state vehicle was what he was looking for. 
Romero pulled out his phone and took a picture of both vehicles. From inside the sedan, a man called out, asking why Romero was taking pictures. 
“We’re just trying to be careful, with ICE out here,” Romero said. 
“I’m not ICE,” said the man inside.
Romero made his apologies and waved. 
Once out of the man’s earshot, he said “that was totally an ICE agent.”
The goal, Romero said, was to be vigilant, not paranoid. He acknowledged the balance is delicate. 
Romero said immigration enforcement agents have tried to detain him at least twice after he and other Union del Barrio volunteers raced to the scene of an ICE raid in a store parking lot. Escape is constantly on his mind. 
His day job is evaluating nonprofits for grant-worthiness.  But under the nom de guerre of Chavo, he delivers orders over the phone, sending people who have chosen names like Froggy, War Machine or Porridge to scope out Home Depots or track a potential drop car. 
“This is a war strategy, so we’re using the language of war,” Romero said. “We’ve been preparing for this.” 
Romero moved on to a nearby Home Depot. 
In the store’s parking lot, a woman named Yesenia was selling Gatorades and mini-donuts. She declined to give her last name but said she is undocumented.

“We’re here because we have to make money,” she said in Spanish when asked about the risk of appearing in public. 
She pointed to a young man seated next to her. “Our kids.” 
A group of day laborers stood nearby, one of them shyly agreeing to speak to a reporter. They were scared, the man said, but they had no choice but to show up to the same places they went before the raids in Los Angeles began. That’s where the work is. 
“There is no option,” he said in Spanish, declining to give his real name. “It makes you have fear but there is no option.”

Where life feels unchanged

Down a darkened hallway, up three floors in an elevator, insulated by the street, Élephante opens into a modest dining room fronted by a large wooden desk from which three restaurant employees ask guests to kindly step out of the way of the elevator. 
It is just before noon on a Sunday in August. About 40 people fill out three-fourths of the room. The walls, eggshell white, do a good job keeping them hushed to a low murmur. 
This, according to the Los Angeles Times, is a minor evolution in Los Angeles dining. Or at least it was in 2019. Celebrities, sure, but also thoughtful curation of a menu that could have relied instead on the restaurant’s prime beachside location. 
The decor, the owner told the newspaper, was inspired by a trip to the Pantelleria, an island off the Italian coast most famous as the place where Romans banished their unwanted royalty. Longtime Times critic Bill Addison called it “a place to observe plenty of examples of humanity at peak physical perfection” and “the full Los Angeles stereotype.” 
Which Los Angeles goes unmentioned, but this Los Angeles is far from the raids. The closest one was 11 miles away, in Hawthorne, two months ago.

Labor unions are trying once again to regulate self-checkout lanes at California stores. This year’s bill waters down a version that died last session, but businesses still warn it will increase costs and lead to consumer frustration.


It’s been a long day at work, and you still need to stop by the store on your way home. 
To spare yourself more social interaction, you make a beeline for the self-checkout station, praying for a quick and painless transaction.
“Please wait, help is on the way,” the machine’s feminine voice coos, taunting you as you try desperately to flag down a clerk.
Following a failed, union-backed effort last year to strictly regulate self-checkout machines, California Democrats are trying again to set guidelines that they say will improve the efficiency of self-service stations across the state’s grocery, drug and big box stores. 
Senate Bill 442, from Los Angeles Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, who chairs the Senate committee on labor and public employment, would require stores to have at least one dedicated worker there to help self-service customers. Stores would also be required to operate at least one traditional staffed checkout lane at all times and restrict the type and number of items a customer could bring through self-checkout.
“This is about supporting our workforce, to make sure that they’re safe, but mostly to also make sure that they’re providing the level of service that customers expect and deserve,” said Smallwood-Cuevas on the Senate floor earlier this summer before the bill passed that chamber 26-10. 
But the state’s business community, especially its grocers, still opposes the effort. Instead, without pointing to concrete studies or evidence, they say more regulations will drive up prices due to added labor costs that companies will pass along to consumers.
“This seems like a clear example of why Californians pay the highest prices for groceries, regardless of what checkout line they go through,” said Daniel Conway, a lobbyist for the California Grocers Association, at an Assembly Labor and Employment Committee hearing in June. 
It’s not surprising that  Smallwood-Cuevas, a former labor organizer herself, is carrying such a bill given her close alignment with the two union heavyweights cosponsoring the legislation: the California Labor Federation and the United Food and Commercial Workers. She votes their way more than 95% of the time, according to the Digital Democracy database, and has received nearly $30,000 in total campaign contributions from the groups since 2021. 
Under the measure, stores would have to display signs that limit customers to 15 items or fewer in the self-checkout lanes and also designate one employee whose only assigned duties are to monitor the stands. Notably, the bill explicitly states that stores would not be penalized for failing to enforce the item limit, a condition that the business groups say is nonsensical. Proponents of the provision argue that signs will increase peer pressure and self-policing without strict enforcement.
More items banned from self-checkout
And building on a 2011 law that banned the sale of alcohol at self-checkout stations, another union-backed effort, Smallwood-Cuevas’s new bill would expand the ban to any items that require identification to buy, such as tobacco products, and anything with anti-theft security devices that must be removed by an employee.
Stores that want to add new self-service checkout stations must notify employees and their unions in writing at least 60 days in advance or face a $1,000 penalty per violation per day. 
Democrats have largely voiced support for Smallwood-Cuevas’s bill, calling it a much needed remedy for the headache that is self-checkout. 
Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a San Jose Democrat, scoffed at Conway’s assertion that self-checkout is an efficient and preferable choice for customers and said customers are often forced to use them since stores have reduced the number of cashiers. 
“I don’t know if I can disagree with more points that were just made from our friends with the grocers,” Kalra told Conway during the late June hearing. “You must not be going to the stores if you think there’s an improved shopping experience from these self-checkouts.”

Opponents have expressed concern that a newly added provision in the bill would invite local municipalities to pass their own more stringent standards, as the city of Long Beach recently did, requiring stores to assign at least one clerk for every three self-checkout machines. 
Companies warn that such a patchwork of laws would make it difficult to run stores with multiple locations, creating a burden for both owners and customers.
“Only a uniform, statewide approach can provide the consistency that both employers and employees need to thrive,” wrote Ryan Allain, a lobbyist for the California Retailers Association, which is currently opposed to the bill.
Even though Republicans admitted that they, too, despise the self-checkout process, lawmakers slammed the bill for overstepping businesses’ authority to regulate themselves and raise operating costs that would ultimately be passed along to the consumer. 
Sen. Shannon Grove, Republican of Bakersfield, called it “completely unacceptable” for the Legislature to prevent businesses from introducing automation that could lower costs after committing to an affordability agenda.  
“It’s a labor thing, I get it,” said Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, on the Senate floor in June. “I’d like as many people to work as possible, but I’d also like to afford the groceries.”
Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from El Segundo, was among a few Democrats who expressed slight hesitations about the state preemption of local rules but voted for the bill anyway. 
“I understand you’re going to be working with the grocers on that challenge,” he said in June. 
The bill must clear the Assembly Appropriations Committee after lawmakers return from their summer recess on Aug. 18 before it goes to the floor for a vote.

(Photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — More than 300 South Carolinians donated organs last year. Under a federal rule newly set for enforcement, the nonprofit that coordinates transplants across most of the state could fold, putting lives in the hands of out-of-state coordinators, the group’s leaders said.
We Are Sharing Hope SC ranks among the lowest-performing organ procurement organizations in the country under the 2022 rule, which was meant to ensure as many viable organs as possible are transplanted.
But the rating is an unfair measure in a state where so many people lack health care, said David DeStefano, the nonprofit’s president.
If federal regulators shut down the organization — Sharing Hope for short — nonprofits from other states would be able to make their case to the federal government as to why they should take over South Carolina’s organ donations, a role that involves talking to families, getting donors to transplant centers and finding hospitals with patients able to receive the donated organs.
According to the federal agency responsible for the new rule, the change is a way of pushing organ procurement organizations to do better after years of little oversight and no competition. If a procurement organization isn’t meeting federal standards, then another should come in and make changes, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
But replacing Sharing Hope and its 100 employees won’t solve the problems the state-specific nonprofit is facing. It could instead cause disruptions in the system, potentially leading to fewer people deciding to donate, DeStefano said.
Sharing Hope’s federal contract covers all but two of the state’s counties. Donations from Edgefield and Aiken counties are handled by LifeLink Georgia. They are among 56 such nonprofits nationwide.
“I can imagine few things worse than having an (organ procurement organization) from out of this state who doesn’t understand the intricacies, the subtleties, the culture, the people, the environment, trying to run something as intimate and personal as end-of-life donation,” DeStefano said.
More than organs
Sharing Hope was there as soon as 4-year-old Bo Worthy’s parents decided they wanted to donate his organs.

Worthy, an autistic child who loved blankets and had recently started speaking, drowned last month after climbing into the family pool during a brief moment he was unsupervised.
His parents found him unresponsive and rushed him to the hospital, where he was declared brain dead, said Rainee Brewer, Worthy’s second cousin and the family’s designated spokesperson.
Sharing Hope representatives explained the process to Worthy’s parents, answered their questions and stayed in the hospital room as long as possible to make sure the grieving family had everything they needed, Brewer said.
When Worthy’s family decided to hold a “donor walk,” which generally involves friends and family walking a person from the hospital room to the operating room, Sharing Hope helped organize it. In Worthy’s case, more than 300 people showed up to give him a sendoff. So Sharing Hope employees fit them all in the hospital’s hallways to greet Worthy’s hospital bed as it wheeled past, Brewer said.
A Sharing Hope representative even drove to Bojangles restaurants in search of signs printed with the company’s slogan, “It’s Bo Time,” which had become a common saying among the family.
“I felt like (Sharing Hope) really got us through one of the toughest and hardest weeks of our lives,” Brewer said. “I don’t know if we would have actually been able to do that without them.”
That work represents the procurement organization’s central mission, DeStefano said.
The ultimate goal, of course, is for the organs donated to end up with a patient in need, but the procurement organization also plays a major role in guiding families through the donation process and coordinating with hospitals to be sure the organ arrives safely, he said.
He worries whether a nonprofit from another state would have that same touch for the people it serves, or the relationships with hospitals to meet those sorts of requests.
“We are kind of the conduit to that process,” DeStefano said.
‘A foggy lens’
An estimated 4,100 people nationally die each year while waiting for an organ transplant, according to the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. At the same time, 28,000 organs that might have helped those people and others went unused, a 2017 study found.
Part of the problem was that organ procurement organizations falling below national standards had little reason to improve. The organizations operate “essentially as government-granted monopolies,” with little punishment for failing to meet standards and no competition to encourage better numbers, the study found.
Encouraging the nonprofits to pursue “every organ, every time,” as the study put it, was the main goal behind changing the way in which procurement organizations are judged, according to the rule. Under the change, regulators judge the organizations on how many potential donors had at least one organ transplanted, as well as how many organs set for donation successfully went to a recipient. The calculations are based on death certificates.
But DeStefano said those metrics fail to capture the complicated reality of organ donation.
“We need improvement,” DeStefano said. “We need transparency. We need all of us to continue to get better. But we need to do it the right way.”
The pool of potential organ donors starts out small, with about 3 in every 1,000 deaths qualifying for donation, according to the Heath Resources and Services Administration.
A person’s age, health and manner of death — including whether they died in the hospital — all matter for the viability of their organs, said Dr. Tim Whelan, a lung transplant surgeon and medical advisor for Sharing Hope. Any person under the age of 75 who dies of heart failure, a loss of blood flow to the brain, or a cause unrelated to their own health — such as a drug overdose, suicide or drowning — counts as a potential donor under the new rule.
That puts an aging, unhealthy, rural state such as South Carolina at a disadvantage, DeStefano and Whelan said.
Last year in South Carolina, 1,141 deceased patients either registered ahead of their deaths or had family members agree to donation. Sharing Hope transplanted a total of 305 organs, about one-quarter of the total possible, according to the nonprofit’s annual report.
A transplant center might reject a patient’s organs for any number of reasons, Whelan said.
Patients may die of a heart attack, making them a potential donor. But if they die far from a hospital, their organs deteriorate before they can be donated. Patients may have a medical condition not listed on their death certificate that disqualifies them from donating. And patients without access to health care may die with an undetected or untreated disease that wreaked havoc on their organs to the point that they would no longer be viable.
All of those cases would count against Sharing Hope, even if the reasoning was out of the nonprofit’s control, Whelan and DeStefano said.
“That’s been one of my great frustrations, is we are a great organization that’s not getting the credit because we’re looked at through a foggy lens,” DeStefano said.
The changes are not meant to hurt procurement organizations but “to ensure that donated organs are not wasted and reach those waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant,” the rule reads.
The number of donors has gone up in the years since the rule went into effect. In 2021, 24 of the nation’s 56 organ procurement nonprofits fell into the lowest of three performance tiers. By 2023, the most recent data available, that had dropped to 10.
Sharing Hope is one of those 10.
“It is our goal to ensure that (organ procurement organizations) are held to a high level of performance expectations and that all (procurement organizations) are pushed to perform better,” the rule reads.
What happens next
What Sharing Hope really needs is more donors.
During a review of its 2023 transplants, regulators determined that 46 more donors would be the difference between automatically losing certification and being able to make its case for remaining in charge of the state’s donations, according to federal data.
Last year, Sharing Hope received organs from 305 donors living and dead, the most in its history. Whether the nonprofit will reach the threshold to keep operating next year is unclear. Whelan was optimistic that the organization had improved enough to make the cut, while DeStefano remained unsure.
The nonprofit’s leaders are wary of putting too much pressure on families to donate in order to satisfy federal regulators. By design, organ procurement organizations are not meant to face the same performance pressures as hospitals so that families feel more freedom to make their own decisions, DeStefano said.
Coordinators could also try to be more selective about donors in an effort to bolster the ratio of organs the nonprofit successfully transplants, but that could mean missing out on a one-in-a-million match that doesn’t necessarily look good on paper, Whelan said.
For instance, Sharing Hope usually avoids transplanting smokers’ lungs, but every once in a while, one fits a patient who has otherwise been difficult to match, he said. If that lung worked out, it could save a person’s life. If it didn’t, that would ding the nonprofit’s score with federal regulators, Whelan said.
Short of changing the way organ donations are measured, giving the nonprofit more resources could be a better way of improving its numbers than trying to start over completely, Whelan and DeStefano said. Over the years, the nonprofit’s staff has built relationships with hospitals, which a new organization would have to rebuild, Whelan said.
Organ donation is such a personal decision, he worries bringing in a new organization could fracture people’s trust in the system, leading in turn to fewer organ donations, he said.
“The goal really should be to try to give us the tools to improve on those metrics,” Whelan said.
Sharing Hope’s work goes far beyond the hospital or the transplant center. After Worthy’s donation, staff members sent his parents letters to tell them where his heart, liver, kidneys and pancreas ended up.
Worthy’s heart continues to beat in a 9-month-old baby, Brewer said.
“That child has life because of Bo,” Brewer said. “That in itself is a beautiful thing.”

Gov. Newsom should still keep California's redistricting process independent because it's what voters wanted.,"Guest Commentary written by

Jeanne Raya
Jeanne Raya is the head of an insurance agency and lives in San Gabriel. She was the chair of California’s first independent redistricting commission.


In 2008, the Voters First Act created California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission, an independent body consisting of people who reflect the state’s diversity. Good government groups pushed the ballot measure forward, seeking to make sure voters were put first. I served on the first commission two years later.
Voter approval of an independent commission effectively ended the backroom political gerrymandering that characterized redistricting in California for decades. 
Commission members drew new maps with full transparency, giving citizens access to more than 100 public meetings and different ways to submit written comments. Voters could describe their communities, their environment, their infrastructure and their economy, so the commission could create districts giving them a fair chance at electing accountable representatives.  
Drawing fair maps was a challenging yet rewarding experience that took nearly a year to complete. Now California’s commission is considered the gold standard for redistricting, free of partisan self-interest and conducted fully in public view.  
If only Texas could learn from California. There, legislators’ current attempt to rig the 2026 election in favor of Republicans — at the behest of President Donald Trump — represents the basest self-interest of officials so fearful of losing power, all they can think to do is cheat. 
Their determination to stack the congressional deck prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to threaten retaliatory mid-cycle redistricting in California, to elect more Democrats. He proposes sidelining the independent commission and holding a special election to approve new maps drawn by legislators “just this once.”  
As a registered Democrat, I would celebrate replacing members of Congress who have forgotten their oath to serve constituents and protect the Constitution. But it can’t be at the expense of California’s Constitution — nor its voters, who mandated fair, nonpartisan redistricting.  
Newsom says the threat by Texas Republicans calls for a retaliatory strike. We witness daily the chaos and mistrust created by revenge politics in Washington. That is not the model of responsible government Californians deserve. It’s not worth us expending millions of taxpayer dollars to gamble that different congressional districts will produce the sought-after change. 
Does the governor want to risk losing incumbents in more competitive districts or failing to elect the magic number of Democrats needed to win this electoral war against Texas — and who knows how many other red states?  
Newsom says if the American people are given a fair chance, a voice and a choice, Democrats can take back Congress. In California, the people already have that chance — it’s the independent redistricting commission.  
We know that maps are already being drawn in California while Newsom waits for Texas to pull the trigger. But maybe he should consider a different response to redistricting warfare. 
Rep. Kevin Kiley proposed legislation to ban mid-decade redistricting nationwide. I don’t know what brought Kiley, a Placer County Republican, to this moment, but considering a national solution to a national problem would be a welcome undertaking.  
Californians should demand that Newsom and legislative leaders respect the will of the people and not sacrifice the independent redistricting commission, nor the state’s limited financial resources, for short-term political gain. the State’s limited financial resources, for short-term political gain.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/032619-Fair-Maps-Redistricting-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706

As Gov. Gavin Newsom moves forward with his redistricting plan to counteract Texas’ push to eliminate five Democratic seats in Congress, Republican Rep. Ken Calvert decries the proposal that puts his seat at risk. 



Last year Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, the longest-serving Republican of California’s delegation, narrowly held his seat against a former federal prosecutor, Democrat Will Rollins.
This year he faces eight challengers, and the possibility that his area, California District 41, could be redrawn to give Democratic candidates the advantage.
Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing what lawmakers are calling an emergency redistricting plan for California, aimed at turning at least five red congressional seats blue. Calvert’s Inland Empire district is one of those targets.
Newsom floated his plan after Texas began redrawing its political lines to eliminate five Democratic seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is pushing the proposal with the backing of President Donald Trump, who wants to bolster the GOP’s House majority in next year’s midterm election by skewing voting districts in Republicans’ favor.
“Donald Trump called up Governor Abbott for one simple reason: to rig the 2026 elections,” Newsom said in a statement, vowing to “fight fire with fire.”
But he faces some hurdles. Unlike Texas, where the legislature sets political boundaries, California relies on an independent citizens’ commission to draw voting lines. California voters approved the redistricting commission for state offices in 2008, empowering the bipartisan body to set boundaries based on geographic areas and “communities of interest,” which can include cultural and economic characteristics. In 2010, voters added congressional districts to the process.
To circumvent that, Newsom would ask California voters to approve new boundaries that would remain in place through 2030. He plans to release proposed voting maps next week. Then the state legislature has to authorize a ballot measure by Aug. 22 to place the redistricting plan on the November ballot.
Last week Newsom hosted Texas lawmakers who fled the state to delay a vote on its redistricting effort. And on Monday he sent Trump a letter outlining California’s counteroffensive. “You are playing with fire, threatening to destabilize democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make,” Newsom wrote.
Although the governor has been leading the charge for redistricting, his office said the legislature is handling the maps. “That is not something our office is actively involved in,” Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, told CalMatters in an email.

Calvert didn’t comment on how the redistricting proposal would affect his district, but said the plan undermines California’s citizen-led redistricting process.
“I strongly oppose the scheme being orchestrated behind closed doors by Sacramento politicians to take constitutionally afforded power away from the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission and replace it with a process that would allow legislators to draw district maps that are gerrymandered to benefit themselves and their political allies,” Calvert said in a statement to CalMatters. “A partisan political gerrymander is not what the voters of California want as they clearly stated when they passed the VOTERS FIRST Act and participated in the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission process.”
If voters approve the new maps it could put Calvert’s seat at risk. Previous redistricting in 2021 added the liberal Coachella Valley to conservative parts of western Riverside County, making it a more competitive race. Rollins brought a tightly run campaign and $8 million war chest to the fight and lost by just 3% in November. 
With even more Democrat-friendly boundaries and a wide field of candidates that include business executives, an educator and a pop star, the swing race would likely attract renewed national attention and campaign donations.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052725_Ken-Calvert-TM-GETTY-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that a group of veterans and labor unions were not entitled to a preliminary injunction that would have blocked DOGE access to their sensitive personal records.
The ruling, by a divided three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, affirms the same court’s decision in April, when it lifted an injunction by the U.S. District Court for Maryland that had temporarily blocked access to the personal records as a potential invasion of privacy.
The circuit court said the plaintiffs in the case — six veterans and five professional organizations — had not shown that they would suffer actual harm if their personal information was shared with officials from DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency set up by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, supposedly to ferret out government waste.
Tuesday’s ruling in American Federation of Teachers v. Scott Bessent marked the second time this summer that the Trump administration has successfully gone to court to lift an injunction in a case out of Maryland that would have stalled DOGE access to personal records.
The U.S. Supreme Court in June granted a stay in a nearly identical case — Social Security Administration v. AFSCME — on similar grounds, ruling that the government, not the plaintiffs, would be harmed if DOGE workers were denied access to government records while the case proceeded through the courts.
In a sharply worded dissent to the June order, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the government failed to show that it would be harmed by letting the injunction stay in place while the case was heard, beyond the fact that “it cannot be bothered to wait for the litigation process to play out before it proceeds as it wishes.” Granting the stay would give DOGE access to what Jackson called “a repository of millions of Americans’ legally protected, highly sensitive information that — if improperly handled or disseminated — risks causing significant harm.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Today the Court grants ’emergency’ relief that allows the Social Security Administration (SSA) to hand DOGE staffers the highly sensitive data of millions of Americans,” Jackson wrote in the June 6 order.
The most recent case involves records in the Treasury, the Department of Education and the Office of Personnel Management, each of which was working to provide DOGE with access to government records on individuals, under an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on his first day in office.
The agencies were sued by AFT, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees, the National Association of Federal Employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and six individual veterans. They claimed that “they or their members have personally identifiable information housed in the agencies’ databases and … that disclosing the information to the agencies’ DOGE-affiliated employees would violate both the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.”
They sought a preliminary injunction to keep the agencies from granting DOGE access to the records while the case was pending. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman agreed, issuing the injunction on March 24.
But the circuit court this week disagreed. It said a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only when the plaintiffs can show that they are likely to prevail on all of the issues they raise, and said the plaintiffs here failed to do so.
In particular, the appellate panel said it was not clear the plaintiffs had standing to sue, since they had not shown a “concrete injury” from release of their information to DOGE officials. And their claim that sharing the data violates the Privacy Act ignores the fact that the act “allows records to be shared intra-agency with ‘those officers and employees of the agency … who have a
need for the record in the performance of their duties.'”
DOGE employees would have had such a need, wrote Judge Julius Richardson for the panel, in order to carry out the “broad and open-ended duty” in the executive order that they “improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems.”
Supreme Court opens door to large-scale federal layoffs

Richardson was careful to note that “we do not hold with certainty that Plaintiffs lack standing” or that the Privacy Act does not apply or that any of their other claims will fail on closer inspection.
“We instead come to a statistically surer conclusion: that Plaintiffs have failed, by a decent margin, to show that they will likely prevail on all of these issues combined,” Richardson wrote. “The district court abused its discretion in finding that Plaintiffs were likely to prevail on each one, and with such certainty that they were likely to succeed overall.”
The appeals court sent the case back to Boardman for further consideration.
In a dissent, Judge Roger King said Boardman’s original injunction was limited and well-reasoned, temporarily limiting access to information that “includes Social Security numbers, income and assets, federal tax records, disciplinary and other personnel actions, physical and mental health histories, driver’s license information, bank account numbers, and demographic and family details.”
King wrote in April that Boardman’s injunction halted “what appears to be the illegal intra-governmental disclosure of highly sensitive personal information. Even a momentary lapse in the preliminary injunction preventing that disclosure could irreparably harm the plaintiffs” by granting “unfettered, unauthorized access to the highly sensitive personal data of millions of Americans, including veterans.”
He said Tuesday that the majority was right to say a preliminary injunction requires a high bar, but that it erred when “it conjures up an even higher one” that the district court could not meet.
“Contrary to the panel majority, the district court did exactly what it was obliged to do,” King wrote. “Specifically, in its thorough and cogent Opinion, the district court separately assessed the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the contested merits issues” and determined that they were likely to prevail and should be granted an injunction.

The Alabama Aerospace and Aviation High School (AAHS) opened in Bessemer in 2022. The school’s founder, Ruben Morris, previously applied to have the commission approve a new location in May and was denied.
AAHS is open to students in 9th through 12th grade interested in aviation, aerospace and other STEM pathways. The school graduated their first class of 13 students including three student pilots and four mechanics. AAHS ended the previous school year with 146 students enrolled.
Morris told commissioners Monday that he planned to open a new AAHS location at the Birmingham Southern College campus and collaborate with Miles College to increase academic rigor and talked about expanding coursework to include artificial intelligence.
“We’ll utilize an already existing dual enrollment agreement to act as a key catalyst expanding access to advanced computer science education for students,” Morris said.
Morris told the APCSC he had over 80 families interested in a Birmingham location. But commissioners were concerned he wouldn’t have enough enrollment for a new campus. The commission said the Bessemer location  failed to meet the projected enrollment of 365 students.
“The big elephant in the room is if you fail to meet enrollment when you first opened, and you’ve just said more than once that you have 80-plus students ready, 80-plus students is a long way from 145, 165, or even 365 [students],” Sharon Porterfield, a member of the commission, said.
Morris said the Bessemer school is not allowed to use the upstairs portion of the building in which it operates and is not allowed to place portable classrooms on the property.
Commissioners also said they were worried about the retention of students at AAHS due to the school starting the year with about 170 to 200 students and ending with fewer than that.
Morris told commissioners student retention at the Bessemer campus could be low in part because some students leave once they aren’t selected to be a student to fly planes and receive a private pilot license, while others choose to leave because they don’t fit the culture of the school.
But commissioners from the APCSC still remained concerned about enrollment rates and worried about how a new campus would affect the enrollment at the Bessemer location.
“I worry a bit that opening one school, at least at this point, before you build enrollment, up at that Bessemer campus and get to capacity and have waiting lists. That it could actually hurt that Bessemer campus in enrollment, and in growth and strength,” Commissioner Cynthia McCarthy said.
Birmingham City Schools also urged for the denial of the charter school due to a lack of success in major areas.
“Your original ruling was based on well-documented deficiencies across all major areas,” Cedric Tatum, a representative for Birmingham City Schools said. “Including the educational plan, the operational plan and financial plan. And also based on the data that was available at the time.”
Tatum said there was also no demand from the community for AAHS in Birmingham and students in the area did not show they were ready to attend the school.
“No parents or community members attended the public hearings that we provided, and there was no indication that there were any students that were ready to actually attend this school in Birmingham City,” he said.
AAHS will have their first day of school in Bessemer for the 2025-2026 school year on Aug. 18.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706
,California,2025-08-13 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California was a model for transparency. Now the Capitol operates in the dark,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/california-transparency-capitol-operates-dark/,"California once led the nation in government transparency. But as one-party rule emerged and the Capitol press corps shrank, lawmakers have increasingly operated in the dark. Several pending bills could expand their secrecy.","California was once a national leader in requiring public officials to conduct their business — really our business — in public.
Beginning with the Ralph M. Brown Act of 1953, which imposed strict limits on secret meetings by local governments, California’s Legislature adopted several “sunshine bills,” as they were dubbed. The Bagley-Keene Act extended the Brown Act’s open meeting requirements to state agencies, while the Public Records Act guaranteed access to all but a few documents state and local agencies maintained.
However, while the Legislature was willing to have the sun shine on others, it largely exempted itself. Thus, “caucuses” could meet behind closed doors to decide the fate of legislation, essentially scripting what would be said in open sessions before voting. Legislative appropriations committees could — and did — secretly decide which bills would reach the floors of both houses and just announce the winners and losers without explanation.
At one time, legislative secrecy was kept in check, more or less, by having two political parties and a substantial corps of reporters. Party leaders could reveal what their rivals were cooking up and reporters could penetrate clandestine deal-making through sources.
However, as California became dominated by one party and the Capitol press corps shrank due to upheavals in media industries, secrecy became more entrenched.
A case in point is the current effort by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislators to draw new maps for the state’s 53 congressional districts with the aim of capturing enough new seats to offset the Republican gerrymandering of Texas congressional districts. California’s new maps are being drafted in secret, a sharp contrast with the months-long public deliberations four years ago of the state’s redistricting commission, resulting in the current maps.
Apparently, the new maps will be revealed briefly before the Legislature votes to place them on a November special election ballot. There are no plans to allow them to be modified before adoption.
What’s happening vis-à-vis redistricting is right in line with the Capitol’s penchant for doing the public’s business in private.
Another example, as CalMatters revealed last year, is an unwritten rule that prohibits legislators from actually discussing changes in their bills during committee meetings, essentially rendering such hearings to meaningless charades.
Still another is the massive project to build a new annex to the Capitol itself. The Legislature has exempted the project from the California Environmental Quality Act and refuses to release details on what is being built or its costs, which appear to be massive, despite the state’s chronic, multibillion-dollar budget deficits. It has also required persons involved in the project to sign non-disclosure pledges to keep details secret.
A pending measure, Assembly Bill 1392, would exempt home addresses of public officials and political candidates from being revealed. While touted as a safety measure, it would make it impossible for journalists to determine whether officials actually live in the districts they represent — something that has popped up numerous times.
Legislators also want to make local government activities less transparent.
One measure now pending in the Capitol, Assembly Bill 699, is the latest of several efforts to allow proponents of local bond measures to omit tax consequences from ballot summaries, but rather place them in voter pamphlets, making them less prominent.
Closing the circle that began with passage of the Brown Act in 1953, Senate Bill 707 would make it easier for some local agencies to conduct their meetings via the internet rather than in person, thus making it easier to mute criticism from the public.
While California’s dominant Democrats often accuse President Donald Trump of undermining democracy, their growing desire for secrecy is equally abhorrent.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/082222-CA-Capitol-08-22-RL-CM-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706

In all of 2024, the total number of Washingtonians with concealed carry licenses increased by fewer than 6,000, compared to about 14,000 already this year, state data show.
By the end of July, Washington had 713,195 active concealed pistol licenses, known as CPLs, according to the state Department of Licensing. That’s up from 699,000 licenses to start the year and equivalent to about one license for every 11 residents.

 
Dave Workman, editor-in-chief of the Second Amendment Foundation’s TheGunMag.com, has been tracking concealed pistol license numbers in Washington since 2013. Usually, more people getting CPLs is tied to a fear of rising crime. But crime dropped significantly in 2024, the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs recently reported.
Still, the feeling of being unsafe remains for those on both sides of the political spectrum, Workman believes.
“You see these stories about shootings or stabbings on the heels of reports that Seattle has lost several hundred officers since 2020,” he said. “People look at that and they think, and I think rightfully so, that they have to take more responsibility for their own safety.”
Each month since May has set a new high for active licenses, after the numbers sputtered for a couple years. The number of license holders grew more than 3,800 in July alone. And April saw the most new licenses added in a single month since 2022.
Workman expects the trend to continue.
State lawmakers in April approved House Bill 1163, which will require those looking to buy guns to apply for a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol. 
Applicants will have to pay a fee and have completed a certified firearms safety training program within the past five years, with limited exceptions. Majority Democrats pushed through the controversial legislation amid staunch pushback from gun rights advocates.
The permit system, set to take effect in May 2027, goes beyond the state’s existing background checks, which also require proof of completion of a firearm safety course.
As long as applicants aren’t the subject of an arrest warrant or barred from having guns in the first place, state patrol will have to approve their permit if they meet specific criteria. 
The same currently goes for concealed pistol licenses. Applications can’t be denied, as long as the applicant is at least age 21, is allowed to have a gun and meets some other requirements.
Under the new law, CPL applicants will also need to prove they’ve done a firearm safety program. 
The law, expected to face legal challenges, is the latest in a series of moves legislators have made in the past few years to try to reduce gun violence and suicides.
“And what does the public do?” Workman said. “They turn right around. They buy guns. They go get concealed pistol licenses. It’s like they’re telling the gun control crowd, ‘Hey, bugger off.’”
Since February, Grant, Whatcom, Pend Oreille, Pierce and Mason counties have seen the biggest percentage jumps in licensees. King County, which has the most license holders, also saw a more than 2% uptick in the past six months. The numbers dropped in only 10 of Washington’s 39 counties.

 
The National Rifle Association said the state’s gun control efforts, “coupled with a soft-on-crime agenda, have created a dangerous scenario where law-abiding citizens must jump through administrative hoops to exercise their constitutional rights.”
“Despite these arduous hurdles, more Washingtonians than ever are arming themselves, because they understand that their family’s safety is in their own hands,” said John Commerford, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, in a statement.
Gregory Joseph, communications director for the Seattle-based Alliance for Gun Responsibility, disagrees. He said that, “while more firearms in circulation can increase risk, we believe Washington’s approach to firearm safety makes our communities tangibly safer.”
The permit-to-purchase law will “ensure that those carrying firearms in public are well-trained and continuously vetted, helping to prevent prohibited individuals from possessing firearms,” Joseph said. “By raising the bar for training and oversight, Washington state is making responsible ownership the standard and improving safety for everyone in Washington.”

Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger told the State Board of Education Tuesday that she was glad to see an end to the “nosedive” that scores took between 2018 and 2023. But she knows the state can do better.
“Now we are seeing an uptick. It takes a lot to see even a percent of an uptick,” she told the board. “Are we where we need to be? Absolutely not.”
Pamela Westbrooks-Hodge, a board member from Pasadena Hills, said she hoped to see more improvement.
“This just feels like we need to revisit our growth targets, understand what worked and figure out where we need to turn up the dial to our growth,” she said.
The results of the Missouri Assessment Program come in four categories: advanced, proficient, basic and below basic. Grade-level equivalence, which is required to be reported in next year’s results, contains scores in the basic and proficient ranges.
In English language arts, 44% of students scored proficient or advanced, compared to 49% in 2019.
Math performance improved, with the lowest number of students scoring “below basic” in recent years. As a whole, 44% of students scored in the proficient or advanced range in math, beating 2019’s level of 41%.
But the achievement gap remains wide. 
The state education department tracks the scores of students who are Black, English learners, free-and-reduced lunch recipients, Hispanic or those with an individualized education plan as a group. The group scores in the proficient or advanced range at less than half the rate of students outside those groups.
Missouri school districts show improvement in annual performance report

The board, with a tone of disappointment, spent part of Tuesday’s meeting examining ways to improve student achievement. The discussion often veered to low attendance rates.
“We have school districts with 49% attendance and that, to me, is not acceptable. So we’ve got to do something about attendance,” Eslinger said.
Her main areas of focus, she said, are literacy and attendance as mechanisms to boost performance.
“We need to truly, truly work on attendance and literacy,” Eslinger said. “And then I do think that we need to look at how we measure progress.”
The current way of measuring performance is too slow, she said, adding that she wants more granular data.
Educators have long been expressing the same sentiment. Standardized test results are one of the factors that determine school districts’ state accreditation and are often cited by lawmakers and researchers to advocate for policy change. But educators compare the test to an “autopsy,” showing what has happened in the past but not providing real-time performance data.
School leaders have advocated for a shift to benchmark assessments, instead of the MAP’s summative format. And schools in the Success Ready Students Network, which is exempt from the state’s accreditation process, have been testing new ways to monitor student performance.
At the end of July, the department announced that the whole state will move toward benchmark tests as part of the U.S. Department of Education’s Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority Program. The program will allow the state to pilot a new assessment system beginning in the 2025-26 school year.
The department is planning on a “small-scale pilot of approximately five (schools) serving an estimated 100 students each in grade four English language arts and grade five Mathematics,” according to its application submitted earlier this summer.
The new test, which the department is calling the Success Ready Student Assessment, will have a minimum of three checkpoints throughout the school year and is intended to provide more timely feedback to educators and students.
“It just gives us a lot more information,” Eslinger said. “It is so much better for our kids to be able to have that opportunity to really see what it is that they’ve learned and what they need to learn next.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tests-on-table.jpg,,,2025-08-13 07:58:30.557795

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)“Optically horrible.” A “hard no.” In “bad form.”
Hoosier leaders might be busy taking behind-the-scenes feedback on the prospect of early redistricting, but rank-and-file Republicans are increasingly going public with their opposition.
Statehouse lawmakers redraw districts after each decennial census. They last did so in 2021, and population data shows little change since then.
Indiana Democrats, meanwhile, are joining forces with their Texan counterparts to protest the move, just days after they led hundreds of Hoosiers in a rally to oppose early redistricting.
President Donald Trump is pushing Texas and other GOP-led states like Indiana to redistrict ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives for the rest of his second term.










I think it's bad form, I think it's inadvisable. It's probably contrary to Indiana law, and I've expressed my reservation about it to some of our elected leadership.


– Former GOP Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma


“On one hand, we feel unlikely as a candidate to approach redistricting. We’ve got seven out of our nine congressional districts (that) are solidly Republican,” said Laura Merrifield Wilson, a political science professor at the University of Indianapolis. “… You would think you would go after states where you get more than one.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan holds the state’s most competitive congressional district, located in northwest Indiana. The heavily Democratic, Indianapolis district held by Rep. André Carson would be a tougher flip.
But, Wilson said, that GOP strength is also what makes Indiana an “appealing” target from the federal perspective: a “very amenable, very friendly” executive in Gov. Mike Braun and legislative supermajorities in both of the Statehouse’s chambers.
“You’re looking at a state where you could reasonably get the support you need,” she added.
That’s if lawmakers actually want to do it.
Rank-and-file Republicans speak out
Gov. Mike Braun has stayed noncommittal on the possibility he’d call a special session for early redistricting. The next legislative session is set to organize for only one day in late November before coming back in January — possibly too late to finalize maps by February candidate filing deadlines. He’s looking to Texas — and Indiana’s own lawmakers.
Braun noncommittal on early redistricting; decision to depend on Texas action and Indiana lawmakers

The Indiana General Assembly has complete control in redrawing district lines. There’s no nonpartisan commission. A gubernatorial veto can be overturned with simple majority votes.
House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, who lead Republican supermajorities in the state’s House and Senate, haven’t yet made their stances clear. But members are.
Multiple have described themselves as a “hard no,” including Reps. Danny Lopez of Carmel and Jim Lucas of Seymour.
“Just a few years ago, our General Assembly undertook the complex redistricting process based on up-to-date census data, drawing fair maps that ensure every Hoosier vote counts,” Lopez, who took office last year, wrote on X. “We should stand by that work.”
Lucas called the possibility “highly unusual and politically optically horrible.”
“I don’t believe Republicans should stoop to the level of Democrats on this issue. Republicans hold about 90% of all local offices statewide and once the voter rolls get purged of illegals, we will hold an even more commanding lead,” he wrote on Facebook. “Democrats can’t compete with their Socialist policies and ideology and if there are seats that need targeted, we should do it the old fashioned way and campaign harder in those districts.”
Mooresville Rep. Craig Haggard emphasized that Indiana is a “solid Republican state” that has gone for Trump three times in a statement to the Capital Chronicle on Monday. He added that he’s been “hearing from constituents and I do not believe at this time there is an appetite for redistricting in our communities.”
  Indiana’s congressional district boundaries.
WEHT reported that Wadesville Sen. Jim Tomes doesn’t think redistricting is needed right now because the lines are fairly drawn. He similarly noted the GOP is in good shape for the midterms.
Wilson believes the risks are more severe for GOP legislators as opposed to Braun.
They “don’t want to be seen as anti-Trump,” but are “maybe most vulnerable (to) the criticism” since they’d be handling any redistricting legislation — and attaching their names to it.
Former GOP House Speaker Brian Bosma said he’s “glad” lawmakers are speaking up.
He oversaw the 2011 redistricting that involved hearing from constituents in nine different cities before crafting new maps, and was in the General Assembly through three redistricting cycles in all. He recalled how, as a brand-new floor leader in 1995, he resisted efforts to redraw Statehouse districts early.
“I think it’s bad form, I think it’s inadvisable. It’s probably contrary to Indiana law, and I’ve expressed my reservation about it to some of our elected leadership,” Bosma said. “The leaders I’ve talked to, and I’ve talked to the top down, are not thrilled about this prospect but because other states are expressing support for this, there’s pressure to do it.”
Democrats push to prevent
Across the aisle, meanwhile, Democrats hope to sway public opinion against early redistricting.
Members of the Indiana House Democratic Caucus are joining forces with their Texan counterparts to host a news conference in Illinois on Wednesday. Texas House Democrats fled the Lone Star State to block redistricting legislation there.
“Together, the two House Caucuses will explain the serious danger mid-term redistricting plans pose to the legitimacy of our democracy,” a news release said. “Democrats in Texas and Indiana will continue to stand up and reject Trump’s demands to rig an election.”
The Indiana Democratic Party has also been active.
Former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas drew hundreds to an Indianapolis town hall last Sunday, while hundreds more attended a Statehouse protest on Thursday that was headlined by Mrvan, Carson, and an array of state-level Democratic lawmakers.
Indiana Democratic Party Chair Karen Tallian noted both events were organized with “a couple days notice.” She hopes to keep that momentum going, and didn’t rule out the possibility of more rallies.

“We need public outrage and pressure before they ever make the decision that they’re going to call a special session,” she told the Capital Chronicle. “If you could prevent them from calling a special session, … that’s the best possible solution.”
Tallian, who served more than 15 years in Indiana’s Senate, maintains the current districts already offer Republicans outsized benefits, arguing the seven-two congressional split doesn’t reflect the Indiana electorate.
Voters generally went about 60%-40% in favor of statewide Republicans in the 2024 election.
“How greedy can you get? ‘Oh, they’ve got two. We want all of them,'” she said of the GOP.
Tallian said Democrats considered suing over redistricting in 2011 and 2021.
“Frankly, I’m still hoping that we can bring a gerrymandering lawsuit based on their current maps,” she said. “And now they want to come and do it again? It’s just, it’s outrageous.”
The Indiana Republican Party didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment on early redistricting.
Demographic change a factor
Some are open to the idea.
“Northwest Indiana, there’s a lot of people migrating there from the state of Illinois. It’s kind of the first stop over the border from Chicago, (a) good conservative state like Indiana,” Fort Wayne Rep. Bob Morris told WOWO last week.
“If we have an issue there, we’re going to have to get another, you know, essentially a census done in the state of Indiana by an independent source to see where the numbers are at,” he continued.
Mrvan’s 1st Congressional District includes Lake and Porter counties, as well as some of LaPorte County. The trio collectively grew by an estimated 5,824 people — less than 1% — between April 2020 and July 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Indiana, as a whole, added an estimated 137,688 people — almost 2%.
“There’s nothing to lead … me to believe, at least, that things would have changed so dramatically that the congressional districts are not adequately representing their constituents, and at the end of the day, that’s why redistricting matters,” Wilson said.

She called Indiana’s current congressional maps “sufficient” — not very competitive, but relatively compact and homogenous.
Wilson said any changes should be recorded and addressed via data from the next census.
“Every 10 years we do this — whether it’s going to be good for you or bad for you, whether you want to or you don’t,” she added. “… Changing that mechanism means in the future, there’s no precedent. You can say, ‘Well … we want to redraw this right this moment.”
Some fear an effort to flip seats could backfire.
“You can spread out your Republican vote a little too thin so that every few cycles, seats are going back and forth,” U.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana told Punchbowl News last month. “And that can sort of cut both ways.”
Others predict squigglier lines.
Bosma said efforts to capture blue districts could undo progress the GOP made in other cycles to make the districts more compact and keep political subdivisions — counties, towns, cities, school districts, fire districts and more — intact when possible.
Map-drawers could “divvy up” northwest Indiana and put Mrvan at risk, he said. They could “run fingers into the center of the city” of Indianapolis to take aim at Carson.
“But … it would not look right, and you’d have to do some pretty serious tap dancing to make it even remotely reasonable,” he said of the 7th District.
Marjorie Hershey, an emeritus political science professor at Indiana University, said it’s “tempting” to look at the early redistricting fight as a “strategic matter of who’s winning and who’s losing.”
She encouraged a broader view.
“Democracy is not self-enforcing. It never has been,” Hershey said. “Democracies do fail, they do die, and we have to take seriously the possibility that that could happen here. Each step has a tendency to make the next step not look quite so bad or quite so distant.”

If approved by both chambers, House Bills 4047 and 4048 would place criminal penalties on the creation and distribution of deep fakes depicting individuals in an intimate or sexual context, and would allow individuals to take civil action over the non-consensual creation of deepfake pornography. 
The six members of the committee in attendance voted unanimously to approve substitutes for the bills and to send the legislation back to the Senate floor for a vote.
Following the meeting, Committee Chair Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) told reporters the substitutes for the bill were intended to further clarify that companies whose technology is used to create deepfakes are not held liable and that the bills’ sponsors, Reps. Matt Bierlein (R-Vassar) and Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing), had given the substitutes their blessing.

This story was originally published by The 19th.
“In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” a pastor tells CNN. “And I would ordinarily be the one that would cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.”
Another agrees, saying he’d back an end to a woman’s right to vote: “I would support that, and I’d support it on the basis that the atomization that comes with our current system is not good for humans.”
The discussion of 19th Amendment rights was part of a news segment focused on Doug Wilson — a self-proclaimed Christian nationalist pastor based in Idaho — that was reposted to X by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The secretary is among Wilson’s supporters, and his involvement with Wilson’s denomination highlights how a fringe conservative evangelical Christian belief system that questions women’s right to vote is gaining more traction in the Republican Party.
Kristin Du Mez, a professor of history at Calvin University and author of “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,” said Wilson’s broader vision of Christian nationalism has gotten more attention over the past several years, alongside President Donald Trump’s rise to power.
“He was a fairly fringe figure, but this moment was really his moment,” she said. “And then as part of that, also, I think he signaled and gave permission to others that they didn’t need to hide some of their more controversial views, such as, should women have the vote? And that’s something that you didn’t hear proudly promoted from very many spaces, even just a handful of years ago.”
In the CNN interview, Wilson said he’d like to see the United States become a Christian and patriarchal country. He advocates for a society where sodomy is criminalized and women submit to their husbands and shouldn’t serve in combat roles in the military — a belief Hegseth has also publicly shared in the past though walked back during his confirmation hearings.
Hegseth appeared to support the nearly seven-minute interview with the caption, “All of Christ for All of Life.” Wilson has built an evangelical empire over the past 50 years that is centered in Moscow, Idaho, and now spans more than 150 congregations across four continents — including a new church in Washington, D.C. In July, Hegseth and his family attended the inaugural service at Christ Church, according to CNN.
“The Secretary is a proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson,” Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement to The 19th. “The Secretary very much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson’s writings and teachings.”
Du Mez said Wilson built his brand as a vocal critic of mainstream evangelicalism.
“They were too wishy washy,” Du Mez said, referring to Wilson’s view of much of White evangelicalism in the 1990s and early 2000s. “They were too soft. And so he was kind of bringing a harsher biblical truth, and that included things like a much more rigid application of biblical patriarchy. ”
In 2024, only 1 in 10 Americans qualified as Christian nationalism adherents, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.
Ryan Dawkins, an assistant professor of political science at Carleton College, said Christian nationalism hasn’t necessarily gotten more popular in the past 20 years. But there have been partisan trends.
“While they used to be more evenly divided between the two parties, over the last two decades, Christian nationalists have sorted into the Republican Party at incredibly high rates,” Dawkins said. “Christian nationalism is almost non-existent within the Democratic Party today, at least among White Democrats.”
While it’s still far from a mainstream opinion, several figures within the Republican Party have flirted with the idea of repealing the 19th Amendment.
Paul Ingrassia, who Trump nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, suggested approval for the idea in a 2023 podcast. Podcast host Alan Jacoby told Ingrassia that his own wife is the “biggest misogynist this side of the Mississippi, by the way. My wife literally thinks women should not vote.”
Ingrassia responded, “She’s very based,” a term expressing support for a bold opinion.
During the 2020 Republican National Convention, Republicans featured anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson, who has advocated for a new kind of voting system where households, not individuals, would cast votes. Head-of-household voting has historically disenfranchised women and people of color by concentrating power on the male leaders of the home.
In the leadup to the 2016 presidential election, FiveThirtyEight, a political forecasting site, shared data that suggested if women didn’t vote, Trump would win. The hashtag #repealthe19th — a reference to the 19th Amendment, which grants women the right to vote — quickly went viral.
And a former Trump-backed Michigan candidate for the U.S. House who has also held positions in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development was found to have made statements criticizing women’s suffrage while in college at Stanford University in the early 2000s. John Gibbs, now an assistant secretary at the agency, said that the country had been damaged by the 19th Amendment because women’s suffrage had led to an increase in the size and scope of the government. He added that women making up half of the population wasn’t enough reason for women’s suffrage. Gibbs’ 2022 congressional campaign denied he opposed women’s right to vote.
Kelly Marino, associate teaching professor at Sacred Heart University and author of “Votes for College Women: Alumni, Students and the Woman Suffrage Campaign” said that while conservative religious sects adamantly opposed to women’s suffrage have always existed, now there is renewed momentum.
“If you look at the way things played out in the past, we have this very liberal period followed by a conservative backlash,” Marino said. “And that’s what’s going on now. You have this period of liberalism where people were having a more expansive view of gender ideology, ideas about sexuality and women in politics. We had some pretty prominent female politicians that were making it pretty far in the last couple of years. And now there’s a backlash.”
Marino said the conservative backlash is reminiscent of the 1960s and 70s. There were significant progressive movements for civil rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights and environmental protections. But at the same time, the early 1970s saw the emergence of the men’s liberation movement, which focused primarily on issues like divorce law and child custody.
“There’s some men who are promoting a sort of return to tradition, a patriarchal vision for society,” Marino said. “It’s always sort of there, but it’s gaining traction within mainstream consciousness again. And now, you have all this stuff about soft girls and tradwives — this gender ideal of women being the domestic homemaker within a traditional family structure. There’s been a big push for this radical Christianity and some of its values — it’s become really popular even among younger people.”
Joseph Slaughter, an assistant professor of history at Wesleyan University, said Wilson is having his moment in the spotlight — but it’s important to remember that he does not speak for the majority.
“He delights in upsetting people or saying transgressive, un-PC things,” Slaughter said. “Ten years ago, when he posted a video talking about man’s biblical duties — people just sort of yawned and dismissed him. Now, he’s saying things and they’re gaining more currency because of some of this other new right-wing masculinity and the online manosphere.”
Slaughter said it’s particularly concerning that Wilson’s teachings have found their support in a man as powerful as Hegseth.
“What does it mean for somebody who’s running an organization which has had its struggles over the years integrating women and trying to understand existential questions about women’s role in combat?” Slaughter said. “Are Hegseth’s views reinforced by his religion now? Does this church reinforce his cultural chauvinism? For somebody in his position, it’s certainly fair game to ask.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/petehegseth-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 07:58:30.557795

(Getty Images)Long before the tornado siren starts going off, you know a storm is coming. The clouds roll in, the air changes, and the sky darkens. The warning signs of an economic downturn have been rolling in, with revised national jobs numbers showing a steep decline in hiring and companies pledging to raise prices due to tariffs. Surviving this impending economic storm depends in part on the preparation that precedes its arrival, and Indiana has work to do to be ready.
When a person is laid off from a job, our unemployment insurance system is the primary mechanism that keeps families afloat. Unemployment insurance is funded through contributions from employers and serves individuals who experienced a job loss through no fault of their own. The intention is that in the event of an unexpected job loss, unemployment benefits will prevent families from falling into poverty.
Unemployment insurance in the state of Indiana provides individuals a maximum benefit of $390 per week, or roughly $1,600 per month. A recent analysis put the average benefit at $327/week in January 2024, or 32% of the average weekly wage for Indiana workers. In that report, all of our neighbor states had higher average benefits than us, with Kentucky ($498/week) and Ohio ($456/week) replacing closer to 50% of an average worker’s wages. Still, at any of these replacement rates, an unemployed person will struggle to meet their basic needs while they try to get another job.
Indiana lawmakers contemplate slashing unemployment insurance timespan

In fact, Indiana’s maximum benefit falls below the poverty level for a family of two or more. Considering that fair market rent for a one-bedroom is over $1,000 in many locations in Indiana and that the average car payment is $521 (used) or $725 (new), Hoosiers will be hard-pressed to keep a roof over their heads and a working vehicle while they scour the job market. That leaves nothing for utilities, child care, health insurance, food, or other necessities.
The inability of unemployed workers to meet their basic needs doesn’t only affect Hoosiers who lose their jobs. There are landlords and mortgage lenders that won’t get paid, cars that will get repossessed, grocery stores that will see reduced spending, and medical bills that will pile up. Not being able to afford housing or transportation makes it harder for unemployed workers to secure and accept their next job offer because they don’t have a stable place to live or a reliable way to get to work. Failing to address the inadequacy of unemployment insurance benefits will have ripple effects that make it harder to rebound – especially at a time when many other supports are conditioned on meeting work requirements.
Beyond the family-sustaining purpose of these benefits, the unemployment insurance system is the doorway through which workers are connected to programs and tools that should propel their successful reentry into the workforce. With technology advancing rapidly and community needs constantly shifting, the jobs of yesterday are not necessarily going to be the jobs of tomorrow.
A robust unemployment system ensures that people can learn how the jobs landscape is changing and what skills they might need to secure high-wage jobs. It connects them to training opportunities and employment options. This connectivity becomes even more critical in turbulent times. A system with limited benefits that discourages participation also blocks access to these vital supports.
We can certainly debate whether a storm is coming and if we can control the weather. But we all share the goal of setting Hoosier workers, families, and businesses up to survive, and that means taking a hard look at our preparedness and making the appropriate adjustments.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A committee of South Dakota lawmakers endorsed a proposal Tuesday to provide more video livestreaming of the legislative process and heard how water-damaged technology could affect a special legislative session next month.
South Dakota Public Broadcasting — which is part of state government — already provides video livestreaming of state House and Senate floor sessions, as well as meetings of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee. Other committee rooms are only equipped for audio livestreaming.
The Legislature’s Executive Board, which met Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre, endorsed a $36,442 plan to put video livestreaming equipment in the other five committee rooms. The proposal will go to the full Legislature as part of a supplemental budget bill this winter.
House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, the chairman of the committee, advocated for the plan.
“For the transparency that it brings to this process, to be able to look and see the people presenting, to look at the presentations that are being presented, and also just the awareness of what’s going on in this building during the legislative session, I think it’s great,” Hansen said, “and I think it’ll only enhance that.”
Public broadcasting cuts discussed
Senate Majority Whip Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, asked whether South Dakota Public Broadcasting will have the capacity to handle the additional responsibility. The organization is considering budget cuts and layoffs after it lost about $2 million of annual support — roughly 20% of its budget — when Congress and President Donald Trump defunded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting last month.
Elijah Rodriguez, chief information technology officer for the Legislative Research Council, said he has assurances from South Dakota Public Broadcasting that it will be able to handle the additional video archiving and management of video livestreams on its SD.net website and YouTube, “regardless of whether they have staff cuts or not.”
House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, asked about the possibility of the Legislative Research Council taking over video livestreaming and archiving duties. The council’s director, John McCullough, said it would require the council to purchase equipment and hire additional staff.
“It could be absorbed,” McCullough said. “It would just cost money.” 
Water leaks damage House technology
Rodriguez updated the committee on damage caused by water leaks this summer in the House chamber’s technology equipment closets. He said the leaks occurred during large rainstorms in May and June while the roof was undergoing repairs. There was about $185,000 worth of damage, he said, which he hopes insurance will cover.
But there’s a four-month lead time on replacement equipment, which is all custom-built. Because of that, a Sept. 23 special session to consider a prison construction plan could be affected. Rodriguez said the electronic board that displays roll-call vote results in the House might not be available, and some representatives’ voting buttons at their desks might not work.
“We are building a contingency plan to have a workaround and still be able to operate in the House just in case that equipment isn’t fully functional,” Rodriguez said.

On July 23, JXN Water disconnected service to the complex in south Jackson, leaving about 20 families without access to running water. Now, the residents have orders to vacate.

Hundreds more Jacksonians could be forced from their homes if the private water utility continues a crackdown that has already led residents in two apartment complexes to flee. 
“We’re not gonna be able to move and pick up in five days,” Glasper said Saturday as officials scrambled to temporarily restore water and deal with the fallout. “We need more time.”
The utility has remained mum about the specific properties where it plans to discontinue service next, though concerned residents are encouraged to call JXN Water 601-500-5200 to get a status update on their property.
Glasper, 44, has lived at Blossom with her mother for four years. She said she doesn’t invite visitors because of safety concerns.
She said she has her eyes set on another complex, The Park at St. Andrews. But that apartment is also behind on its water bill, according to JXN Water.
The utility previously released a list of 15 complexes that had delinquent water bills of more than $100,000, plus 141 total accounts across the city are considered past due. Some of the properties have signed on to a payment plan. The utility said it has declined to name the complexes that have refused and could be at risk of shutoffs, “to avoid triggering confusion or panic among tenants.”
But advocates and caseworkers for low-income and homeless Jacksonians are bracing.
“This is in some ways starting to feel like a practice run,” said Jill Buckley, director of Stewpot Community Services, which is using a federal emergency housing grant to help Blossom residents relocate.

Mayor John Horhn secured a federal judge’s order last Friday temporarily restoring water to Blossom until Wednesday. Because the complex is a low-income housing development, oversight agency Mississippi Home Corporation stepped in, labeling the property unsafe and forcing residents to leave. 
 ”It really been like a horror movie. It kind of reminds me of Hurricane Katrina. People are running here and there trying to get water,” said Chante Robinson-Baxter, another Blossom tenant. She receives disability payments and has lived at the complex for 13 years.
Mississippi Home Corporation Director Scott Spivey, who has headed the agency for a decade, said it was the first time in his tenure it exercised this authority.
“I would love to say that there’s never going to be a next time but there’s going to be a next time,” Spivey said Tuesday.
Many of the low-income residents of these apartments have paid their water bills, combined with their monthly rent. The utility shut off water to residents at Blossom, claiming its owner owes $422,000, on July 23, followed by another south Jackson complex, Chapel Ridge, on Aug. 1. 
“I’ve just been pleading my case with JXN Water, ‘Please don’t displace these residents,’ because they’re doing what they’re supposed to do,” said Allison Cox, director of the Jackson Housing Authority, which administers federal housing vouchers to residents in Jackson, including one who lived at Blossom. 
JXN Water’s policy is to post signs notifying residents of impending shutoffs. But the utility’s spokesperson, Aisha Carson, said Blossom’s property manager removed the notices, “leading to confusion and misinformation among residents.”
Cox and JXN Water have been in constant contact, so she knows how much of a moving target the shutoffs have become. One day, she gets word that a complex might lose service. The next, the owner has signed a repayment agreement. 
“It’s changing all the time,” Cox said.
Tenants and advocates met Tuesday evening at Stewpot to discuss their options. If anything, the Blossom situation has demonstrated how community partners can mobilize to address shutoffs in the future.

Tonia Cowart, a local real estate agent and Stewpot’s housing navigator, said she uses all available resources – secretary of state’s office filings, county tax records, news reports and her own eyes – to vet units before placing her clients there. 
“My best work is done with boots on the ground, and I get up and go see, and I do this on a daily basis,” Cowart said.
Before JXN Water released the names of the 15 delinquent apartment complexes, though, she wouldn’t have known not to refer people there. 
Mississippi Today reached out to the 15 complexes on the list of highest delinquent accounts. The only response came from The Park at St. Andrews, with manager Reuven Oded saying the complex has been dealing with the Jackson water “saga” for years and tried unsuccessfully to resolve the issue.
“We are hopeful that now that the Federal Receiver is in place we will have all billing and usage matters resolved in the very near future,” Oded said in an email.
Blossom Apartments owner Tony Little’s troubles with JXN Water, including hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of charges he says are impossible, began more than a year ago. Little said he doesn’t have enough money to cover the bill.
“The bill is simply not correct, but today we’re talking about displaced tenants … It’s the actual people who are on the ground that we have to protect,” Little said. “This is no longer just about who’s right and who’s wrong.”
Carson said that while she cannot speak on individual accounts, JXN Water is now implementing two systems for transparency. 
Starting in September, the utility will be publishing a list of the 15 complexes with the largest outstanding balances, and it is also allowing call center staff to respond to requests for information on accounts if the resident can provide proof that they live in a particular complex. 
“We’re making this decision because tenants have to know ahead of time whether or not their apartment complex owner is behind on their water bill,” Carson said. “We want to be able to point them towards the source of truth about it.”

Here, smoke plumes and hurricane clouds are visible at once (photo courtesy of NASA Earth Observatory).The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump is seeking to rescind the EPA’s longstanding finding from 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare.
The EPA is making a truly radical move here.
The endangerment finding has been a linchpin to the agency’s regulatory actions over the years to deal with climate change. In announcing the move to rescind the finding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin boasted: “Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.” Zeldin is effectively waging war against what he disparagingly calls “the climate change religion.”
This latest EPA move on the endangerment finding must be placed in context.
The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act back in 2007. The court left it to the agency to make the required endangerment finding. And Congress recently reaffirmed the EPA’s endangerment finding when it passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
So, this action would be a dramatic change in EPA policy in defiance of Supreme Court precedent and an act of Congress. And the action prioritizes deregulation over the EPA core mission of protecting health and the environment.
All this is taking place in the wake of what I have called a “grand upheaval” in federal administrative law.
In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted a new set of administrative rules aimed largely at restricting the Biden Administration from implementing its regulatory policies.
The court took a three-pronged approach: (1) to interpret regulatory statutes narrowly against agency authority; (2) to bar regulations on what the Court deemed “major questions”; and (3) to overrule the Chevron deference formerly given to agencies when interpreting ambiguous statutes. The Court often targeted the EPA under this new approach.
In my opinion, the Supreme Court’s new restrictive view of agency authority could backfire on Zeldin as he wages his war on “the climate change religion.” The EPA will be hard-pressed to find substantial scientific evidence to support its political conclusion that the finding of endangerment no longer applies. The provocative notion about greenhouse gas emissions posing no serious adverse health risks is rooted in politics and not science.
I do not believe the EPA can justify such an erroneous finding under either the Administrative Procedure Act or the Clean Air Act.
For the EPA now to rescind its endangerment finding from 2009 is a “major question“ that Congress has not specifically delegated to the EPA as required by current Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, Zeldin shows this is a “major question” with his own hyperbolic boast about the effect of the decision. And finally, the EPA will get no Chevron deference for its proposed decision to deregulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.
We’ll likely find out soon if the Supreme Court will consistently stand by its new rules of federal administrative law. If not, you can draw your own conclusions about why.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/climate-change-Sept-2020-NASA-Earth.png,,,2025-08-13 06:56:40.740862

This story by Alex Hanson was first published in the Valley News on August 10.
WOODSTOCK — The board of the Woodstock-based Mountain Views Supervisory Union voted on Monday to join a Board of Cooperative Education Services (BOCES) with seven other supervisory unions and districts.
The unanimous vote makes Mountain Views the first supervisory union in the state to join a BOCES, a structure that’s in wide use in a majority of states but that wasn’t enabled under Vermont law until last year.
A BOCES allows school units to band together to share services that require greater expertise or that entail extra costs. Mountain Views Superintendent Sherry Sousa has been meeting with her seven counterparts for the past five years, a collaboration that has resulted in both cost savings and better services in special education and professional development.
“The southeast region is an incredibly collaborative group with shared goals and expectations for their students,” Sousa said in an interview.
Now that the region has crafted articles of agreement, officials hope that document can become a template that other parts of the state could use to create their own BOCES, Sousa said. While a state task force is trying to draw new school district boundaries, superintendents and school boards are enacting reforms of their own.

“We want a working model of what a BOCES is in Vermont, and we want to move that to other parts of Vermont,” Sousa said.
There are currently no BOCES in Vermont, but several supervisory unions have met with state Agency of Education officials to discuss what a BOCES might look like, Toren Ballard, a spokesperson for the agency, said in an email.
So far, Mountain Views’ collaboration with other districts has taken the form of improving services for students with special needs and providing professional development for educators, Sousa said. That effort has had the effect of reducing the number of costly out-of-district placements. Special education is a challenge for public schools, which are required by federal law to provide services, but are only partially reimbursed for them with federal money.
With the help of the collaborative, Mountain Views created a program for students at risk of not completing their schooling.
The district has special education programs at every grade level that are supported by the collaborative’s expertise and training, Sousa said.
As a result, the district has relatively few out of district placements, which saves money and also better serves students, she said.
“The collaborative is critical to making that happen,” Sousa said.
Sousa has seen dramatic changes in a 30-year career in special education. New teachers now come out of undergraduate and graduate programs with far less training in special education, she said. That puts the burden on either school districts or the state to provide professional development. The state does much less of that than it used to, she noted.
The hope is that a BOCES can fill that void. Many states enable such structures, which also are called education service agencies, education service districts, education collaboratives or regional education service agencies.
Such collaboration is not particularly new, either.
Hartford School District for many years ran the Hartford Collaborative, and still operates the Hartford Regional Resource Center, for students with developmental delays and multiple disabilities, and HARP, the Hartford Autism Regional Program.
But financial pressures, as Vermont’s student population has declined and need for student services has risen, have led local school officials to seek new ways to deliver common services at lower costs. The threat of a major restructuring of education also has served as a call to action at the local level, Sousa said.
In introducing the BOCES bill, H.630, in 2023, state Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, testified that BOCES can be used for a wide range of initiatives, from operating alternative schools to improving curriculum, standards and assessment to collective bargaining and negotiating transportation and food service contracts.
“You can’t build and maintain the expertise that you need in individual schools,” Holcombe said in an interview. It can be done at the regional level instead.
Holcombe, who served as Vermont Education secretary from 2014 to 2018, also sits on the task force that’s supposed to draw a new school district map by December. BOCES and other regional reforms hold greater promise for improving teaching and learning and saving money, she said.
If a collaborative can help teachers improve learning in the early grades, then students won’t need as much costly intervention later on, she said.
The Legislature approved the BOCES bill in 2024, and Gov. Phil Scott let it become law without his signature. At the time, all of the talk in education was about a substantial increase in property taxes and the BOCES bill received virtually no public notice. Holcombe said she’s glad to see it bearing fruit.
“I think you really have to give these districts credit for putting this idea together,” she said.
The southeastern Vermont BOCES covers Windsor County from Woodstock south, and all of Windham County and comprises at least 8,000 students.
In addition to Mountain Views, Windsor Southeast Supervisory Union, which comprises Hartland, Windsor, West Windsor and Weathersfield, is also part of the collaborative. Its board is slated to discuss and vote on joining the BOCES on Sept. 22, Superintendent Christine Bourne said.
The collaborative, which has had a director for the past three years, has provided assistance with recruiting and hiring special education staff and with professional development around such subjects as hazing, harassment and bullying and special education law, Bourne said.
“That’s been really beneficial, and provided at a reasonable cost, so staff that want to participate can participate,” Bourne said of the professional development.
“In the future, I think we’ll be able to pool resources,” she said, which could include a program for special education students who need a new placement. “We’re still in development, but the possibility for a lot of cost savings is there,” as well as additional collaborative services.
Asked to quantify how the BOCES has saved money for her district, Sousa could not provide figures, but noted that every student who stays in the district instead of being placed in an expensive program outside the public system is a major cost savings.
“We talk about restructuring education in Vermont,” she said. “This is a real opportunity.”

Declan O’Scanlon is among the Republicans who say the proposed labor rules would ""wreak havoc on independent contractors."" (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Three Republican lawmakers are seeking to overturn pending regulations regarding independent contractors that have been criticized by business groups, gig workers, and freelancers.
The concurrent resolution proposed by Sen. Declan O’Scanlon, Assemblywoman Vicky Flynn, and Assemblyman Gerry Scharfenberger — all Monmouth County Republicans — would invoke a state constitutional provision requiring regulators to amend or withdraw rules proposals that lawmakers say are out of step with their intent.
“These proposed rules by the DOL directly contradict the Legislature’s intent and would wreak havoc on independent contractors who rely on flexibility and autonomy to make a living,” O’Scanlon said in a statement. “We’re not going to sit back and let unelected bureaucrats and Trenton Democrats make life more expensive and more complicated for thousands of hardworking people.”
The Department of Labor is considering regulations that would codify its implementation of the ABC test, a three-part assessment used to determine whether workers are employees entitled to certain payroll tax benefits or independent contractors who do not fund those benefits and are mostly ineligible to receive them. The proposal has received criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
“These rules are a direct attack on worker freedom and the ability of New Jerseyans to control their own livelihoods,” Flynn said. “For many independent contractors — especially parents, caregivers, and those juggling multiple jobs — this flexibility isn’t a luxury, it’s a lifeline.
The ABC test’s three prongs measure whether a worker is free from their employers’ control, whether the work they do is outside an employer’s regular course or place of business, and whether the worker is independently engaged in business or trade.
Workers who pass all three prongs are independent contractors, and those who fail any are classed as employees.
State labor officials say the regulations would merely codify practices stemming from statute and case law that labor commissioners have employed for years.
The proposed regulations would add a list of factors courts have considered in employee misclassification cases — like whether an individual is required to work set hours, use specific tools, or wear a particular uniform — to the test’s first prong.
They would also add examples to the test’s second prong that would make clear ride share and truck drivers are employees by designating the vehicles they drive as their employers’ regular place of business.
Critics say they worry the lists’ non-exhaustive nature — meaning officials can consider factors not listed there — would create uncertainty.
Though ride-share companies like Uber and Lyft maintain they only provide platforms to connect passengers to drivers and that their drivers are independent contractors, the state treats them as employees by allowing them to file for unemployment, family leave, and temporary disability benefits, though program rules mean it’s somewhat uncommon for them to receive those benefits.
Ride-share companies do not make payments for those benefits on behalf of their drivers, so any payroll benefits those drivers receive are underwritten by other New Jersey workers and employers.
The New Jersey Supreme Court in a 2022 decision suggested the state issue regulations clarifying how it applies the test’s second prong.

As he spoke, Norman glanced at the media panel, including David Clarey of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Jessica McBride of Wisconsin Right Now and Jenna Rae of TMJ4 News. 
As Norman predicted, the panelists proceeded to keep him on the defensive throughout the contentious luncheon. Before he was peppered with questions about safety in downtown Milwaukee, police surveillance and whether officers should return to what courts have ruled were racially discriminatory and unconstitutional stop and frisk practices, Norman presented his own perspective on public safety in Wisconsin’s largest city. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“I always like to start off by saying that I am proud to be the leader of the Milwaukee Police Department,” said Norman, thanking the men and women of MPD “who protect our city through challenging times, through good times, 365 days a year, seven days a week — holidays included.” Norman also thanked the community for supporting MPD after the killing of Officer Kendall Corder, who was shot while responding to a call about a subject with a gun. 
Corner was one of at least two officers who have been shot this year. Norman said of the killings that it’s important for MPD officers to feel that “even though we have challenging times, we know that we have a community that’s behind us, and who understands the challenges that we’re going through, in regards to the work of public safety in our community.”
Tremaine Jones (who has pleaded not guilty) was arrested for the slaying with MPD compiling witness statements, and locating a backpack on-scene containing Jones’ social security card, employee I.D., birth certificate, debit cards, and a receipt for the lower receiver of the gun police say was used in the shooting. Since 2018, there have been six MPD officers killed in the line of duty. 
As Norman moved on to the latest crime statistics, he cautioned that “the numbers are numbers, they’re data sets, but they’re not the reality of what you feel from a personal feeling, your perspective…Never will I ever say that what you feel is not your reality, or the truth. And we have to work to continue to address those concerns.”
Citing the MPD’s mid-year crime statistics report, Norman told the audience at Milwaukee’s Newsroom Pub that there has been: 

A 17% violent crime reduction
7% property crime reduction
11% reduction overall for serious crimes


“And let me put that in the proper context,” Norman said, “this is on top of reductions in 2024.” According to MPD’s crime statistics dashboard, since this time last year Milwaukee has seen an 18% decline in non-fatal shootings, a 44% decline in car jackings, a 24% decline in robberies, and another 21% decline in aggravated assaults. “Now, the elephant in the room, yes homicides are up,” said Norman. In 2024, there were 132 people who lost their lives to homicide incidents in Milwaukee. A little over half way through 2025, there have been 93 deaths.
 










I do know that we’re not going to be able to arrest our way out of this.


– Jeffrey Norman, Chief of the Milwaukee Police Department


 
At the time of the mid-year report, homicides were up 13%, though the most recent numbers on the online dashboard show a 9% increase. “I always say this, anything [more] than zero is unacceptable,” said Norman. The dashboard also shows a 32% increase in human trafficking since last year, and a 52% increase since 2023. Norman didn’t address this increase, and the panelists and audience members didn’t ask about it.
Norman focused on the homicide increase, highlighting what he called “the undercurrent of what these homicides are about” — inter-personal conflict and violence that escalates into harm or death. “Poor conflict resolution,” he said, “availability of firearms to our youth. These are things that we can work together to impact, to intervene, to intercede.”

While MPD is adept at finding high-level offenders in the community, with the department boasting a nearly 80% clearance rate for solving homicides, Norman emphasized that “it’s not enough to have somebody in custody for such a horrible crime. It’s more important to prevent it.” Collaboration has been a key asset for MPD including working with community groups, elected officials and partnerships with other law enforcement agencies including the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office and State Patrol. “When we work together we are better, together, said Norman. “Leaning into the collaboration, leaning into the partnerships truly is where the rubber meets the road, so that we’re able to address when we have a flare-up of crime on Hampton Avenue, or during Cinco de Mayo, or during Juneteenth, or during Water Street, or during the Puerto Rican Fest.” Although Norman said that his own legacy has never motivated his service, he hopes to be remembered as a chief who was there, and who cared, he said, when the Milwaukee Bucks celebrated winning the NBA championship, during the  COVID-19 pandemic, the Republican National Convention and the historic floods just days ago. “He was there,” Norman said of himself. “He cared.” 
A grilling by the media panel 
The first media panel question came from Clarey of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about MPD’s use of surveillance technology. The department’s use of facial recognition software, drones and other technologies have raised concerns about privacy and due process. 
Norman said that some public safety investigations and interventions have been “wrapped up in a more quick and efficient manner by utilizing the technology.” He mentioned Flock cameras the department uses to monitor license plates and identify vehicles taken in car jackings. He also noted facial recognition technology used in repeat sexual assault and homicide cases. “These are what is going on with this particular technology,” said Norman. “I am very sensitive to the concerns about surveillance, abuse, but I say this, as any tool that can be utilized by law enforcement, has the ability to be abused. It’s about what are the bumper rails? What are the expectations? What is the oversight?” 
Norman said his department is committed to oversight and dialogue with the community about the technology. Yet, he also feels that the fears that he’s heard about surveillance technology are often “speculative.” By contrast, the chief said he could describe numerous concrete examples of carjacking suspects and people who committed violent crimes who were apprehended because of the technology. “That is what is going on,” said Norman, “and if there’s any tools that the Milwaukee Police Department can utilize to ensure that there is direct, serious and quick accountability, we shall use it.”

McBride, a journalism lecturer at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and contributor to the right-wing website Wisconsin Right Now, asked if Norman would support calling on the city to end its obligations under the Collins settlement, the result of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, which found that MPD had utilized racially motivated and unconstitutional stop and frisk practices for decades. 
McBride said that she’s heard from officers who feel that the agreement, which mandated changes to MPD’s practices, has made it “difficult if not impossible” to do “proactive policing.” McBride cited a decline in “field interviews,” or officers talking to and gathering information from people, as well as traffic stops. She connected those changes to the rise of reckless driving in Milwaukee. Norman said that officials have focused on checks and balances to ensure that MPD is compliant, but that he also agrees that the Collins settlement should be “heavily modified.” 
The agreement carries “a number of administrative burdens,” Norman said, stressing that he wholly supports constitutional policing. “There is really no wiggle room,” said Norman. “At the end of a shift, reports need to be filed. Some of our officers have done two shifts. They’re tired…There’s a cost associated with this, that’s overtime being used.” Norman said that MPD no longer sees the sort of constitutional violations which led to the Collins settlement, and that the department has shown itself to be responsible, and that things will never “backslide” on his watch.
Rae of TMJ4 asked about an incident involving a car that crashed through a police barrier in downtown Milwaukee, severely injuring two women who were crossing the street. She pushed Norman to explain why “no detectives interviewed the victims or any of the bystanders to follow up on the investigation after that crash?”

Norman said that the investigation went as far as it needed to go, and that it culminated in “accountability measures,” which included issuing citations. Rae, unsatisfied, pushed back saying Norman didn’t answer her question, but the chief reiterated that officers were on scene, interviews were done, and that nothing more was required. An awkward silence followed as the microphone passed back to Clarey, who asked about Norman’s support of city ordinances related to so-called “street takeovers”, where people noisily gather in intersections and do tricks with their cars. Later, Rae pressed Norman further on the car crash. He said he was unprepared to focus on the specific details she wanted him to discuss.
McBride asked Norman about his $65,000 raise, bringing his salary to $243,000, and added that MPD officers have gone without a raise for over two years. She asked Norman why he accepted the raise, whether he’d suspend his raise until other MPD officers receive one, and whether he supports officers getting back-pay from the city. Norman said that he earned his raise not only through his credentials, which include a law degree, but also through the amount of hours he puts in as chief.
“I sometimes work maybe 12-14 hours, work Saturdays and Sundays, I’m actually really never off,” said Norman. “It is important to understand that no one has given me anything for free, the work that I do is earned.” In 2022, CBS58 reported that over a dozen officers made more money than the chief due to overtime pay. 
Norman said he supports contract negotiations that could include back pay for officers, and that the process is in the hands of the Milwaukee Police Association and the mayor. McBride pressed again about how his raise hurts officer morale and whether he supports officers getting back pay.

Norman was also asked about officers being sent away from their own districts to work downtown and whether “broken windows” policing — a strategy that favors tight control of even small infractions to create an overall climate of safety — should be brought back. McBride suggested he did not have “an articulable policing strategy.” 
Norman was asked how he defines reckless driving; how a driver could crash into people after driving through a police barrier and “not see a day in court”; why reckless drivers without insurance retain their vehicles; how MPD retains recruits; whether prosecutors and judges should mete out tougher charges and penalties; how the Black Lives Matter protests and media reporting of policing hurts the profession and how MPD has achieved declines in carjackings. He expressed disappointment that reporters were focusing on certain incidents rather than others — including a deceased 13-year-old who wasn’t claimed for over a week, another 13-year-old who shot and killed people with an extended magazine firearm and crime on the South Side. Norman said in those cases “I wish you had the type of reporting as you have right now.”
Norman responded to a question from Wisconsin Examiner about inter-personal violence in the community and whether arresting more people and bringing more serious charges is the most effective strategy. 
“When you’re talking about inter-personal conflict, how or why does it rise [to] a level of firearm violence is perplexing,” he said. “The other day we had a situation where a person was inappropriately touched. She sees the individual who inappropriately touched her, wants to confront that person, and [in] that particular confrontation someone dies, because a firearm was used.” It would have been better to call the police than to try to resolve things with a firearm, he said.

Therapists and social scientists might have better answers to questions about violent behavior, he said. But, he added, he is committed to strengthening community partnerships with public health and safety teams, mental health specialists and other non-law-enforcement experts to try to resolve conflicts before they become violent. Many situations that escalate into homicides and firearm violence are “emotional,” he said. MPD embraces violence intervention and encourages people to be more introspective instead of  “going zero to 90.” 
“I do know that we’re not going to be able to arrest our way out of this,” Norman said of social conflict that can turn violent. Solving Milwaukee’s homicide cases is important but, he said, the community should ask, “How do we prevent it from happening, to where we don’t even have those numbers? That’s the real question.”

The Wyoming Freedom Caucus began criticizing the court’s judiciary after rulings against its initiatives. A narrow vote Tuesday indicated debate is likely to continue. 
The post Wyoming Senate panel rebuffs effort to give lawmakers more control over judicial nominations appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—A legislative committee narrowly rejected a proposal Tuesday to involve the state Senate in the selection of Wyoming Supreme Court justices, though some conservative lawmakers are likely to continue scrutinizing the state’s judiciary.
The decision comes amid rising criticism from Republicans of judicial rulings both nationally and in Wyoming, where judges have struck down abortion restrictions and put on hold an expansive school voucher program.
The Joint Judiciary Committee had in May voted to consider a constitutional amendment that — if approved by voters in a statewide election — would require Senate approval of new appointees to Wyoming’s high court. Though lawmakers backing the bill cast it as a restrained step toward holding judges more accountable to the public, opponents said it was a sea change that would have injected partisan politics into the judicial nominating process — and courtrooms themselves. 
On Tuesday, a 6-3 majority of House members of the Joint Judiciary Committee voted to advance the bill to the 2026 legislative session. Senators, however, voted 3-2 against the constitutional amendment. A majority of committee members from both the House and Senate must vote in favor of a bill for the committee to officially sponsor it. 
Lawmakers can still introduce the bill in the coming session, but it will not have the imprimatur of the judiciary committee. 
Wyoming jurists mounted a spirited opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment during sometimes tense public comments to lawmakers at the committee meeting. Personal injury lawyers spoke against the bill, as did the attorneys who defend companies and government entities against them. Both groups argued that Wyoming is one of the best states in the country at picking qualified, politically impartial judges, and they asked lawmakers not to thrust themselves into the process.
“Our system isn’t broken, please don’t become the type of activist legislature that is looking for solutions to problems that don’t exist,” Alaina Stedillie, president of the Defense Lawyers Association of Wyoming, said. 
But lawmakers, particularly in the House, said they were hearing concerns from their constituents. “We need to determine if it’s just a noisy minority or if this is really a groundswell,” Rep. Tom Kelly, R-Sheridan, said. “The only way to do that is to send it to the people and have them tell us.”
Among the no votes on the Senate were the committee’s two practicing attorneys, Sens. Barry Crago, R-Buffalo, and Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne. Rep. Ken Chestek, a law professor and Laramie Democrat, also voted against the bill.

The Wyoming Freedom Caucus began to publicly criticize the state’s judiciary this spring, following the lead of President Donald Trump, who has blasted federal judges who ruled against him and called for their impeachment. Caucus representatives have pointed to state judges’ rulings on abortion rights and public education funding that they disagree with as evidence that the judiciary is overstepping its bounds and is out of touch with Wyoming. 
“A lack of public buy-in to the judicial selection process has left Wyomingites feeling confused, upset, and blindsided by the decisions reached by many on the bench,” the caucus wrote in a set of blog posts.
Attorneys who testified on Tuesday rejected that assertion. “Where is this coming from?” Stedillie asked the committee. “I don’t believe that there has been any great clamor by the citizenry of this state to say our judicial branch is broken.”
Debate over the judicial nominating process has carried forward through a summer in which many Wyomingites have anxiously awaited a ruling from the Wyoming Supreme Court on whether a complete ban on abortion, brought by the Freedom Caucus, runs counter to the state’s constitution. That ruling is expected at any time.

The most recent available polling by the Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center on the question suggests more residents approve of how the state’s judges handle their jobs than disapprove. In polling conducted last September and October, only 13% of respondents told the center they disapproved of how judges handle their jobs, while more than 40% of respondents said they approved. 
Wyoming today operates under what is commonly called the Missouri Plan, where a commission reviews applicants and sends three choices to the governor for a final pick. 
The Wyoming Judicial Nominating Commission is composed of six people. Three lawyers are elected by members of the Wyoming State Bar, and three non-lawyers are appointed by the governor. The seventh member, who serves as chairperson and tie breaker, is the chief justice of the Wyoming Supreme Court — a post now held by Lynne Boomgarden. 
The three finalists are named, and the governor traditionally waits 30 days before making a final selection, which gives the public a chance to weigh in. Freedom Caucus lawmakers and other conservatives have availed themselves of that window to pressure the governor away from certain nominees in the past. 
Citing those unfavored nominees, the Freedom Caucus has labeled both the judicial nominating commission and the Wyoming Bar Association as “a victim of left-wing institutional capture.” 
Caucus lawmakers have raised different proposals to fix that alleged bias. They’ve ranged from the drastic — changing the state constitution so that Wyoming voters directly elect judges — to the incremental — pushing the judiciary to make public the names of all applicants for judgeships, not just the three finalists. 
Judiciary representatives, including the recently retired state Supreme Court Justice Kate Fox, have indicated they’d consider publicizing those names. Some of the attorneys who testified at Tuesday’s meeting, however, said doing so would diminish both the quantity and quality of applicants. The state’s best lawyers will be reluctant to apply for a competitive judgeship if they know their law firm colleagues, or their clients, will learn they’re considering a career change, those attorneys said. 
Lawmakers did not make any proposal to publicize all applicants’ names, which the judiciary could do itself through rule making.

Humans have responded to AI, like many innovations, with skepticism, but could it govern better than politicians? The bar is pretty low, columnist Rod Miller writes.
The post Politics is the ultimate test for artificial intelligence. appeared first on WyoFile .","Like it or not, artificial intelligence is rapidly weaving itself into the fabric of our everyday lives. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is an invisible hand that moves levers and flips switches without our conscious knowledge that it is at work. And this fact scares hell out of a lot of folks. 

Opinion

Innovations have always scared hell out of a lot of folks. Every human advancement has been met with skepticism and fear when first introduced. That’s just how our minds work. This is likely a holdover reflex from the time when we were a prey species and everything really was trying to kill us.
From fire, stone tools and the wheel, through steam engines, automobiles and computers, there has always been an appreciable segment of our population that has freaked out and said, “We’re all gonna die!” 
Yet, here we still are. And each innovation has advanced human civilization to the point that we now take them for granted.
Today, AI is taking its rightful place in the pantheon of advancements that scare hell out of us. Even though we all unconsciously use AI every day, and some are thriving with this new intelligence, others firmly believe that it portends the end of the human race.
We fear AI, like we feared horseless carriages, because we don’t understand it. We fear it because it’s new, and we’re more comfortable with old stuff. We fear AI because we think it will replace us rather than usher us into the future. 
We are afraid of AI because we think it is some alien force that has invaded our world, when AI is really just the product of the human mind exponentially multiplied. We’re nervous that it might change our world, and change is always scary for humans.
The reality is that AI is already helping us behind the scenes in many walks of life. Doctors use the power of AI in diagnosing and treating what ails us. Lawyers use AI to do legal research that keeps us out of the hoosegow. Every time you Google a question, you get an answer influenced by AI. And the list goes on.
AI is apolitical and nonpartisan; it would never be a slave to Democrat or Republican dogma. rod miller
Artificial Intelligence can read, understand, analyze and remember everything written in any language on Earth, expressed in both words and numbers, and do so in less time than it takes you to read this column. AI is a tool like any other, and we can learn to use it to our advantage.
Now, I’ll use the rest of my space here to suggest a role for AI in our lives that should dramatically ratchet up the pucker factor among readers. Politics and governance in human societies might be the highest and best use for AI.
Hear me out.
Read any survey or poll about trustworthiness among professions in America, and you’ll find that politicians are ranked well below pimps and horse thieves. Used car salesmen score higher than politicians. With that in mind, why do we trust politicians with the solemn chore of governing us?
An open-source, transparent and fully auditable AI model would do a better job at this. It would never lie to us or steal from us. AI can dispassionately carry out our instructions.
For instance, we could instruct it to “form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,” and AI would do it in a heartbeat with no backsass. God knows the politicians we’ve elected to do precisely that have done a piss poor job of it!
AI is pure logic and wouldn’t exhibit the human emotional frailties of anger, greed, vanity, hate or the other impediments to good government that we now tolerate from politicians. AI would never suffer cognitive decline. Since it lacks gonads, AI would never screw an intern or rack up frequent flier miles on the Lolita Express. It would never prostitute itself for money or headlines.
AI is apolitical and nonpartisan; it would never be a slave to Democrat or Republican dogma. 
How many politicians can you say that about?
Throughout our shared history, we humans have always had options when faced with an innovation, and our common story is about how we have made choices at those times. We embraced fire because we chose not to keep eating raw meat. We chose the wheel because we got tired of carrying heavy stuff on our backs.
We can choose to keep electing flawed politicians with their appalling track record, or we can choose an alternate option that scares hell out of us but might do a much better job. 
This will be interesting.

The Idaho Legislature’s interim Land Use and Housing Study Committee meets at 8 a.m. Thursday in Sandpoint.
Thursday’s meeting is the committee’s third since Sen. Ali Rabe, D-Boise, pushed for creation of the committee during the 2025 legislative session. In calling for the committee, Rabe said access to affordable housing is one of the most important issues facing Idaho. 
After years working on housing issues as executive director of the Boise-based nonprofit organization Jesse Tree, Rabe said the committee represents an important step of bringing state legislators, city officials, builders, planners, building officials, real estate agents and more to the same table together.
“It was an important step because the problem in the past was people would bring forward legislative proposals in January and no one was on the same page so nothing ever got done,” Rabe said. “I think it’s really important to hear from all the stakeholders.” 
Now, Rabe said legislators, building officials, planners, homebuilders and other folks are all having a comprehensive conversation around housing.
 Idaho legislators will start considering recommendations to address affordable housing in the state

Through the first two meetings, the committee has been in information gathering mode, said Sen. Jim Woodward, a Republican from Sagle who serves as the committee’s co-chair.

After Thursday’s meeting, Woodward said committee members will have a homework assignment to begin considering recommendations.
Woodward hopes to compile recommendations, not new laws, in a best practices document because the solution to housing needs may look different in small, rural or tourist communities than it will in larger cities.
“I will be slow in moving to a state-level solution because I think we can take on most of these challenges at the local level,” Woodward said Tuesday. “When we put in place a law, that always becomes a one-size-fits-all solution.”
Throughout the process, Woodward said he has been struck by how interested the public is in the committee and land use and housing issues. Woodward also said one issue with housing is undeniable – many people in Idaho are not able to afford to continue living in the place where they grew up. 
Rabe said there will be some tension as the committee moves from information gathering to decision making or taking action.
But she remains optimistic. 
“No matter their political background, folks agree this is a big issue right now that needs to be addressed,” Rabe said
Through the first two meetings, Rabe said the committee has centered around a few key issues. Rabe said one major issue is infrastructure needs like water and sewer systems. Rabe said the Idaho Legislature’s passage of the property tax bill House Bill 389 during the 2021 legislative session limits growth of local budgets and hurts cities’ and counties’ ability to afford infrastructure needed to support housing development.
“It’s one of the issues preventing housing from getting built in Idaho,” Rabe said. “We’ve talked about infrastructure quite a bit, and we will keep talking about it.”
Rabe said committee members have also discussed financing options, tax credits or subsidies for builders and other incentives as possible creative solutions to building more housing.
After this week’s meeting, the Land Use and Housing Study Committee is scheduled to meet again Sept. 26 at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

OTTAWA COUNTY — “We are standing here today to stand up to the Trump Administration to tell them, ‘Get this coal plant shut down.'”


That was the message that lawmakers, health professionals and other officials said at a Tuesday, Aug. 12, press conference near the J.H. Campbell coal plant in West Michigan’s Ottawa County, which has become the epicenter of a legal battle between the U.S. Department of Energy and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.
The group believes the Trump Administration created an “energy emergency” to justify issuing an emergency order May 23 mandating that Consumers Energy keep the plant open at least 90 days, which superseded the utility’s closure plan slated for May 31, along with the approval of closure by state regulators.
“We’re here today because in 2024 Donald Trump made a deal with the fossil fuel industry: ‘You give me a billion dollars to prop up my campaign, and I will prop up your industry,'” said state Rep. Stephen Wooden, D-81, whose district includes the northeast portion of Grand Rapids.
“And that’s why coal plants that were scheduled to close have been forced to stay open, costing Michigan rate payers a million dollars a day, at a time when we are still dealing with a cost-of-living crisis, when a trade war is costing the average Michigan family $2,500 a year,” he said.
“We are standing here today to stand up to the Trump Administration to tell them, ‘Get this coal plant shut down, to re-shut it down, to listen to local folks, to listen to Michiganders, to listen to the utilities that have already scheduled this closure, instead of propping up a coal plant that doesn’t need to stay open.”

 How we got here

The Campbell Plant is Consumers’ last — and largest — coal-fired plant in Michigan.
The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.
Consumers has said closing the plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040.
The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.
Since the announcement, Consumers has been actively preparing the plant for “full retirement,” a spokesperson said last year.
“The complex will officially go into retirement with an aim to go cold and dark after 2025,” said former Consumers spokesperson Kristen Van Kley. “In 2026 and on, the complex will be demolished with a plan to restore the site over time.”
The plant, when operating at full capacity, can generate 1,450 megawatts of electricity. Michigan consumed about 113,740 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy.
At the time, Van Kley said new technologies would ensure Consumers would be able to continue supporting the statewide grid.
“Energy efficiency, demand response and emerging technologies such as grid modernization and battery storage will help us lower peak customer demand for electricity and deliver exactly what Michigan needs,” she said. “Our plan is designed to respond to emerging needs, adapt to changing conditions and embrace emerging innovative technologies as we work to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.”
On May 23, Secretary Wright directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator in coordination with Consumers, to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a prepared news release.
The Energy Department said the emergency order, which is issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”
“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”
In June, Nessel — along with a collective group of public interest organizations, Minnesota and Illinois, Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, and the Organization of Midcontinent Independent System Operator States — challenged the DOE’s order to keep the Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township to remain open for 90 days, arguing that the move will force customers to absorb exorbitant costs.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the emergency order demanding that the plant “remain available for operation” on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.
The U.S. Department of Energy said the move was intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”
Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order seeking to stop the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”
She said the order “will burden Michigan utility customers with unnecessary costs and needless additional pollution from the 60-year-old Ottawa County coal plant that was scheduled to close May 31.”
A request for rehearing is a legal process where a party asks a court to reconsider a decision it has already made. It’s typically used when a party believes the court made a mistake in its initial ruling, whether by overlooking a crucial fact, misinterpreting the law, or making some other error.
When the DOE didn’t respond to Nessel’s request within 21 days, she filed a petition for review July 24 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C., Circuit, challenging the U.S. Department of Energy’s order, claiming the “arbitrary and illegal” move forced the continued operation of the plant “under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”

“This unprecedented order by the Department of Energy declares an emergency without evidence, completely ignores state and federal regulators that approved the plant’s retirement, and will potentially put enormous costs onto utility customers who receive no real benefit,” Nessel said. “I will continue to fight to protect Michigan customers from unreasonable costs imposed by the federal government.”
Last month, Nessel also filed a pleading before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to Consumers’ request to recover the costs from running the Campbell plant beyond its initial retirement date. That proceeding is still ongoing.
Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers, said Tuesday that the utility is continuing to comply with the DOE order and has requested “the timely recovery of costs associated with plant operations.”
“We expect FERC will take timely action on our request. Our FERC filing from Friday, June 6, requests approval of a mechanism to recover and allocate those costs through MISO.
 What’s happening now

Tuesday’s event saw environmental activists, health experts and politicians calling on the closure of the Campbell plant — whether that be the DOE not renewing the emergency order or reversing it before it expires on Aug. 20.
Jayce Bylenga, West Michigan regional coordinator for Michigan League of Conservation Voters, read a prepared statement from Nessel at Tuesday’s event, which Bylenga’s group helped organize, along with the Sierra Club.
“My department signed a settlement with Consumers in 2021 that included the retirement of the Campbell coal plant and made all due preparations to maintain our state’s energy load without it. Our plan, were it not curtailed by the baseless actions of the Trump Administration, just eight days before it would have gone into effect — was set to save Michigan customers nearly $600 million never before is the Department of Energy delayed the retirement of a power plant absent a request from the operating utility or local government body,” Nessel said in the statement.
Nessel said the majority of Michigan residents don’t want to see rate hikes passed along to them and the continuation of burning fossil fuels.

“To put it plainly, no one asked for this,” Nessel said. “The unprecedented order of the department of the DOE fabricates an emergency without evidence, completely ignores the state and federal regulators that approve the plans retirement and will potentially put enormous costs onto Michigan utility customers who receive no real benefit, and that’s before taking into account the environmental and public health health costs of continuing to fuel a full-powered plan.
“Michigan must be present in the fight to maintain self-determination over where our power comes from. The DOE ignored my request for rehearing, and as a result, I have filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overturn this expensive and unlawful order. As I’ve done throughout my years in office, my department will continue to fight for affordable utility bills on the rights of Michiganders to clean up their energy production.”
Dr. Steven Ashmead, a family physician and a member of the Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action, said coal-fired plants pose serious negative health effects to residents, which is part of well-settled science.

“Medical science has had over 250 years to study the health impacts of using coal for heat and energy production. The health effects have been documented at every stage of coal production and combustion, from mining to the disposal of ash,” Ashmead said. “These pollutants directly affect our hearts, blood vessels, lungs and brains. Children, the elderly like myself, pregnant women and individuals with chronic disease and those that work outdoors are at increased risk of exposure to these deadly pollutants. … That does not include the millions of dollars that will be spent on health problems associated with burning of coal, such as asthma, COPD, heart attacks, stroke, cancer and many other chronic diseases.”
 What’s the cost to keep Campbell open?

Nessel said Wright’s order would lead to Michiganders “feeling a pinch in their pockets.”
“The costs of maintaining production at the plant, long since prepared for closure, could be an enormous burden on the rate-paying customers of Consumers Energy,” she said. “And that’s before taking into account the environmental and public health costs of continuing to fuel a coal-powered plant.”
In a June 3 statement, a Consumers spokesperson said the company is currently complying with the order.
“We are currently in compliance with the order, have arranged for new shipments of coal, some of which arrived last week, and will continuously operate the Campbell Plant,” Trisha Bloembergen, West Michigan media relations specialist, said in a June 3 email. “We are still determining the overall cost, but want to ensure those costs are shared across MISO and not all on Consumers Energy customers.”
Generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers, experts from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote June 5.
Campbell Units 1 and 2, which are 63 and 58 years old, respectively, were already increasingly uncompetitive in the MISO market, meaning it cost more to generate electricity than what it could be sold for, said energy data analysts Seth Feaster and Dennis Wamsted.
According to data filed by Consumers at FERC, the operation and maintenance costs for the two units totaled $45.80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2023 (the most recent data available). That puts both units in the red almost all the time in MISO: S&P data shows that the monthly around-the-clock price at the Michigan hub has been above $40/MWh just twice in the past two years, and never during the summer.
“In other words, the plant would lose money on virtually every MWh generated if past prices hold this summer, costs that could add up to many more millions of dollars if the units at Campbell are run for any substantial amount of time,” Feaster and Wamsted said.
Beyond operational costs, there are fuel and staffing costs as well.
“Coal itself has gotten more expensive,” said Frank Rambo, executive director at Horizon Climate Initiative, a nonprofit organization that works to use cost-saving energy market reforms to address the causes and impacts of climate change.
“That fleet has gotten more expensive to run. It’s coal, which used to be synonymous with cheap power. It’s now among the most expensive power … and then the excess costs that are incurred because they’re running more expensive resources.
Ultimately, it will be residents who foot the bill, Rambo said.
“They run those coal plants, and then they turn around, go to their commissions and recover those excess costs from their customers,” he said.
Rambo said the price could be even higher than normal because Consumers would need to buy coal on the open market rather than enter into a new contract with a mine.
“We don’t need to sign a new long-term coal supply contract because we’re shutting the plant down,” he said. “Now they may have to buy coal on the spot market.”
The price of coal has hovered around $110 per ton on the U.S. commodities exchange. As of June 19, the price of coal was $103.85 per ton.
In 2024, Campbell burned more than 3.7 million tons of coal, Feaster and Wamsted said. That is an average of 12,700 tons of coal a day, which would amount to $1,318,895 per day using today’s prices.
According to Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, keeping this coal plant on life support even for 90 days may add upwards of $100 million in additional costs — the bulk of which will be passed on to ratepayers across the 15 states.
All of the Campbell plant’s coal was previously delivered by rail from the Powder River Basin in northern Wyoming, according to the IEFF.
Two of the PRB’s biggest mines provided that coal: Arch Resources’ Black Thunder Mine, which delivered 2.25 million tons, and Peabody Energy’s North Antelope Rochelle Mine, which delivered 1.47 million tons.
Rambo also noted the plant staffing issue, explaining that Consumers likely already had phased out several employees who were then called back.
“We were laying these people off. Now we’re going to have to hire them as contractors,” likely at a higher pay rate because the work would be temporary, Rambo explained.
“There are all sorts of excess costs that would not be incurred, but for the fact that there’s now this executive order,” he said.
Carey, of Consumers, said Tuesday that the utility’s costs will “depend on a number of factors, including offsetting revenue from plant operations, and are still being determined.”
“The cost of operating the plant will be shared by customers across the north and central MISO region, consistent with the DOE order,” she said. “We will continue to work with MISO and with federal and state regulators to ensure compliance with the order and appropriate cost recovery.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1024x918.jpg,,,2025-08-13 06:56:40.740862

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

 Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
How Congress’s megabill will impact Idaho: Cuts to taxes, Medicaid, SNAP and more

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 New law puts greater food assistance burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.












This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center




“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
On the Fourth of July, Trump signs his ‘big, beautiful bill’ into law

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Officials in the small West Tennessee town of Mason on Tuesday approved a contract with private prison corporation CoreCivic to operate the former West Tennessee Detention Facility as an immigration detention facility.
The Mason Board of Mayor and Aldermen called a special meeting to review two contracts: one between the town and CoreCivic, and one between the town and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 
After a chaotic exchange between aldermen and a crowd of constituents and residents of nearby towns in West Tennessee, the board approved the CoreCivic contract 4-1 with two abstentions. The ICE contract passed 3-2 with two abstentions.
Neither document was provided to the public prior to the meeting, and town attorney Nathan Bicks said he and others were working on the CoreCivic contract until Monday, giving the board about 24 hours to review it in its final form before the vote.
Crowds flanked the 1,500-person town’s Main Street more than 40 minutes before the meeting began, holding signs decrying ICE and opposing the facility’s reopening. 










We need everybody’s support, everybody’s business here. We open arms for everybody. We’re not against nobody.


– Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman


The 600-bed prison closed in 2021 after the Department of Justice, under order from then-President Joe Biden, did not renew its contract with CoreCivic to operate the facility. President Donald Trump reversed Biden’s order against contracting with private detention facilities in January.
Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman, the first Egyptian immigrant to represent the town, voted in favor of both contracts, citing the job and economic opportunities that would come with reopening the facility.
“We need everybody’s support, everybody’s business here,” he said. “We open arms for everybody. We’re not against nobody.”
Alderman Virginia Rivers, who previously served as the town’s vice mayor, disagreed.
“I feel you should have been notified and made aware of this situation before now,” Rivers told the audience. “I understand and support the need to deport actual criminals, but the majority of the people who are being deported and detained are lawful citizens.”
“We, as the officials of the Town of Mason that was elected by the citizens, should consider the consequences and the hurt that this will cause our local community, our neighbors, Tennessee schools, and many families,” Rivers said, adding that entering into a contract with CoreCivic and ICE would “make our city complicit in the abusive treatment of immigrants.”

Mason officials held the meeting in the Mason Fire Department garage across the street from Mason City Hall to accommodate some of the larger crowd. The remaining audience stood outside the garage doors, chanting and drumming through most of the meeting. Officials passed around a microphone attached to a karaoke machine, and audience members repeatedly yelled out that they could not hear what officials were saying.
The majority of audience members who spoke at the meeting opposed the contracts. 
Those who spoke in support pointed to property tax, impact fees and utility revenue that would come from the facility. CoreCivic stated the facility would generate about $325,000 in annual property taxes, and an estimated $1.2 million in annual utility payments. When fully operational, the facility would generate about $200,000 in annual impact fees to the town, according to the company.










I understand and support the need to deport actual criminals, but the majority of the people who are being deported and detained are lawful citizens.


– Alderman Virginia Rivers


Eloise Thompson, a fifth-generation resident of nearby Fayette County, said she was against Mason “becoming a for-profit center for human suffering.”
She said Mason has other alternatives to create jobs and stimulate the local economy that “speak more to the character of who we are.”
Darryle Donell, a veteran and Mason resident, said he previously worked at the facility when it was run by Corrections Corporation of America, which later became CoreCivic.
“That prison ain’t never been good for the town,” he said, calling for transparency, honesty and loyalty from town leaders. “I don’t see no prison. I see a concentration camp.”
Christa Poindexter, another Mason resident, approached Noeman during the meeting and asked why he supported the contracts.
“I want the job. Jobs,” he said.
At one point, at least three board members — Noeman, Vice Mayor Reynaldo Givhan, and Alderman Alethea Harris — exited the building during a period of public comment.

Givhan voted in favor of the CoreCivic contract but abstained from voting on the ICE contract.
“When I moved here 20 years ago, CCA or CoreCivic employed several of my family members, and it was thriving,” he said after the meeting adjourned. “I was actually excited when we first got word that they were coming, that it was going to reopen.”
The “negative connotation that’s connected with just the word ICE … you feel it, and in your heart of hearts, you have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror,” he said of his abstention.
Givhan said he exited the building, which was not air conditioned, during the meeting to “get some air” and pray. He said he did not talk to other board members and did not see other members talking to each other.
CoreCivic Public Affairs Manager Brian Todd said 2,100 people have already applied for the roughly 240 job openings at the facility. These roles would pay a starting salary of about $26.50 per hour, according to a statement distributed by CoreCivic representatives at the meeting.
“You all may feel that there’s no oversight and accountability at the facility, and that is far, far from the truth,” CoreCivic representative Jerry Langford said. “The facility will operate with strong oversight and accountability … our government partners will have a presence at that facility while we’re operating, including regular audits and on-site monitors. Both our company and the government partners share a deep commitment to humane care.”

Beauregard in St. Bernard Parish, pictured in July 2025. (Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator)ST. BERNARD PARISH — Before being elevated by Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, the slave-owning new namesake of the state’s largest National Guard training facility was at best a footnote in history, according to a review of what few documents are available to trace his background. 
Camp Beauregard, founded in 1917 in Pineville, was originally named after Confederate Gen. Pierre Gustav Toutant Beauregard, a St. Bernard Parish native who initiated the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, to begin the Civil War. In 2023, Beauregard’s name was removed from the facility amid a nationwide effort to remove monuments and honorifics to Confederate veterans and leaders. 
Landry announced in July the facility would be renamed after the Confederate general’s father, Jacques Toutant-Beauregard. 
The governor’s decision to restore the Beauregard name is in keeping with the style of President Donald Trump’s administration, which has restored the former Confederate names of military installations by selecting unrelated military heroes. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But Landry’s choice of honoree is different. 
For starters, Camp Beauregard’s new namesake is shown in nearly every historical document and on his grave as Jacques Toutant. According to a biography of his son, “P.G.T. Beauregard, Napoleon in Gray,” by historian T. Harry Williams, the future Confederate general began going by a single last name, Beauregard, when he enrolled at West Point in an attempt to Americanize himself. 
Jacques Toutant is also different from Trump’s other restored honorees as he is related to the original namesake. He also does not have any distinctive military accomplishments and was a slave owner, which to many make him a worse choice than his son, who adopted more racially moderate stances after the war. 
“It signals to the Black citizens in [Louisiana] that [Landry] thinks you’re second-class and he doesn’t care if you’re offended,” University of North Carolina Charlotte historian Karen Cox, a scholar on the legacy of Confederate monuments, said of Landry’s decision. 
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly did not respond to a request for comment as to why the National Guard facility was being renamed, who was involved in the decision or why Landry opted to name it after a slave owner. 
Little is known about Jacques Toutant other than that he owned a sugarcane plantation in St. Bernard Parish that was later named Contreras. Enslaved people were forced to work on his fields and in his home. Toutant also served as a captain in the Louisiana Militia, though historical records don’t tie him to any particular battle. 
Six historians at four universities contacted for this report declined to comment on his history, citing how little they as individuals – and historians as a group – know about the elder Beauregard. 
“Very little has been written on Contreras Plantation or on Jacques Beauregard, apart from brief mentions in biographies of P.G.T Beauregard,” LSU historian John Bardes said. 
The most detailed records of Toutant’s life come in the Slave Schedules of the 1850 census, which list the age, residence and owner of each enslaved person in the United States. 
Toutant is listed as the owner of 86 enslaved people, ranging from a 60-year-old Black woman to a 2-year-old mixed-race child. The names of the enslaved people Toutant owned were never recorded. 
According to P.G.T. Beauregard’s biographer, T. Harry Williams, Toutant forced an enslaved woman to nurse his children, a practice that often forcefully separated Black women from their own infants. 
Even on his home turf in St. Bernard Parish, the name Jacques Toutant is all but forgotten. 
The site of the Contreras Plantation, where a large home burned down in the mid-20th century, is marked with a decrepit memorial to P.G.T. Beauregard. Enclosed on three sides by barbed-wire topped fences, the grassy patches that surround the memorial were littered with empty beer cans and rotted picnic tables when visited by a reporter in late July. 
The white brick pyramid memorial at the Contreras site was financed by Judge Leander Perez, according to local historian and author Sean Michael Chick. Perez is remembered as a dogged segregationist who was excommunicated from the Catholic Church for his efforts to obstruct the integration of schools in New Orleans. He also attempted to stop civil rights workers from entering Plaquemines Parish to help Black residents register to vote. 
Once pristine, the pyramid was covered in grayish muck during a reporter’s recent visit. It only mentions Toutant as among the general’s ancestors. 
Less than 2 miles down the road, Toutant is buried in the St. Bernard Parish Catholic Cemetery. The engraved door to his tomb is broken in over a dozen places, his name hardly legible through the cracks and the wear of time.

The grave also bears a medallion commemorating Toutant as a veteran of the War of 1812. 
It is on this veteran status that Landry chose to honor Toutant. 
“By restoring the name Camp Beauregard, we honor a legacy of courage and service that dates back over two centuries,” Landry said in his announcement about the renaming. 
Through a public records request, the Illuminator obtained the historical documents the Louisiana National Guard said it used to justify renaming its Pineville training base after Toutant. They included militia payroll records that span from Dec. 16, 1814, to March 20, 1815. They indicate Toutant served under Col. Pierre Denys de la Ronde, who led the Louisiana Militia at the Battle of New Orleans and later earned the rank of major general. 
The records do not definitively place Toutant at the site of any particular battle or indicate he earned any military honors. A Louisiana National Guard press release announcing the renaming notes his regiment took part in a prelude to the Battle of New Orleans, although historians have noted only minor skirmishes along Lake Borgne before the war’s final conflict in Chalmette.  
Despite having no details on Toutant’s militia service, Maj. Gen. Thomas Friloux, adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, praised him as an American hero. 
“We’re naming our premier training installation after an American hero and patriot who fought for the freedom of the city of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana, and the United States of America against a foreign invader,” Friloux said. 
When asked about this discrepancy, Louisiana National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. Noel Collins referred questions to the Society of the War of 1812’s Louisiana chapter, which she said was consulted for information about Toutant. 
Chapter president Brig. Gen. Rodney Painting, who is listed online as an assistant adjutant general in the Louisiana National Guard, did not respond to a request for comment.

Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In total, lawmakers in 25 states, including Colorado, introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Gov. Polis vetoes 11 bills, a personal record, passed in 2025 by Colorado Legislature

Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
“Allowing (the measure) to become law would require a driver to be present in commercial vehicles, which may undermine innovation of future technologies that could increase road safety,” Polis said in his veto letter.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A pro-private school voucher group that poured millions into 2024 Tennessee House races is setting its sights on a Republican in the 7th District Congressional special election.
A dark money group called the School Freedom Fund spent almost $20,000 in early August to oppose state Rep. Jody Barrett, a Dickson Republican. Last year, the School Freedom Fund spent more than $3.1 million in state legislative races to boost candidates who backed Gov. Bill Lee’s private school voucher program. 
The spending paid off when the legislation narrowly passed the state House at the start of 2025. Barrett vocally opposed and voted against the voucher program. 
The group’s spending is expected to grow significantly after it reported in June that the political action committee had a $10 million war chest, according to the Federal Election Commission. Dark money is funding raised to influence elections, typically by nonprofits groups not required to disclose the names of donors.
“It’s not a surprise,” Barrett said in response to questions from the Lookout. “I think most people who pay attention to state-level politics knew what was coming when they saw who was entering this race to replace Mark Green.”
Tennessee’s election to fill an open seat left by Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green is set for an Oct. 7 primary, and the general election is scheduled for Dec. 2. He stepped away from the post with more than a year left in his term, creating a surge of interest in the congressional seat: 19 Republicans and five Democrats have picked up petitions to run.

Kip Capley, Gino Bulso and Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson. Reeves and Bulso are running for Congress in Tennessee’s 7th District. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
One candidate for the post, Republican state Rep. Lee Reeves of Franklin, benefited to the tune of $787,100 from independent spending by the School Freedom Fund in 2024. Reeves, who did not respond to phone calls, also received an endorsement in his 2024 campaign from Lee, an unusual move from a governor in a state race. Reeves won by less than 100 votes in the Republican primary.
Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose group controls independent spending by the School Freedom Fund, recently circulated posts on X, formerly Twitter, saying Barrett is “anti-Trump” and voted against the “school choice” bill. The voucher measure will start this year, providing $7,200 each to 20,000 Tennessee students to use for private-school attendance.
“He’s the opposite of what we need in TN-07. Kick this snake to the curb,” McIntosh’s video says.
The post also contains comments from Barrett in 2016 when he supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the presidency and called Trump “a liberal douchebag.”
Responding to that criticism, Barrett sent comments to the Lookout showing McIntosh also questioned the president by saying, “Donald Trump is the worst kind of politician – he will say anything to get elected.” It was part of a Club for Growth attack ad that circulated in 2016.
Barrett said the group is “having to dig awfully deep” if it is questioning his skepticism about Trump from nine years ago before he took office and showed the type of policies he would support.
Despite $4.5 million in spending by pro-private school voucher groups last year, support for the governor’s bill gained only a couple of votes, including those of Reeves and Rep. Aron Maberry, a Clarksville Republican. The group spent almost $1.8 million in those two races, far outpacing any other spending. 
Republican Sen. Jessie Seal also received independent backing totaling more than half a million dollars in his defeat of the late Sen. Frank Niceley, a Strawberry Plains farmer who died in June. Niceley vocally opposed vouchers. 
Seal, a Tazewell Republican, voted against the private-school voucher bill along with first-term Sens. Bobby Harshbarger of Kingsport and Tom Hatcher of Maryville.
Hashbarger defeated pro-voucher Sen. Jon Lundberg of Bristol, then voted against the bill even though his mother, U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger, is a major supporter of President Trump, who along with Lee called private-school vouchers the “civil rights issue” of this era.

Patrick Morrisey said Tuesday he’s inclined to comply with a request from President Donald Trump’s administration to supply personal data for state residents who rely on a federal food assistance program. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has asked states to turn over the information, including recipients’ names, dates of birth, personal addresses and Social Security numbers to comply with a Trump executive order called “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos.”
The request also included records to calculate the amount of SNAP benefits they got over time.
Morrisey said he needs to look further into the federal request for SNAP recipients personal data, but conceptually the state wants to help the Trump administration’s purpose.
“The goal that they have is to root out fraud, waste and abuse, and to go after undocumented aliens,” Morrisey said. “And I think that they want to look at a number of the public programs, including SNAP. I’m supportive of that. 
“Obviously you always want to protect the privacy of citizens, but there’s a real issue ensuring that we’re going to have the adequate details to go after fraud, waste and abuse, and to make sure that undocumented aliens and other people are not taking advantage of these benefits unlawfully,” he said. “So my inclination is to work closely with the Trump administration on that and make sure that we’re giving them the tools they need to limit bad use of taxpayer money.”
Morrisey’s comments came in response to a question from West Virginia Watch.
Last week, 22 organizations — including the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, the ACLU of West Virginia, Facing Hunger Foodbank and the West Virginia Food and Farm Coalition — called on Morrisey to reject with the request, calling it “an outrageous act of federal overreach” without clear parameters for how the federal government intends to use the personal data. 
A coalition of 21 states and Washington D.C. led by Democrat attorneys general in California and New York sued the federal government over privacy concerns with the data request. They asked a judge to stop the government from making the demand or stop it from withholding funding from states that don’t comply. 
In West Virginia last year, more than 277,000 people got SNAP benefits, according to the Center on Budget and Policy.

(Photo courtesy of U.S Forest Service/ InciWeb Information System)Here we are now, in the typically hot month of August in Idaho. Our rangelands and forests are extremely dry at this time of year, and ripe for burning. 
Currently Stage 1 fire restrictions are in place for state, Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service lands, but we need to double-down in our message to Idahoans about the need for everyone to be smart and do your part to prevent wildfires. 
Idaho wildfire potential remains high as hot temperatures continue 

As a rancher, mom, business woman, volunteer wildland firefighter and chair of the Idaho Rangeland Resources Commission, I’m particularly concerned about the huge potential for range fires ignited by careless people when they’re venturing outdoors.
Roughly 80 percent of the wildfires that occur in Idaho and the West are typically human-caused. It might be accidental; it might be out of neglect. But we can make a difference if we use common sense. 
I live near Grand View, and when I see a giant mushroom cloud rising above the Snake River Plains and the mountains above, I get this awful feeling in my heart about who or what might be killed or injured by that wildfire, who’s valuable range might be getting burned up, the potential loss of wildlife and livestock, native plants and shrubs, and more. 
In the Idaho Rangeland Resources Commission’s Life on the Range series, we featured a story about the human-caused Moose wildfire near Salmon in 2022. The fire quickly took off in steep terrain in the Salmon River Breaks, and burned 130,000 acres over 4 ½ months, causing millions in damage. 
One careless camper left a campfire unattended the morning after spending the night next to the Salmon River. Sparks from the campfire blew across the river into a steep canyon and suddenly the whole canyon was ablaze. All of this because of one person neglecting to do one of the most basic things when you go camping: put out your campfire until it’s dead-out! It must be doused with water until it’s cold to the touch.  
Humans can cause fires in other ways too: 

Vehicle fires occur along our highways and freeways from poorly maintained vehicles or flat tires that can turn into balls of fire.  
Dragging chains behind any kind of trailer.
Errant bullets can strike rocks and spark wildfires from shooters who don’t have a proper backstop. 
Sparks from chainsaws, motorbikes or ATVs can ignite wildfires in tall grass. 
Arson-caused fires … the unthinkable does happen! 

Dry conditions in the West make the risk of catastrophic wildfire from lightning that comes with afternoon thunderstorms very high. Firefighter staffing is limited within the region. When a human-caused fire starts, it can force firefighting professionals to respond to areas they wouldn’t otherwise have to be, and prevent them from responding quickly to lightning — caused fires that can quickly move across the landscape.

(Shalina Chatlani | Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court has set the date it will hear new arguments in a Louisiana case that could have ripple effects for congressional redistricting around the country.
The court will hear debate Oct. 15 in Callais v. Louisiana after asking both sides to file new briefs in response to its latest question: Could a state violate the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution when it draws election maps to comply with the Voting Rights Act?
The Callias case was filed by a group of non-Black voters in Louisiana after the legislature updated the state’s six congressional districts last year to carve out a second U.S. House seat to give a minority candidate a better chance of being elected. The 6th Congressional District was reconfigured to stretch from Baton Rouge to Shreveport, zig-zagging along the way to pick up pockets of Black voters.
The 14th Amendment, in part, addresses representation in Congress, while the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 strengthened provisions in these amendments, although the more conservative makeup of the Supreme Court over the past decade has peeled back some of those protections.

In the Callais case, justices are drilling down on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws and procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
Republican leaders in the legislature have said politics, not race, were the predominant influence on how the boundaries of their congressional map were drawn. Sen. Glen Womack, R-Harrisonburg, who authored the law that created the new districts, said its lines were specifically drawn to protect U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Speaker Mike Johnson – all Republicans. 
To craft another Black majority district, much of the old 6th District in and around Baton Rouge was redrawn to fall within Letlow’s 5th District. That led to the ouster of 6th District Congressman Garret Graves, who had aligned himself against the state’s most powerful Republicans. 
When Scalise was nominated for U.S. House speaker in the fall of 2023, Graves declined to support him out of loyalty to Kevin McCarthy, who had been removed from the post. In the Louisiana governor’s race that year, Graves endorsed longtime friend Stephen Waguespack, putting him at odds with the frontrunner and eventual winner, Jeff Landry.     
It was Landry, as the new governor in January 2024, who called the legislature into special session to revise the state’s congressional districts. As attorney general, his office defended a map lawmakers approved in February 2022 with a single Black-majority U.S. House seat despite the 2020 census showing Louisiana’s Black population had reached nearly one-third. Black voters challenged the map in federal court, and it was ruled unconstitutional.
How we got here: Louisiana’s redistricting case puts the Voting Rights Act on trial 

State lawmakers refused to budge, taking no action to update congressional districts during a second redistricting session in June 2022. This kept the lawsuit from earlier in the year, Robinson v. Ardoin, in play.
In October 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Alabama Legislature had to redo a map it approved with just one majority-minority district out of seven. Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the court’s liberals in determining the Alabama map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 
Lawmakers had to add a second Black district in Alabama, which has a smaller share of Black voters in Louisiana. The decision was considered a possible harbinger for Callais until the Supreme Court issued an order Aug. 1, seeking parties to submit briefs in response to its question about the 14th and 15th amendments.       
Attorney General Liz Murrill has until Aug. 27 to file her answers, while the plaintiffs have until Sept. 17. A ruling in the case isn’t expected until next spring. 
Murrill has offered no comments on the Callais case since the Supreme Court’s Aug. 1 order, only saying in a statement Tuesday she will make herself available for interviews after the state files its brief. Louisiana Solicitor General Ben Aguiñaga will argue on behalf of the state, she added.
At the court’s initial hearing on Callais in March, Aguiñaga told justices that Louisiana’s congressional map was created in response to federal court rulings that required the addition of a second majority-Black district. 
He also mentioned that the state feels Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional, but state lawmakers opted to redraw its maps because Louisiana had lost prior court cases making that same argument.
The Louisiana case has been pushed to backburner news status as redistricting showdowns in other states have gained prominence. Mid-decade congressional map changes are rare, but Republican governors loyal to President Donald Trump are aggressively pushing their GOP-majority legislatures to add red U.S. House seats to offset possible losses in next year’s mid-term elections. Democratic state leaders are positioning themselves for countermoves.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Thirty minutes, every other month was all it took for Tina McDonald to make a difference in the lives of Claudia Dunagan and her nonagenarian mother, Hazel.
Armed with a smile and a bag of sterilized foot care equipment, McDonald, a wound and ostomy nurse, skillfully and gently trimmed the thick toenails that Hazel, a homebound diabetic, could no longer care for herself.
For 16 months, it was the perfect solution. Until it wasn’t. 
Two months after Hazel’s 100th birthday, in January 2024, McDonald texted Dunagan to cancel their upcoming appointment. The Rhode Island Department of Health had issued a cease and desist order, forcing her to halt the business she’d begun 12 years earlier, unknowingly violating state laws governing foot care. 
Dunagan, 77, searched for an alternative, asking certified nursing assistants and home hospice nurses, even considering a peducurist willing to come to her Providence condo. Their answers were the same: “We can’t touch feet.” 
Basic foot care is especially crucial, but also more complicated, for people with diabetes, arthritis and other underlying blood and vascular conditions, which are also more prevalent in seniors. Lack of regular nail trims and callus shaving can lead to serious medical consequences, including infections and falls.
“There was no one in the entire state,” Dunagan said in a recent interview. “I had zero options.”
Legislation introduced this year by Rep. Jennifer Boylan, a Barrington Democrat, sought to give the mother-daughter duo, and others like them, a solution. The bill would clarify the uncertainty in state law by explicitly allowing certified nurses to perform routine preventive and maintenance foot care at home. It seemed an obvious solution —  one allowed in every state in the country except Rhode Island.
“It sounds trivial to someone who is healthy and can reach their feet, but as soon as you can’t, it’s not,” Boylan said. “It’s quite frankly unacceptable that people are going without care. In an elderly population, every day, every month counts.”
Boylan’s bill won unanimous support in the Rhode Island House in a June 12 vote. But it failed to advance in the Rhode Island Senate, and ultimately, died without even a hearing before the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services. 
Greg Paré, a spokesperson for the Senate, said it was a timing and logistics problem — without a Senate companion, the chamber had to wait till Boylan’s bill passed the House to consider it. There just wasn’t enough time before the 2025 legislative session ended on June 21.
“Should a version of this legislation come before the Senate earlier in next year’s session, it will be reviewed,” Paré said in an email.
Boylan pledged to reintroduce the same, revised bill early in the 2026 session. She already has a Senate sponsor, Sen. Lori Urso, a Pawtucket Democrat.

350 people on waiting list
Dunagan’s mother died in February 2024. But hundreds of homebound seniors and their caregivers are still searching for someone to provide the basic foot care critical for safety, wellness, and dignity.
McDonald amassed a 350-person waiting list during the four months of 2023 when she paused her practice while the state nursing board conducted a review after receiving an anonymous complaint.
State nursing law doesn’t explicitly prohibit nurses from providing home foot care. They don’t name it as a provided service, either. Meanwhile, a separate section of state law governing podiatry stipulates that only licensed podiatrists can treat feet.
The state health department cited the podiatry law as the reason why McDonald could not provide home foot care.
“The nursing regulations are vague,” McDonald said. “To me, this falls within our nursing practice, but I didn’t want to risk losing my license.”
Lynda D’Alessia, state nursing director, did not respond to inquiries for comment.










 There was no one in the entire state. I had zero options. 


– Claudia Dunagan of Providence on her fruitless search for home foot care for her nonagenarian mother, Hazel.


McDonald has now rebuilt her business to exclusively focus on Massachusetts, and has  a contract with Bristol Aging & Wellness, a nonprofit serving seniors in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her former patients did not fare as well.
Anne Hagan, a home hospice nurse who lives in Warwick, wrote to lawmakers with a litany of stories, including a homebound veteran whose neglected toenails had grown so long and thick he couldn’t trim them with standard clippers. He eventually took a jacknife to his nails, ending up in a “pool of blood,” Hagan wrote. 
Leigh Anne Cappello, a Barrington resident, described an aging family member whose foot cyst became infected after it went undetected.
“It is easy to go unnoticed since their feet are largely covered in socks, slippers or shoes,” Cappello wrote. “What could have been addressed with some basic foot health/hygiene care turns into a more difficult problem that can even affect mobility — something that is so critical to their overall health.”
McDonald sympathized in her testimony to House lawmakers during a March 27 hearing on Boylan’s bill.
“If you’ve never been a family caregiver, it is difficult to imagine the stress, exhaustion, isolation and grief that one experiences,” McDonald told House lawmakers who serve on the Committee on Health and Human Services. “As access to services outside the home becomes less accessible, the pressure on the caregiver increases. Nurses need to be allowed to fill in the gaps, to let people age in place with dignity.”
The Rhode Island Developmental Disabilities Council, the Rhode Island Nurses Association, AARP and a host of local senior services agencies backed Boylan’s bill, too. 
Many were surprised to learn that home foot care nurses weren’t already allowed.
“Everybody seemed genuinely unaware of this gap in services,” said Carol Anne Costa, executive director for the Senior Agenda Coalition of Rhode Island. 










Everybody seemed genuinely unaware of this gap in services. 


– Carol Anne Costa, executive director for the Senior Agenda Coalition of Rhode Island. 


Costa expects the gap will widen as Rhode Island’s senior population swells and its residents look to live out their final years at home.
“As a rule, we have been very successful in enabling older adults to age in place,” Costa said. “With that success naturally comes the need for more services to sustain them in their homes.”
Podiatrists push back 
Representatives from the American Podiatric Medical Association and the Rhode Island Podiatric Medical Association wrote to lawmakers with concerns over the health and safety implications of letting nurses provide home care to patients whose age or other diagnoses — like diabetes — make even routine trimmings more risky.
“While routine foot care sounds nice, more often than not, it is not routine and it is more than foot care,” Dr. Sarah Cathcart, vice president of the Rhode Island Podiatric Medical Association, told lawmakers during the March 27 committee hearing. 
Cathcart works at South County Foot and Ankle in Warwick, and said she, and most other podiatrists, make house calls outside of regular office hours.
But, Cathcart acknowledged when questioned by lawmakers, home visits are usually to existing patients — not new ones. 
And federal Medicare rules require that any patients receiving care at home from a podiatrist first secure a medical necessity determination from a primary care provider. 
“I have to protect my license and my practice,” Dr. Michael Reuter, a podiatrist with Brown University Health in East Providence, told lawmakers during the committee hearing.
The Rhode Island Podiatric Medical Association and its members did not respond to follow-up inquiries.
McDonald doesn’t take insurance, and therefore doesn’t need any paperwork to make a house call. She charges $100 per visit, seeing 30 to 40 people weekly. Podiatrists told lawmakers they treat a couple people at home per week, or less.
Seeking to assuage podiatric concerns, Boylan changed her bill between its initial committee hearing and approval on the House floor, adding more specific requirements to the training and scope of services that qualifying nurses could provide. She also moved the proposal from the state law governing podiatrists to the section on nursing, modeling the language after the advisory rules set by the Massachusetts Board of Nursing.
 The health department did not take a position on Boylan’s bill.
“We would only take a position if something in a piece of legislation represented a health or safety concern, or if we believed that our support for a bill would clarify its benefits for legislators and the public,” Joseph Wendelken, a spokesperson for the health department, said in an emailed response. 
Claudia Dunagan never found someone else to trim Hazel’s toenails after McDonald was ordered to stop coming. Her last view of Hazel after she died was of her feet, the long, curling toenails peeking out from beneath the blanket covering her mother’s body.
“When I saw her feet, that was the one relief I had that she died then, because there was no one to care for them,” Dunagan said.

BEREA — A safer era for Madison County and the region is just three months away, according to the governor’s top man for overseeing the destruction of chemical weapons previously stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot.
Craig Williams, a Berea resident and Vietnam veteran, has been leading the way to decommission the toxic gasses for the past 40 years after he learned they were to be disposed of dangerously. 
“The Army was going to incinerate them. Obviously, that was a bad idea,” Williams told The Edge in a sideline interview at the first regularly scheduled Berea City Council meeting of August. 
The decommissioning of these weapons was federally declared 100% complete in July of 2023. The declaration referred to actual weapons, according to Williams, who told The Edge that the remaining materials are not explosive, and so were not included in the terms of the decommissioning.

“There already are no chemical weapons in Kentucky. There are chemical warfare agent-contaminated weapon components that are being destroyed now,” said Williams, co-chair of the Kentucky Chemical Demilitarization Citizens’ Advisory Commission which is appointed by the governor.
 Nerve gas contamination

During his presentation, which included multiple slides, Williams told the Berea council that as of Aug. 4, more than 89% of the 17,739 warheads containing residual amounts of nerve agent VX have been destroyed. In the past two months alone, Williams said more than 2,400 of these contaminated warheads were destroyed. 
Contaminated warheads containing residual amounts of nerve agent GB have been 98% destroyed, Williams said, adding that in June and July of this year, 5,500 of these warheads were destroyed. 
In the past year, the decommissioning project’s recordable safety incident rate was 0.16, and that as of June 30, 17,122,130 hours and 2,117 days have been completed on the project without a lost-time accident, according to Williams. 
“Every time I go out there, I am always impressed that these folks have gotten rid of all these chemical weapons without any serious incidents. It’s a remarkable accomplishment,” Williams told the council. 
Many other necessary infrastructure changes have been made to prepare for the demolition of the main chemical plant at the depot, scheduled for summer 2026, according to Williams.
Chips from the concrete “igloos” (concrete bunkers) that housed the chemical weapons are now being analyzed, Williams said, and the environmental team on the project awaits the results. The entire warhead destruction portion of the project is now slated for completion by November of this year, he said. 
“We’ve been working on this project for 40 years. It never ceases to amaze me how many agencies and procedures you have to go through in order to get one item checked off the list,” Williams told council. “However, they are making extremely good progress.”
 Job losses

A reduction in force at the depot has been tied to project milestones, according to Williams, who said that at one time there had been 1,460 employees, but the drawdown now leaves just over 900 workers there. Another 200 employees are scheduled to be laid off now through the fall, Williams said. There has been a 57%  placement rate of Blue Grass Army Depot workers into roles elsewhere, once their work at the depot was complete, according to Williams. 
Bechtel Parsons Bluegrass held a job fair for displaced depot workers Tuesday at the Madison County Fairgrounds. Participating companies included Enersys, Hyster Yale, Georgetown Municipal Water & Sewer, Qualex, and others, Williams said. 
 Economic impact

Williams said the decommissioning’s economic impact has been significant. Half of the project is staffed with local hires, he said. Also, well over $200 million has been spent with Kentucky companies, with more than half of that spent in Madison County, according to Williams. More than $1.4 billion in payroll have been paid to local workers, he said. 
Defense bill paves way for ‘new missions’ at Blue Grass Army Depot, says McConnell

Williams also told The Edge that Kentucky’s retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell was instrumental to the safety mission. “He was the spearhead on the political side of things,” Williams said, noting that there were many others who also helped ensure the weapons were disposed of in a manner not harmful to residents. Williams said McConnell got involved directly in 1996.
“Once he understood our position on the technology (that could help destroy the weapons safely), and we demonstrated to him that not only were we advocating that, but there was a broad section of scientific engineering and environmental scrutiny being given to what (the Army)proposed to do, and he realized that that was not safe for anybody, then he helped us out,” Williams said. 
 Gratitude

“I appreciate everyone taking the time to listen, and I anticipate probably one or two more presentations as time goes on. Then I will bid a fond farewell to chemical weapons and my role in it, and I will be joyously working in my garden instead of making slides for y’all,” Williams concluded. 
Williams was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2006 for leading a national grassroots coalition that convinced the Pentagon to halt plans to burn four chemical weapons stockpiles, including the one in Kentucky, and instead use a chemical-neutralization process to dispose of the deadly substances.
Councilmember John Payne commended Williams.
“I just want to say thank you,” Payne said. “It’s been a decades-long endeavor to remove these toxic materials from Madison County, and I think we all feel a little bit safer for it.”
“I know I do,” Williams said.

Thomas Massie is almost alone among Republicans in pushing back on the government’s Epstein cover-up, writes John Schaaf. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)As Kentucky U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie asserts strong positions in opposition to President Donald Trump, he increasingly looks like the future of the Republican Party.
Americans who appreciate political courage, including Trump supporters, are celebrating Massie’s push for release of the “Epstein files,” the records of the criminal investigation into the late pedophile and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
Massie is laser-focused on forcing the U.S. Department of Justice to release the files, as Trump is backtracking on his repeated promises to let the public know who witnessed or participated in Epstein’s crimes.
Principled politicians willing to oppose their own party are hard to find, particularly in Washington, D.C., where office seekers need millions of dollars to pay for their campaigns, and don’t want to offend their party leaders and potential donors by taking a stand. 
Musk enters Massie-Trump fray as two Kentucky Republicans buck president on his ‘beautiful’ bill

Massie is clearly aggravating Trump by calling for release of investigative records in which the president’s name reportedly appears because of his close friendship with Epstein.
Massie is sponsoring a House Resolution requiring Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice” connected to Epstein.  
In the four years between his first and second terms, Trump and his supporters frequently called for the release of the files.  Vice President JD Vance, Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, Donald Trump Jr., and others like Sean Hannity were particularly adamant about “transparency” and “holding people accountable.”  
A few months ago, on Hannity’s show, Bondi said the FBI received a “truckload” of Epstein evidence, and “everything’s going to come out to the public. The public has the right to know.”
On June 5, Trump’s close adviser Elon Musk posted on X:  “Time to drop the really big bomb, realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.  That is the real reason they have not been made public.” Musk then wrote: “Mark this post for the future.  The truth will come out.”
Weeks later, the Justice Department released a memo stating “no further disclosure (of Epstein information) would be appropriate or warranted.”
Massie is almost alone among Republicans in pushing back on the government’s Epstein cover-up, and in doing so, he offers his party hope for the future. Trump got millions of votes from people who saw him as the anti-politician who would take on Washington’s elite political class, expose years of wrongdoing and punish whoever was doing it.
Recently, on “Meet the Press,” Massie said: “The release of the Epstein files is emblematic of what Trump ran for and why he got the populist vote.  There seems to be a class of people beyond the law, beyond the judicial system … and we all thought that when Trump was elected, he would be the bull in the china shop, and he would break that up and bring transparency.”
“They’re the ones — it’s the president’s own attorney general, FBI director, children … and vice president who said these files need to be released,” Massie said. “We’re just trying to hold their feet to the fire.”
If the Epstein cover-up continues, more Trump supporters could move away from the president and toward leaders like Massie, who fight for transparency and against dishonest dealings that Republicans hoped Trump would banish from Washington.
This could mean bright political prospects for Massie.  In Kentucky’s 2026 U.S. Senate race, three Trump bootlickers are groveling for the president’s endorsement, which may be far less valuable next year than they hope. 
Although Massie hasn’t recently expressed interest in the Senate race, there’s a lane open for him because he has a political philosophy that lines up with most Republicans, but includes an independent, anti-corruption streak that appeals to voters looking for a consistent conservative who’s willing to fight the establishment.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)A board that oversees the management of critical forage fish menhaden along the Atlantic coast is looking into further restricting Virginia’s only commercial menhaden reduction fishery.
Last week, the Atlantic States Marine Commission’s menhaden management board voted to task a workgroup with determining options for spreading out menhaden reduction fishing caps throughout the year to manage the fish populations in the Chesapeake Bay.
This would only impact Ocean Harvesters, owned by Reedville-based Omega Protein, which is already under reduction fishing caps of 51,000 metric tons. This fishery reduces the fish into oil and fishmeal. Smaller fisheries in the bay use the fish for bait. Some sportsfishers and environmentalists believe too many menhaden are being fished from the Chesapeake. One group of anglers recently penned a letter to President Donald Trump to sign an executive order to protect the fish.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition, conversely, feels the Virginia reduction fishery has been unfairly blamed for issues in the entire ecosystem that could potentially be attributed to environmental challenges, however, more data is needed to nail down the specific impacts on menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay.
Fewer fish prompts quest for more data
Lynn Fegley of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources introduced the motion to begin exploring further restrictions on Omega Protein. Fegley said a smaller fishery in her state is suffering because menhaden are not reaching their shores. She claimed that the population of fish is being accounted for in other parts of the Chesapeake Bay, but they are not seeing enough of them in the northern bay.
“The reduction fisheries’ pressure has been increasing in the middle part of the summer… and potentially leading to a choke point where that biomass of menhaden isn’t making its way into Maryland,” said Will Poston, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s forage fish manager. “Maryland’s small scale commercial fisheries, which are stationary gears, pound nets that have a well established time series of data.”
Maryland experienced a major fish kill of thousands of mostly juvenile menhaden washing up on their shores in the summer of 2024 that was attributed to low oxygen due to water quality issues.
“We understand that this is a coast-wide issue. We understand that things are changing … there is significant effort by a large-scale fishery in the Chesapeake Bay. The fish were there but they were not where we are,” Fegley said.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition fired back on allegations their operations are bottlenecking the nutrient-rich fish and preventing them from reaching farther up the Chesapeake Bay to Maryland fisheries, as well as leading to osprey populations decreasing.
“Now, when fishermen report low summer menhaden catch, Maryland frames the pound net fishery as a targeted menhaden fishery under threat from Virginia’s “intercept” fleet—itself an incredible stretch to suggest six menhaden fishing boats “blockade” the lower Chesapeake Bay,” the coalition’s statement read.
Fegley also led an effort last year to look into “precautionary management” methods. A workgroup compiled a list of ideas on how to manage the concerns around the menhaden populations but frequently mentioned the need for more data.
The commission’s stock report of menhaden accepted in 2022 for all of the Atlantic Coast states that menhaden are not overfished. But some environmentalists believe that the Chesapeake Bay populations specifically are in decline and the data is getting lost in the big picture. 
“I am not saying this is an intercept fishery. What I am saying is that the conditions are changing in such a way that we are having a real fishery problem in Maryland. This is not just about Maryland, it is about an ecosystem that supports the coast,” Fegley said.
Due to the drop in striped bass and osprey populations that rely on the forage fish to survive, conservationists are eager to find a solution. The U.S. Geological Survey presented to the board last summer about the osprey decline.
“Their findings suggested that while the Chesapeake Bay osprey decline was real, it likely stemmed from a complex array of ecological stressors, not simply the availability of menhaden. In fact, USGS explicitly did not attribute osprey declines to menhaden harvest pressure,” the Menhaden Fisheries Coalition said in a statement.
Commercial fishing yields of menhaden have also reportedly dropped in recent years according to Fegley and other board members, leading them to look for any insight into why it is happening. There have been state-level efforts to fund research in the Virginia General Assembly into the bay’s menhaden populations but those efforts have not been successful.
“The Chesapeake’s fisheries and predators can’t wait. Menhaden are key to a thriving Chesapeake Bay, and a healthy, productive Chesapeake is vital to the entire Atlantic coast,” said Chris Moore, Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Executive Director. “We appreciate the efforts of those on the ASMFC menhaden management board who have worked to keep this important issue at the forefront.” 
In a press release response to comments made by Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Ocean Harvest said “(CBF) omits mention of well-documented water quality issues in Maryland that may also explain the localized fishery observations cited.”
The workgroup will collect data on the possibility of the reduction fishing caps being shifted to different parts of the seasons, as members of the board shared insight into the menhaden populations showing up in the Chesapeake later in the year. The work group will present their ideas on how to manage the fishery caps at the ASMC winter 2026 board meeting.
The board members said “something is going on” but they aren’t sure why the fish are arriving late and not approaching the shore as much as they used to. Fourteen of the board members voted in favor of the work group, with the representatives from Virginia and New Jersey voting against it.
Some of the members pointed out that there are similar concerns around menhaden yields, striped bass population decline, and osprey decline along the coast outside of the Chesapeake Bay. They want to focus research into the cause and how to protect the fish beyond imposing additional restrictions on the one fishery. 
“The only real recourse to ensure the health of the ecosystem is to err on the side of conservation and be more risk averse in how (to) manage this industrial fishery that concentrates so much effort in and around Chesapeake Bay,” Poston said.
The 2024 workgroup made multiple recommendations on how to obtain better data around the menhaden populations, such as seasonal or area closures for menhaden reduction fishing, quota days or periods, restricting some gear usage, or further reducing the menhaden reduction fishing cap.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)North Carolinians were able to provide public comment on a natural gas pipeline at a hearing Tuesday evening, the latest step in the MVP Southgate project cutting through the state.
The Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources (DWR) held the hearing so members of the public could make their voices heard on Mountain Valley Pipeline’s LLC application for a 401 water quality certification.
Mountain Valley Pipeline segment ruptures during test

Running through Rockingham and Alamance counties, the pipeline has been controversial project for years. DEQ denied a water quality permit for the Southgate project in 2020, NC Newsline previously reported.
Out of roughly 150 comments received in advance of Tuesday’s hearing, only three were in favor of the project: one, a coalition of pipeliners, another an individual who is affiliated with the pipeliners union, and a third person who did not indicate their affiliation.
Hundreds of members of the Pipeliners Local Union 798 signed a letter backing the project.
“In addition to the tax revenue and job creation that MVP Southgate is poised to generate, this project’s approval is clearly in the region’s best interest, as it secures access to domestically sourced natural gas, safely and efficiently transporting it back to consumers that need it most,” Danny Hendrix, the union’s business manager, wrote in a supporting statement.
The union’s letter highlights the financial opportunities and jobs that could be created by the project.
MVP Southgate would invest $21 million into North Carolina’s economy and support more than 200 jobs in the state, according to the letter.
Hendrix also cited a rising need for natural gas in the region and said the project has “consistently demonstrated a commitment to environmental-sustainable goals” by adhering to feedback from members of the community.
“MVP Southgate is a central part of making a reliable supply of natural gas available for residents and small business owners in the region,” the letter continued.
The bulk of the submitted comments oppose the project, with some entries spanning dozens and even hundreds of pages.
Some came from organizations like the Southern Environmental Law Center or Wild Virginia. Others were submissions from individuals simply indicating  that they did not agree with the project.
Blakely Hildebrand, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, wrote the group’s opposition to the application.
She cited DWR’s denial of MVP’s original 401 water quality certification more than five years ago due to its “anticipated significant adverse impacts” to water quality in the state.
“MVP’s record of compliance with water quality laws and regulations in other states is abysmal,” Hildebrand wrote. “Virginia and West Virginia have issued dozens of notices of violation to MVP for its failure to project waterways in those states during construction of the MVP Mainline project.”
David Sligh, conservation director at Wild Virginia, focused on the proposed project’s impact to the environment in his letter on behalf of his group.
Pollutants from the project would enter Virginia since the Dan River flows downstream into the state from the project’s areas.
“While the direct discharges addressed in the application for MVP Southgate enter streams and wetlands in North Carolina, impacts from the project would affect Virginia waters and Wild Virginia’s interests,” he wrote.

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Breakthrough T1D)U.S. Sen. Susan Collins drew President Donald Trump’s ire last week in a departure from the  unusual deference he has shown toward the Maine Republican. 
Trump told Republicans in a Truth Social post, “when in doubt, vote the exact opposite” of Collins, not referencing any vote in particular. “Generally speaking, you can’t go wrong,” Trump wrote. “Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
Political scientists see the jab as notable but refrained from speculating about whether it signals a shift in their relationship or Collins’ political future, as she is up for reelection in 2026. Maine Republicans and Trump have rejected the idea of forcing a primary on Collins, though someone familiar with the conversation told Politico recently that the president would love to see a “better option.”
Despite the president’s comment, Collins’ approach to Trump hasn’t changed much during his second term, said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. Rather, Brewer said, how Maine’s senior senator continues to handle disagreements with his administration illustrates that she is continuing to try to find a middle ground. 
“She’s been operating the way that she’s, I think, consistently operated,” Brewer said. “She’ll say this publicly, when she doesn’t agree with what the president’s doing, she’ll vote against him. Other times, if she’s supportive of the policy, maybe not necessarily some of the things he does but the underlying policy, she’ll vote in favor of it.” 
Collins has packed millions of dollars into spending bills for Maine. Will it materialize?

That was exactly her response when asked about the president’s criticism of her voting record. “I cast each vote based on what is right for Maine and America,” Collins said in a statement. “Sometimes that means I agree with the President and sometimes I disagree.”
When Maine Morning Star spoke to voters this past spring about Collins’ role during Trump’s second term, some constituents critiqued her piecemeal approach to fighting his cuts to federal programs and funding, arguing that a focus on Trump’s individual actions wouldn’t be effective in deterring the president as he convoluted the federal government’s system of checks and balances. 
That balancing act is currently being tested on an issue Collins has been a vocal proponent of: medical research. 
Public comments
The first full hearing this Congress of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which Collins chairs, was titled “Biomedical research: Keeping America’s edge in innovation.” During her opening remarks, Collins emphasized that the research was a high priority for the committee and stated that no investment pays greater dividends to Americans. 
“Very troubling are the administration’s abrupt cancellation of grants, proposals to slash federal funding, and laying off scientists and technical experts with apparently little or no justification,” Collins said. “These actions put our leadership in biomedical innovation at real risk and must be reversed.”
The Trump administration has also been slow to disburse National Institutes of Health funding as the end of the fiscal year approaches on September 30. Collins and 13 of her Republican colleagues sent a letter to Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, late last month to share their concerns. 
In their attempt to encourage follow through, the Republicans made appeals to the president’s agenda to slash anything he views as government waste, stating that they believed NIH leadership would ensure the funds are “not diverted to ideological or unaccountable programs.” 
This approach was markedly different from comments by Congress’ top Democratic appropriators, including Washington Sen. Patty Murray, who said in a statement, “this administration is lying about waste, fraud, and abuse at NIH to justify attacking medical research.”
The administration has since backtracked on funds frozen during what they chalked up to a “programmatic review” but hasn’t fully addressed the widespread delay of disbursements.
This week, the Government Accountability Office, an independent congressional watchdog, concluded that the Trump administration violated federal law when canceling NIH grants and slowing new awards.
Votes 
While lawmakers on both sides of the aisle issued statements advocating for the research funds, a legislative proposal was brought forward. 
Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois proposed an amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education appropriations bill that would have reinstated NIH and other grants that the Trump administration terminated. Stating the issue was not partisan, Durbin listed off examples from several states impacted by such cuts, including Maine, when introducing the amendment. 
“Sen. Collins, Maine Health: two awards canceled or frozen totaling $323,000, including research to focus on rural health needs, and Mount Desert Island Biological Lab has one $5 million award frozen,” Durbin said during the committee meeting. 
Collins, the last to vote, rejected that amendment, which narrowly failed 14-15.
Collins’ Communications Director Phoebe Ferraiolo said the amendment was “too broadly drafted and would make it impossible for this administration and future administrations to cancel any grants, including grants that were failing or duplicative.”
“Senator Collins believes that, regardless of who is in the White House, the administration should be provided the ability to review these programs,” Ferraiolo added. 
That sort of blanket treatment is something Collins has often pointed to when defending her record, specifically on procedural votes. It’s also something some constituents have critiqued as inadequate as Trump has upended established procedure. They’ve also critiqued what they see as Collins’ piecemeal approach to funding restorations. 
When explaining that Collins has had success with pushing back on Trump administration decisions she disagrees with, Ferraiolo pointed to the reinstatement of some NIH grants in June for Jackson Laboratory, MDI Biological Laboratory and MaineHealth. Collins previously highlighted her ability to restore some cuts through her conversations out of public view in an interview with Maine Morning Star this past spring.
However, the overall structure of how NIH grants will be awarded going forward, and therefore these organizations’ funding long term, is at risk. 
Upended procedure
The president’s change in tone on Collins comes as Congress approaches the deadline to pass spending bills for the next fiscal year. The early version of the the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education appropriations bill and others, which Collins had a hand in crafting, signal lawmakers may not give the president as large of cuts as he wants.
Susan Collins has reached a pinnacle of authority. How will she use it?

In the marked up version of the labor, health and education bill, which will advance to the full Senate after lawmakers return from August recess, the committee largely rejected the Trump administration’s proposals to slash funding for medical research grants and other programs. 
Included is a $150 million increase for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer’s disease research, as well as a ban on an administration cap on indirect costs at the NIH, according to a summary from Democrats. 
Collins questioned NIH Director Jayanta Bhattacharya in February on the proposed cap on how much NIH pays research universities and medical schools for indirect costs. She’s also said it’s against federal law. The cap is currently the subject of a permanent injunction in an ongoing lawsuit. 
Brewer said, in some ways, the current appropriations cycle appears to be returning to its typical procedures.
“They’ve put some money back in from some things that Trump wanted to take out,” Brewer said. “As long as we stay on that, quote unquote, more normal process, then I think [Collins’] role as chair of appropriations once again becomes very important.”
However, Brewer is hesitant that that will be the case. 
“Democrats are saying, ‘Well, look, we’re not going to negotiate spending packages when you’re out there ripping money back after we’ve already approved it,’” Brewer said. 
When it comes to NIH research, even if Collins and other members of Congress can secure increased funding for the agency, the Trump administration’s budget maneuvers have set up the NIH to be able to receive fewer grants. 
The NIH started changing the way it funds grants earlier this year, front-loading funds so researchers receive all money on day one rather than the NIH having to build years-long research grants in its budget. 
The shift is already lowering the chances that a scientist’s proposal will receive funding and many, including Collins, have raised concern that this method could result in future reductions.
Congress cannot stop the administration from forward-funding grants, Collins told Roll Call.

Ohio’s minimum wage is $10.70 per hour for non-tipped employees and $5.35 per hour for tipped employees. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. 
“We’ve got a crisis of affordability right now,” Smith said. “And some of how you fix the crisis of affordability is you make sure people have more money in their pockets from the jobs they work.” 
The bill would raise the state’s minimum wage to $12 per hour starting Jan. 1, 2026; $13 per hour in 2027; $14 per hour in 2028; and $15 per hour in 2029. 
The state’s commerce director would then adjust the minimum wage every year on Sept. 30, starting with 2029. The new minimum wage would still take effect on Jan. 1 every year. 
“We believe that it increases the purchasing and saving power of working Ohioans,” Craig said. “… We want families, no matter where you are, to have a livable wage.” 
The bill would also eliminate the tipped employee minimum wage and require all employees to be paid the state’s minimum wage. 
“I think it’s important to also raise the tip worker minimum wage, which is one of the main focuses of the bill because those folks seem to be stuck in poverty if they’ve got a tipped wage occupation,” Smith said. 
This is not the first time Smith and Craig have introduced a bill that would increase the minimum wage. 
The duo introduced a bill during the last General Assembly that would have raised the minimum wage until it was up to $15 an hour in 2027, but it only was given time for sponsor testimony.  
Ohioans passed a constitutional amendment in 2006 that increases the state minimum wage every year based on the consumer price index. 
Ohio House Democrats have also introduced a bill that would raise the state’s minimum wage. 
State Reps. Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, and Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus, introduced Ohio House Bill 34, which would also increase the state’s minimum wage gradually per year, but S.B. 234 would get to $15 per hour faster. 
Under H.B. 34, the state’s minimum wage would increase to $11 per hour on Jan. 1, 2026, $12 per hour in 2027, $13 per hour in 2028, $14 per hour in 2029 and $15 per hour in 2030.

Ohioans need to be making at least $22.51 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to a recent report by Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio and the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
“People are getting squeezed … between rents, health insurance and public utility costs, all of those are going up substantially,” Smith said. “… We need to make those arguments and lay them at the feet of the (Republican) majority and be like ‘You’re running this government. What are you going to do about it?’ Here’s one of the things you can do.”

Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
Many medical treatments could be affected by Supreme Court transgender ruling

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
More states pass laws restricting transgender people’s bathroom use

State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.


– Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in New York City whose research focuses on gender and sexuality


Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

Gerrymandering. Most Americans are familiar with this phenomenon in which politicians rig electoral maps and elections for partisan purposes. But unless you’re a serious political observer, you may not be up to speed on just how far out of control this practice has gotten of late or, indeed, how unless something is done soon, it could spiral out of control.
And make no mistake: the threat is real. Right now, in Texas, Republican legislators are, at the urging of President Trump, attempting to make a mockery of the 2026 midterm elections by rigging congressional maps in unprecedented ways. And this situation is only fueling efforts in other states – by Republicans and Democrats – to follow suit. It’s a frightening situation that, as we’ve seen repeatedly in North Carolina, makes general elections uncompetitive and gives candidates from the middle no chance of winning.
The bottom line: Gerrymandering has come to be one of the greatest threats to American democracy and it’s essential that congressional leaders at some point soon muster the courage to end it.

(Photo by Avelino Gomez G via iStock/Getty Images Plus)Starting Jan. 1, New Hampshire will place a $3.50 per ton surcharge on all solid waste taken at any of the state’s six active landfills or its waste-to-energy facility.
The surcharge was included in the state budget signed into law in June. The state plans to use the revenue to fund salaries for waste management officials at the Department of Environmental Services and to support grant projects focused on improving waste disposal infrastructure across the state. This type of surcharge is common in other states, including neighboring Vermont and Massachusetts.
The fee will be paid by municipalities, businesses, and other institutions, but New Hampshire towns and cities will receive a 100% quarterly rebate.
Roughly 1.9 million tons of trash were disposed of in New Hampshire in 2022, according to the most recent data available from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. At $3.50 per ton, 1.9 million tons would’ve generated roughly $6.7 million had the surcharge been in effect at the time, though some of that would’ve been rebated to towns and cities.
Of the 1.9 million tons in 2022, roughly 1.1 million tons — about 58% — came from municipalities, though it’s unclear from the data how many of those municipalities were in New Hampshire and how many were out-of-state. But almost half of the total (both municipal and non-municipal) — or roughly 820,000 tons — came from out-of-state sources, mostly nearby states with more restrictive waste regulations. The large amount of out-of-state trash being dumped in New Hampshire has been a focus of those advocating for changes in the state’s landfill system.
Reagan Bissonnette, an expert on solid waste issues, said that’s why the rebate applies only to in-state municipalities.
“If the state simply wanted to stop waste from coming into the state from out of state, they wouldn’t be able to simply say ‘no trash can come here from Vermont or Maine or Massachusetts,’” she said. “That would actually violate the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. So this disposal fee is designed in such a way that the burden will primarily be on anyone from out of state who’s disposing waste in New Hampshire, and any business sources or institutions that are disposing of waste in New Hampshire. So municipalities are really the ones most benefiting here.”
Bissonnette is a member of the state’s Solid Waste Working Group, which was created by the state Legislature to advise DES, and is the executive director of NH Recycles, a nonprofit created by New Hampshire municipalities that helps communities develop and improve recycling systems. She sees the fee as a positive.
“Certainly the cost of disposal will go up for businesses and out-of-state entities,” she said. “But for New Hampshire municipalities, I do see this as a real positive, because my expectation is that New Hampshire municipalities will be able to readily apply for grants in the future to help them maybe purchase a baler to compact their recycling, or to pay for new equipment at their facility that’s going to help them recycle better. Also, the grants will be available for small businesses that may be looking to get into composting food waste in the state.”
Bissonnette, a strong proponent of recycling and someone who works in the field, is also happy this will create an added incentive for businesses and institutions facing the fee to grow their recycling program.
Bissonnette said rates to dispose of waste at a landfill or waste-to-energy facility are currently anywhere from $60 to $90 a ton, “so in the big scheme of things, $3.50 is not a huge number, but certainly when you aggregate it across all of the waste disposed of New Hampshire, it’s going to raise a meaningful amount of money.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/trashblock-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-13 05:57:42.922056
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-13 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Sales tax holidays under fire as CT launches its promotion,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/ct-sales-tax-holidays/,"CT's sales tax holiday, from Sunday through Aug. 23, exempts clothing under $100 from the 6.35% sales tax. Some say it doesn't do much good.","For decades, Connecticut officials have been trumpeting the annual sales-tax-free week, including this year’s promotion, which begins Sunday and runs through Aug. 23.
But such sales tax holidays increasingly are coming under fire from policy groups.
Progressive organizations note that relatively brief exemption periods, usually limited to a week or even just a weekend, deliver extremely modest relief to consumers, often helping poor households the least.
And other groups argue these promotions are equally ineffective at boosting the economy, adding that the hype from politicians far exceeds the impact.
“Since sales tax holidays shift the timing of demand but do little to increase its magnitude, sales tax holidays reduce state and local tax collections for little or no economic benefit,” analysts Katherine Loughead and Brayden Myers wrote for in a recent brief for the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, Washington-based policy group.
Consumers generally don’t make enough “impulse” purchases — extra buys they wouldn’t have made — were it not for the holiday, the analysts wrote. Instead, they simply defer purchases that normally would have been made earlier in the year to take advantage of the sales tax promotion.
In Connecticut, that promotion involves waiving the 6.35% sales tax levy on clothing and footwear items that cost less than $100, whether purchased in-store or online, according to the state Department of Revenue Services.
Nineteen states either have held or are scheduled to hold such promotions in 2025, along with one municipality in Alaska, according to the Tax Foundation.
Besides clothing, other items commonly featured in sales tax holidays in other states include computers, energy efficiency equipment, books and other school supplies. 
And while proponents argue these promotions draw out-of-state consumers into the local economy, Loughead and Myers counter that “since so many states now have tax holidays, and because the holidays often apply to lower-cost items that wouldn’t justify a large detour, their effect in attracting out-of-state purchasers is doubtful.”
Critics say states would better serve their economies by focusing resources on reducing everyday tax rates.
And they aren’t the only ones.
The Connecticut Retail Merchants Association has said some Connecticut businesses count on this annual mid-August promotion to secure a huge chunk of their annual profits.
The National Federation of Independent Businesses has long endorsed such sales tax promotions. NFIB Connecticut State Director Andrew Markowski said, “We think it’s a good economic driver and it helps get feet in the doors.”
But Markowski also said Connecticut officials should focus “getting on a more even playing field” with neighboring states when it comes to the sales tax. Massachusetts has a 6.25% sales tax rate and exempts clothing items costing less than $175 from its sales tax year-round. New York has a 4% sales tax rate — which climbs to 8.8% in New York City — but also exempts clothing costing less than $110.
ITEP: Sales tax holidays do little for consumers
Sales tax holidays also are increasingly facing scrutiny for delivering minimal relief.
A family that spends $500 on back-to-school clothes for its children during Connecticut’s promotion would save $31.75.
The Department of Revenue Services estimates the tax holiday will cost the state between $2 million and $3 million.
A $2 million cost represents 1/120th of 1% of the state budget’s General Fund. By comparison, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration estimates Connecticut closed the last fiscal year on June 30 with almost $2.5 billion unspent, which represented almost 11% of the General Fund.
Lamont and the General Assembly in 2023 ordered the first state income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s, boosted a tax credit for the working poor and expanded exemptions for pension and annuity earnings. These changes cost the state close to $500 million annually, but low- and middle-income households benefit between $200 and $400 per year.
“A two- to three-day sales-tax-free shopping spree for selected items does nothing to reduce taxes for low- and moderate-income taxpayers during the other 362 days of the year,” Miles Trinidad, an analyst for the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, wrote in a brief last month.
Most states’ sales tax systems, including Connecticut’s, already are largely regressive, meaning consumers pay the same rate regardless of their income or wealth. And these holidays are too brief to effectively reform this unfair system, Trinidad wrote.
A 2010 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago found that households making less than $30,000 annually generally couldn’t even afford to time their purchases to take advantage of these sales tax promotions. Instead, they had to buy clothes or other basic items only when their resources allowed it.
Some retailers also increase prices to take advantage of the increased customer traffic during a sales tax holiday. A 2003 study of Florida retailers found that up to 20% of the price cuts that consumers thought they were receiving from the tax holiday effectively had been reclaimed by last-minute price hikes.
Fazio: ‘A nice PR stunt’
So why are nearly four out of every 10 states offering sales tax holidays this year?
“Sales tax holidays are politically popular with elected officials because they offer direct discounts, whether real or perceived, to consumers in a highly visible way,” Loughead and Myers wrote.
“Permanent solutions tend to be deprioritized when politically easier, temporary gimmicks like sales tax holidays persist,” wrote researchers for the Tax Foundation. Another Tax Foundation official once told the New York Times these holidays are “political catnip.”
Connecticut’s promotions have long been lauded by politicians here.
“Our annual sales tax holiday gives Connecticut consumers some extra savings during the busy back-to-school retail season,” Lamont said Monday. “I encourage everyone to take advantage of these savings and, as always, support our many locally owned small businesses.”
Promoting the event last year in West Hartford, Lamont said, “This is Christmas in August.”
Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, who is exploring a bid for governor and currently is a ranking Republican on the legislature’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, also backs the sales-tax-free week — but says state officials real focus must be on further, ongoing income tax rate cuts. 
Sales tax holidays are “a nice PR stunt for leadership in state government with the third-highest taxes in the country who have refused to deliver real long term tax relief,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sales-tax-art.jpg,,,2025-08-13 05:57:42.922056

(Photo by Matt Vasilogambros/Stateline.)A pair of Democratic Ohio state lawmakers want to give voters the chance to sign up for absentee ballots permanently. Eight states allow all their citizens to opt in to regular absentee voting, and another 11 allow specific populations like people with disabilities to do so, too.
But under current law in Ohio, voters must file a new absentee ballot request with every single election. And the procedure isn’t all that simple.
Ohioans can register to vote online, but they can’t request an absentee ballot while they’re there. Instead, voters have to print and fill out a request form and then mail it in to their county board.
Ohio state Reps. Michele Grim, D-Toledo, and Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, argue that’s more cumbersome than it needs to be.

How the bill works
Ohio House Bill 400 would create several avenues for voters to sign up for the permanent absentee ballot list.
“Folks who regularly vote by mail can voluntarily opt into being part of a system where they’re always going to get an application to vote by mail,” Rader explained. “So they don’t have to go seek that out every election. They don’t have to go find a form, or go online and request a form and remember to do that, put it on their calendar.”
“So, it just kind of removes a step,” he added, “makes it a little bit easier for folks that prefer to vote by mail.”
The measure directs the Ohio Secretary of State to develop a new form for voters to add their name; voter registration, change of address and change of name forms would all get a new box allowing voter to opt in as well.
Ditto the online voter registration portal. Finally, anytime a voter requests an absentee ballot for an individual election, they could also sign up for absentee ballots going forward.
Rader stressed the program is voluntary. Voters can sign up and back out at will.
Rep. Grim said she regularly hears from voters who don’t realize they have to request an absentee ballot every single time. Primary, special, general — each one requires its own request.
“A lot of a lot of people don’t know that, or they forget sometimes,” Grim said. “So this would make it a lot easier, especially for older folks or people with disabilities, but also, you know, folks that maybe don’t work traditional jobs and have a hard time voting.”
“I actually did it in California, when I lived in California,” she added. “My ballot came every time, and I was able to vote and mail it back. It was very simple, and I think it just helps a lot of people.”
This is not the first time Democrats have proposed a permanent absentee voter list. Former state Rep. Michael Skindell, D-Lakewood, made the most recent attempt in 2022, but that proposal went nowhere.
A likely complaint is what happens when a voter moves or dies? Does the new resident just luck into an extra ballot? The short answer is no.
“That is against the law, so they can’t do that,” Grim said. “If they vote with someone’s ballot, that’s not their name, you know, that is a state and federal offense.”
What’s more, the proposal doesn’t direct county boards to send the actual ballot. Instead, voters would get the ballot request form.
To get an actual ballot the voter has to return that form with identifying information including date of birth, social security number or driver’s license and their signature.
Election officials verify that information on the application form and again when the voter sends in their ballot.
Grim notes it’s not as straightforward as it could be, but it’s an improvement on a system requiring the voter to initiate each absentee ballot request.
Rader also said it would be nice if voters could just sign up to receive a ballot rather than a request form.
“I would love to move to the next step, but I think we have to take this in incremental steps,” he said. “I think our goal here is to get people warmed up to this idea and see if we can’t get bipartisan support.”
Ultimately, Rader said, it would be great if Ohio joined the eight states and Washington, D.C. that proactively mail ballots to every registered voter for every election.
“If we can get more buy in for universal vote by mail would be fantastic,” he said, “but I don’t know if that’s like where our state is right now.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Like people, rivers suffer from lack of care and concern. The 117 miles of the Merrimack River, known colloquially as the “Mighty Merrimack,” generously supply drinking water to over 600,000 residents in Concord, Nashua, Manchester, and Haverhill, Lowell, and Lawrence, Massachusetts. The river rises at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers in Franklin and empties into the Atlantic in Newburyport, Massachusetts. 
But it has suffered for centuries.
Prior to European settlement, Native peoples inhabited its shores — the Agawam and Naumkeag (Nashua), Souhegan and Namoskeag (Manchester), Pennacook (north of Bow), and the Winnepisseogee (Lakes Region) — and named the river Merrimack, meaning dark and deep.
Since last century’s industrial boom, their ancestral waters have been dammed and canalled, resulting in severe degradation. Manchester residents remember as children swimming in water of unusual colors, odors, and vegetation. In the 1960s, the Merrimack was considered one of the 10 most polluted U.S. rivers due to years of unmediated dumping of raw sewage, paper and textile mill discharge, and tannery sludge. 
Environmentalist Donald Eaton Carr described it as “haunted with the oldest and most hopeless pollution of any in the country.”
In 1973, phthalates, a group of chemicals used to manufacture plastics, were identified in high concentrations. In 1976 a study found road salt to be the major polluter. A 1997 study found elevated bacteria counts, low dissolved oxygen, and high nutrient levels. A 2002 water assessment detected elevated E. coli and coliform counts. By the 2020s the biggest concern was pollution from combined sewage overflow.
Wildlife has suffered from the contamination of shellfishing beds and aquatic life from contaminated habitats resulting from excess lead, zinc, and heavy metals, such as mercury, which poses a significant threat to fish. Though the Clean Water Act of 1972 improved the river’s infrastructure with funding for a wastewater treatment plant in Manchester, the Merrimack remains one of the most endangered rivers (named by American Rivers, 2016). 
Current concerns include stormwater runoff, high levels of bacteria, phosphorus creating harmful algal blooms, reduced oxygen levels, illicit sewage, and litter. Due to infrastructure issues in the sewage system, untreated sewage flows directly into the Merrimack during combined sewage overflows.
What a toxic and tragic evaluation for a river honorably named by Chandler Eastman Potter as “the place of strong current” (“merruh” meaning strong and “auke” meaning place) and by Henry David Thoreau as the “Sturgeon River.” 
Fortunately, conservationists are deeply committed to its restoration. 

To protect New Hampshire waterways, the NH Network Plastics Working Group is advocating for a statewide plastic bag ban. 
Neighbors near the treatment plant, with support from the Conservation Law Foundation, are petitioning to reduce and/or eliminate PFAS and other “forever chemicals” contained in the sewage sludge from upstream industries from being burned at high temperatures, contaminating the air, and leaching into groundwater and the river itself. 
The Merrimack Conservation Partnership, a consortium of 30 environmental organizations, is dedicated to protecting the watershed by promoting “advocacy, restoration, outreach, and education.”

The Merrimack’s water has been thoroughly tested and analyzed, but only Rocky Morrison of the Clean River Project has committed to its cleanup. 
Raised on the river, Morrison would fish and canoe often, steering his boat clear of the trash build-up along the sandbars. He was “disgusted,” he said, by the trash along the shoreline, and launched the first Merrimack River Scavenger Hunt with the goal of retrieving as much debris as possible. In 2007, he organized a tire pull-out day, which collected 584 tires and 23 cars.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Ohio LGBTQ+ advocates will soon start collecting signatures for their equal rights proposals as the U.S. Supreme Court has been asked to review its 2015 same-sex marriage decision.
It’s been 10 years since SCOTUS decided in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case originating out of Ohio where justices determined that same-sex couples have the fundamental right to marry. The ruling legalized same-sex marriage across the country.
But the Ohio Constitution still states, “Only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized.”
Ohio amendments for marriage equality and equal rights both cleared for signature collection

This means that if the justices overturn Obergefell, same-sex marriage would be illegal in Ohio once again.

“Some people hear equal rights and think, ‘Well, I already have all my rights. I have what I need,'” Lis Regula with Ohio Equal Rights said. “That’s not necessarily the case for everybody.”

Kim Davis, a former clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for several days in 2015 after denying a same-sex couple their marriage license, asked the high court Monday to take up a case that would overturn that decision.
In 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the Supreme Court of the United States should reconsider landmark cases such as Obergefell.
Regula knows he can’t change what the court will do, he said, but there are other options.
“What Ohioans do have control over is being able to put forward ballot initiatives that help to protect our state, help to protect our community,” he said.
Ohio Equal Rights just got one step closer to enshrining marriage equality into the state constitution.
On Friday, Attorney General Dave Yost certified two separate constitutional amendment proposals: one would remove a provision from the state Constitution that prohibits same-sex marriage, and the other would prohibit discrimination by state and local governments because of “race, color, creed or religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression regardless of sex assigned at birth, pregnancy status, genetic information, disease status, age, disability, recovery status, familial status, ancestry, national origin, or military and veteran status.”
Ohio Equal Rights has been approved to start collecting signatures for the Ohio Right to Marry Amendment, which would remove the provision that bans same-sex marriage, something that Christian conservative activist Lizzie Marbach is prepared to fight.
“It directly goes against our First Amendment right to practice our religion, but also it is spitting in the face of God because not only does he define what marriage is, but he’s who created the sexes,” Marbach said.
Just because someone has an interpretation of the Bible doesn’t mean it applies to everyone, Regula said.
“That’s perfectly fine for her to believe,” Regula said. “But we are not a Christian nation.”
There is a specific carveout for religious organizations and members of clergy who will be able to deny marriage requests, which Marbach appreciated but said wasn’t enough.
She said her faith is why she is also against Ohio Equal Rights’ other ballot proposal, the Ohio Equal Rights Amendment, which would prohibit government discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
10 years after winning marriage equality, Jim Obergefell wants to aim higher

This is just meant to fight against the legislation lawmakers passed last year, she said.
“It’s important not to allow men into women’s bathrooms and boys into young girls’ sports and all of those things,” she said.
Ohio Equal Rights was required to put forward two proposals instead of one that focused on all LGBTQ+ rights. Republicans on the Ohio Ballot Board said that same-sex marriage was fundamentally different than anti-discrimination protections.
This means that instead of only needing to collect about 415,000 signatures for one constitutional amendment, supporters would need to get that amount for each of the two amendments — 830,000 valid signatures. For all ballot proposals, campaigns need valid signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties.
Regula wants to get this on the November 2026 ballot.
“I think being able to pass this would be a huge bright spot,” he said.
Already, GOP politicians, like Sec. of State Frank LaRose, have begun fundraising off of the amendments.
However, LaRose — and each other politician we have seen — have only mentioned the Equal Rights Amendment, not marriage equality.
In a fundraising email, the secretary asked for help to fight the Democrats who are trying to “Enshrine special protections for extreme transgender policies in schools, businesses and even churches.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)Kansans can congratulate themselves. A vacancy on the state Supreme Court has once again been smoothly filled through an orderly process Kansans voted to put into our state constitution in 1958. At its heart, the process requires selection of the court’s justices based on their merit, not politics. As the final step in that process, last week Gov. Laura Kelly appointed attorney Larkin Walsh. She became the 29th justice appointed on merit since Kansans chose it 67 years ago.
I have known Walsh for 15 years. She is an outstanding choice, blessed with experience ranging from working as a research attorney for both the federal court and the Kansas Supreme Court (where I worked with her) to representing clients in complex court cases. She brings with her a strong work ethic and absolute commitment to the rule of law.
It is important to remember how Walsh got here. Along with thousands of other Kansas lawyers and judges, she received notice of a Supreme Court vacancy. In response to this opportunity offered equally to so many, Walsh applied to be a justice — as did 14 others.
The next steps in the selection process were created by the voter-approved constitutional amendments and involve the Supreme Court Nominating Commission. Because an applicant’s merit-based selection as a justice essentially means competition with the other applicants, the commission must thoroughly vet them all.
That commission of nine members from across the state reviewed the applications of Walsh and her 14 competitors, investigated them and interviewed them in full public view. At the end of this step in the selection process, the commission members elected Walsh and two other applicants — both judges — as their nominees. The commission then forwarded these three names to Kelly for making her appointment as the last step of the competitive, merit-based selection process.
After even more vetting and personally interviewing each of the three nominees separately, Kelly eventually selected Walsh as a justice. On merit, not ideology.
I speak from experience. In 2002, I underwent this same process with 17 other applicants. The nominating commission’s work was extensive, even seeking input from people I had not listed on my application.
After my interview with Gov. Bill Graves, I was appointed and served for 17 years on the Supreme Court, including the last 10 as chief justice. Unlike in some other states, I never had to make political speeches, raise any campaign money, or tell anyone (such as voters or potential donors), how I would vote on certain issues as a justice. I certainly was not asked such questions by the nominating commission or Graves.
The ultimate stage in the merit-based selection process is a democratic one — which requires the people of Kansas to have the final word. Starting with the first statewide election after Walsh has served 12 months, Kansas voters will decide whether to retain her to start a six-year term. If she is retained, voters will have the same opportunity every six years after that, much like I faced retention votes in 2004, in 2010 and in 2016. I don’t know how much more democratic you can get.
In the Kansas constitution, the people created a system that has worked well for 67 years to select justices based on their merit. These justices do not serve one party or ideology. Instead, they serve the people of Kansas and the rule of law. Like Larkin Walsh will.
Lawton Nuss served more than 17 years as a justice on the Kansas Supreme Court, including nearly a decade as chief justice.

Unfortunately, inaction by both state and federal lawmakers could quickly make things worse.
In June, the national 2025 KIDS COUNT Data Book, a 50-state report of data developed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, ranked Ohio 31st in America for child well-being. The reasons why weren’t surprising.
The research showed almost one in five Ohio children, about 470,000, live in poverty. That is more people than the populations of either Cincinnati or Cleveland respectively. Almost 70 percent of Ohio eighth graders aren’t proficient in math, while a similar share of fourth graders struggle with reading. Meanwhile, nearly 9 percent of Ohio newborns have a low birthweight, slightly above the national average.
These are just the latest figures in a long downward trend for our state. In 2015, KIDS COUNT ranked Ohio 23rd for child well-being.
So, how could things get worse?
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Well, many more Ohio children now risk losing both health care and access to food after Congress passed the “Big Beautiful Bill.” More than half of Ohio children are enrolled in Medicaid. Some of our state’s own representatives in Washington recently voted to cut that vital program by roughly $1 trillion over the next decade. They also defunded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $186 billion during that same period. The Urban Institute predicts more than 108,000 Ohio families with children could now lose some or all of their SNAP benefits.
In our 2023 Ohio school meals report, we emphasized well-nourished children are healthier and learn better. If we take away meals and health care, we’re not just cutting programs — we’re setting children back.
And yet, when our state’s lawmakers knew these changes were coming from Washington, they made a choice to pass a state budget that included a $1 billion tax cut for the wealthy and money for Cleveland Browns’ ownership. The General Assembly made these choices at the same time it rejected Governor Mike DeWine’s proposal to support Ohio families by creating a child tax credit.
We’re not surprised by the final decisions made by our lawmakers in Columbus. After all, they had been telegraphing their priorities for several months. Still, they had the opportunity to make choices that would benefit children — and they chose not to.
In response, we need to go back to square one. If we want real progress for families then we must secure a vision for Ohio that doesn’t rely on gutting essential services or handing corporations blank checks. That means building grassroots power strong enough to make legislators think first about their constituents, not their campaign donors. When everyday people are organized and unified, they can hold elected officials accountable and create the change families need and deserve.
Whether you live off Lake Erie, Columbus or in rural Southeast Ohio, the challenges facing our children, like poverty and a lack of health care, are shared community issues regardless of political affiliation. It’s important for people from different parts of Ohio with common concerns to come together and show that we all want the best for our children. Building broad-based support for improving the well-being of ALL children is the work that must happen now.
Despite setbacks, we know things can swing in the favor of Ohio’s children when there’s genuine commitment. Ohio’s lawmakers must act now before more children suffer the consequences of continued neglect.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)After a flurry of activity at the state Capitol Tuesday, it’s unclear if lawmakers are any closer to ending the budget impasse that has lasted more than six weeks past the constitutionally mandated June 30 deadline.
With both the Democratic-controlled House and GOP-led Senate holding floor sessions that stretched into the evening, disagreements that had largely been conducted behind closed doors have been dragged into the open. 
On Tuesday, the Senate passed a budget bill that would see the commonwealth spend $47.6 billion in the next year, roughly $3 billion less than a proposal passed in the House last month.
The Senate also passed a Republican-backed plan to fund the state’s mass transit agencies for the next two years, providing about $300 million. The bill would also take money from a fund for public transit to spend on roads and bridges.
Both votes fell on party lines.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I ask my colleagues today, to stand with the taxpayers of this commonwealth, to stand with those that are service providers or educating our children right now who need the money to start flowing, to decide on this side of fiscal stability and not trying to greatly outspend what we’re taking in,” said Senate Appropriations Chair Scott Martin (R-Lancaster)
The move comes only two days before the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA)’s stated deadline to receive new funds from the state, or cut services by 20% later this month.
It’s also a response to a proposal that passed the House on Monday that would give transit agencies an additional 1.75% of the state’s total sales tax collected, which Republicans have called irresponsible.
But despite both chambers in the Capitol individually making progress, leaders in the House and Senate seem as divided as ever.
A  joint statement provided by House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia), House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) and House Appropriations Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia), said the Republicans “failed to do their job.” 
“This budget does not fulfill our constitutional obligation to adequately and equitably fund our public schools and it fails to support critical programs and services such as mass transit,” they added.
Manuel Bonder, a spokesperson for Shapiro, said, “ this is clearly not a serious, long-term proposal that can pass both chambers. It’s time to get back to the table and keep working at it.”
And following passage of the Senate measure, President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) wrote in a post on the social media platform X, “If Gov. Shapiro and House Democrats reject this proposal, holding up funding is on the governor and the House Democrats and they will have to answer to their constituents.”

House Bill 257 would transfer $87.5 million in state gaming revenue to both public transportation and highway funding next year and $43 million annually thereafter. That money could come from skill games – a target for regulation by both Democrats and Republicans. 
Right now, SEPTA and other transit agencies in rural, suburban and urban areas get money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund earmarked separately for operations (referred to as 1513 funds in the measure) and capital (referred to as 1514 funds) expenses.
The bill would allow transportation entities to transfer a limited amount of those capital funds to operations. And it would require fare increases indexed to inflation in 2026, 2027 and then every other year thereafter (leaving open the possibility to seek a waiver).
But Republicans and Democrats disagree over whether that would mean pulling money from improvement and construction projects. While Democrats said that the trust fund money was earmarked, Republicans said they were never offered proof of more than $1 billion or so being dedicated to projects.
The confusion seems to extend to SEPTA’s leadership.

“It’s a solution that essentially tells SEPTA and other transit agencies to raid from our capital dollars to put them into our operating budgets,” Scott Sauer, SEPTA’s general manager, told reporters. “That creates a whole slew of problems for us.”
Later in the evening, Sauer said in a statement sent to the Capital-Star, “In subsequent discussions with Senate Republican staff this evening, there may be confusion about the proposed sources of funding to address the crisis we are facing. As a result, we expect to remain in close contact with all parties in this negotiation as we continue to await a solution that will provide adequate, sustainable funding for SEPTA’s future.”
It’s unclear whether SEPTA would proceed with planned service cuts if this proposal should pass the House before the oft-repeated deadline of Thursday, Aug. 14. The board isn’t scheduled to meet until Aug. 28. 
It also calls for sentencing enhancements for dealing drugs on or near public property related to transportation and making it a felony to interfere with public transit vehicle operators.
And it would make the role of SEPTA special prosecutor with jurisdiction over crimes committed “within” the transit system  – on track to expire in 2026 – more permanent with four-year terms. 
Transit systems serving at least 600,000 people also would have new performance criteria. The only two that meet that requirement are SEPTA and Pittsburgh Regional Transit. 
For highways, funding would be allocated to counties based on eligible mileage and road conditions – and require the work to be completed within five years.

The 37-page transportation funding bill passed Tuesday night started out as a two-page piece of legislation that would ensure the state driver’s license test and education materials cover driving safely in work zones. Those components remain in the legislation.
The bill also takes money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund for road and bridge repair.
“It sounds like it’s a pretty good day for rural Pennsylvania,” Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said. 
Pittman and other Republicans on multiple occasions referenced Gov. Josh Shapiro’s decision to flex $153 million of federal highway funds in November to SEPTA to avoid immediate service cuts and fare increases. 
“Now you know how we felt back in November when the governor absconded $153 million from road projects and put it into transit,” Pittman said. “Now you know how we felt 15 years ago when Governor Rendell took road money and put it in the transit.”
“Doesn’t feel so good, does it?” he added.
A divide over education
Another area where the two proposed budgets diverge is on K-12 education spending.
Last year, both chambers agreed to a new adequacy funding formula, based on factors like poverty in a school district, in response to a 2023 Commonwealth Court ruling that found the state’s public school funding was unconstitutionally inequitable. The result was more than $500 million distributed through the formula explicitly to benefit underfunded school districts.
This year, both Shapiro and House Democrats proposed increasing the amount of education funding by $526 million. The Senate’s proposed budget would keep education funding at the same rate it was set last year.

Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill (R-York), called the proposal “a way forward to ensure that our children returning to their classrooms in a few weeks have the resources that they need in their classrooms.”
She added, “Our students, teachers, administrators and nonprofit staff can know that instead of a fictional world that the Governor thinks that we live in where budgets do not need to balance exist,” 
Democrats, however, argued that failing to increase education funding could amount to the state failing to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Court ruling.
While the ruling called on lawmakers to solve the problem, they pointed to a report from a commission that determined the state would need to spend roughly $5.4 billion to adequately fund all of the state’s schools, and recommended doing so over a seven-year period.
According to Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny), the Republican proposal falls far short, and fails to live up to promises made by lawmakers last year to increase spending to meet that target.
Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia) also said, “it does not fund our schools, it does not address the increases in education funding that have been mandated by the courts. … It is not a real solution.”
PA Schools Work, a coalition of education-focused nonprofits, including some involved in the lawsuit that led to the Commonwealth Court ruling, opposed the flat funding proposal.
“Senate Republicans’ budget proposal isn’t just inadequate – it amounts to a massive education cut that betrays Pennsylvania students and leaves them holding the bag,” said Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, Senior Attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, which was a part of the lawsuit, and is a PA Schools Work partner. “Schools can’t meet rising costs with stagnant, unconstitutional funding, and students are entitled to investment, not teacher layoffs. This bill is a gut punch that shortchanges students and abandons lawmakers’ constitutional duty to ensure a thorough and efficient system of public education for all kids in the Commonwealth.”
However, Sen. Scott  Martin, rejected the idea that it was failing to meet requirements, noting with declining public school enrollment, a flat budget would still meet schools’ needs.
“We’re seeing a tremendous decline in our public K-12 enrollment, and part of that’s our demographic decline,” Martin told reporters after the vote. “Where does that balance out? That’s the never-ending tug of war … to me, we need a much fairer system. It’s going to be changing because our demographics change.”
Budget talks have now reached a potential fork in the road. 
Ultimately, the House will either have to agree to what the Senate passed, or the two parties will have to resume negotiations with Shapiro.
“It’s now incumbent upon us to reject what we have in front of us and get back to the table and put together a strong negotiating team that’s going to allow us the opportunity to find that common ground,” said Costa, pushing for a budget that ultimately spends somewhere between what Senate Republicans and House Democrats have proposed.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/state-capitol-2-august-2025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-13 00:56:36.926049

Kemp and the state’s majority conservative legislature passed a bill that prohibits incarcerated transgender people from receiving access to hormone therapy and other treatments used to address gender dysphoria. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post/Getty Images)This story was originally reported by Candice Norwood of The 19th. Meet Candice and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A group of incarcerated transgender women and men have sued Georgia corrections officials, challenging a new law that prevents them from receiving gender-affirming medical care.
The lawsuit, filed Friday morning, accuses the state of violating the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.
Five transgender plaintiffs — two men and three women — brought the class action on behalf of nearly 300 other people in Georgia state prisons, who argue that the state’s law will have “catastrophic consequences.” In some cases it is forcing trans people who have already received hormone replacement therapy and other services for years to detransition without their consent.
“We are very much in the thick of seeing policies like this be adopted,” said Chinyere Ezie, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which brought the lawsuit with co-counsel Bondurant Mixson & Elmore LLP.
“It’s really unfortunate, I think that it has and will cost people’s lives. I think that the plan is to really just eradicate trans people from public life, to really — contrary to medicine — make the treatment of gender dysphoria a culture war, as opposed to a serious medical need that requires treatment.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIn May, Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed SB 185, a bill passed by the state’s majority conservative legislature that prohibits the use of state funds or resources for surgery, hormone replacement therapy, cosmetic procedures, and other treatments used to address gender dysphoria.
The law states explicitly that incarcerated people may still receive treatments like hormone replacement therapy if they are medically necessary for conditions other than gender dysphoria.
Ezie told The 19th that the bill’s sponsors indicated during hearings that incarcerated trans people would not be allowed to pay for treatment themselves, either. Her team has also heard this from their clients, she said. The 19th reached out to the Georgia Department of Corrections to confirm whether incarcerated trans people can pay for these procedures themselves.
“Senate Bill 185 prohibits the use of state funds or resources for the following treatments for state inmates: A. Sex reassignment surgeries or any other surgical procedures that are performed for the purpose of altering primary or secondary sexual characteristics; B. Hormone replacement therapies; and C. Cosmetic procedures or prosthetics intended to alter the appearance of primary or secondary sexual characteristics,” wrote Joan Heath, the department’s director of communications.
“Thus, the GDC cannot use state resources to transport an offender to be seen by a provider paid for at their own expense, nor allow a provider being paid by an offender to treat such offender at a GDC facility,” she continued.
Consequences
The legal complaint includes details about the plaintiffs, who described the effects of being cut off from their gender-affirming medical care. One trans woman named Fantasia Horton, incarcerated in Phillips State Prison, had been receiving hormone therapy since 2019 but was completely cut off following the law, despite being told that her dosages would gradually decrease before ending, according to the Center.
“Due to Defendants’ policies and actions in terminating her treatment, Ms. Horton is now at grave risk of physical and psychological harm,” the complaint states. “Three years ago, after losing access to hormone therapy for just one week after her prison’s supply of hormone therapy was temporarily depleted, Ms. Horton’s mental health plummeted and her depressive symptoms returned.”
Gender dysphoria is a condition recognized by medical journals and professionals. It is defined as the sense of discomfort or anxiety a person feels when their physical gender feels out of sync with their gender identity. This can lead to long-term mental health effects, including periods of depression and thoughts or acts of self-harm.
Forced detransition due to anti-trans legislation, coupled with the poor conditions and discrimination that incarcerated trans people often experience, can worsen these mental health consequences. From a physical standpoint, doctors recommend that any termination of hormone replacement therapy takes place gradually over three to six months, rather than cold turkey.










Taking away individuals’ access to gender-affirming therapies while in prison constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and increases the likelihood of abuse and detrimental health consequences.


– Jan T. Mooney, psychologist


“Taking away individuals’ access to gender-affirming therapies while in prison constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and increases the likelihood of abuse and detrimental health consequences,” Jan T. Mooney, an Atlanta psychologist, and Mark Spencer, an Atlanta-area internal medicine physician, wrote in an April column about the Georgia bill.
“Abrupt cessation or forced weaning of medically necessary, ongoing treatment is a health risk. Physical effects of hormone withdrawal are accompanied by psychological distress, which may manifest as anxiety, depression, and suicidality,” they continued.
Precedents
The class action comes 10 years after Ezie first sued over another ban on gender-affirming care in Georgia prisons. In that case, Ashley Diamond, a Black transgender woman, sued the Georgia Department of Corrections in 2015 after being held in men’s prisons and denied hormone treatments.
The case drew attention from the U.S. Department of Justice, which said at the time that blanket policies barring hormone therapy violate the Eighth Amendment “because they do not provide for individualized assessment and treatment.”
Diamond won an undisclosed settlement in 2016, and her case prompted policy changes in Georgia meant to facilitate better treatment of incarcerated transgender people. But six years later, Diamond sued again, asserting that the state failed to provide her adequate health care or protect her from sexual assault after a second incarceration. Ultimately, Diamond dropped that lawsuit to protect her mental health, according to her lawyers.
To see the same issues come up again in 2025 feels like being “in a time machine going back in time,” said Ezie, who represented Diamond 10 years ago.
“I think that is a feeling that’s shared by many trans rights activists,” Ezie said. “It feels like, rather than seeing a forward march of progress when it comes to securing basic rights and basic dignity for transgender people, we are now fighting to hold on to very basic legal wins that you know we achieved, at times, decades ago.”
Ezie and the legal team at the Center for Constitutional Rights hope the courts overturn Georgia’s law, as they have in other similar cases. For example, Wisconsin enacted a law in 2005 that barred prison doctors from providing hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgery to incarcerated transgender people in state custody. But a federal court ruled that denying this medical care constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
Another state-level class action in Colorado resulted in a negotiated settlement agreement between the state and the Department of Corrections requiring an overhaul of how it houses incarcerated transgender women and provides medical care to all trans people behind bars.
If the Center for Constitutional Rights is successful in Georgia, Ezie anticipates that there will still be a long road ahead in the effort to challenge anti-trans legislation and policies.
“We’re going to continue to use the courts, we’re going to continue to organize, we’re going to continue to — as we did prior to the passage of this bill — lobby against bills like this that seek to cause so much preventable harm,” she said. “This is why we fight.”

Powelson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/private-water-a-proven-partner-for-cts-future/,"Claiming that government ownership of a water system inherently delivers transparency, accountability and long-term value is simply not supported by actual evidence.","Conversations about the future of water operations in Connecticut paint an incomplete picture, overlooking the significant advantages and proven track record that regulated, private water companies bring to communities, particularly in Connecticut. 
Claiming that government ownership inherently delivers transparency, accountability and long-term value is simply not supported by actual evidence.
Regulated, private water companies operate under a far more rigorous and transparent regulatory framework compared to government-run systems. Regulated, private water companies are subject to oversight from multiple state and federal agencies. In Connecticut, this includes the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA). This multi-layered scrutiny not only leads to higher rates of compliance, it also results in an increased standard of performance in areas such as cybersecurity, diversity and even rates.
Regulated, private water companies’ rates in Connecticut, far from being arbitrary, are meticulously reviewed and authorized by PURA, ensuring fairness and preventing an undue burden on consumers. This level of independent oversight is often less robust in government-run systems, where decisions can be more susceptible to the whims of political influence rather than purely operational or financial considerations.
The claim that regulated, private companies are solely driven by “shareholder profits” and thus neglect long-term planning or affordability is a grossly inaccurate statement. Regulated, private water companies’ business model is built on long-term investment. Our success is inextricably linked to the health of the communities we serve. This necessitates continuous investment in infrastructure, advanced treatment technologies and skilled personnel to ensure the delivery of safe, reliable and high-quality water for generations.
Regulated, private water companies such as Aquarion and Connecticut Water have a long and distinguished history of serving Connecticut residents, because they consistently invest in safety and reliability by updating the community’s infrastructure and delivering water that meets or exceeds all regulatory standards. This commitment to long-term stewardship is a fundamental principle of responsible private utility management.
Furthermore, the notion that regulated, private systems are inherently less compliant is simply not true. While a recent op-ed cites a single study from Virginia, it’s crucial to consider the broader landscape. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), regulated, private water companies are 24% less likely to violate the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The largest and most comprehensive analysis of water quality data ever conducted found that private ownership of a community water system resulted in higher SDWA compliance rates over a 34-year period.
Using Connecticut’s Regional Water Authority (RWA) as an example, the EPA data shows the government-run system was not in compliance with the lead and copper rule for nearly five months in 2021 due to a monitoring and reporting violation. Furthermore, a Safe Drinking Water Act Sanitary Survey conducted in May 2021 found “significant deficiencies” in the RWA system.  Three years later, a SDWA sanitary survey showed RWA had the same “significant deficiencies,” and the list of “recommendations” expanded to also include “distribution” and “security,” indicating negative progress on key performance metrics.
As of June 2025, the EPA Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) Violations Report shows 59 total violations for RWA dating to 2014. Of these violations, 56 are listed as “major violations.” The vast majority – 55 of the 59 – occurred in 2014-2015 as monitoring and reporting violations relating to a variety of contaminants.
The reality is that regulated, private water companies often have access to greater capital, specialized expertise and economies of scale that enable them to invest in cutting-edge technologies and best practices for water treatment and monitoring. This translates into superior water quality and a proactive approach to regulatory compliance. This is a claim that is supported by study-after-study, not just a cherry-picked one from a single state.
The reputation of regulated, private water companies – and indeed their very existence – depends on delivering safe water, making regulatory adherence a top priority, not an afterthought. Connecticut residents have been well-served by regulated, private water companies and their dedicated professional employees and their established infrastructure for decades.
Ultimately, the debate over government-run versus regulated, private ownership should not be about ideology, but about what truly delivers the best outcomes for communities. Regulated, private water companies offer a compelling value proposition: access to capital for critical infrastructure upgrades, specialized expertise in water management, rigorous independent regulatory oversight and a proven commitment to delivering safer, more reliable and affordable water.
For Connecticut, a new, untested government-run entity carries significant risks, including potential service disruptions, increased costs to customers and a loss of the institutional knowledge and expertise that has been cultivated over a long history.

Kennedy Jr. on the ballot last year, I can attest to the absolute ridiculous rules and regulations in Connecticut to unfairly restrict people from getting on the ballot.
The biggest impediment is cost.  While we in Connecticut had hundreds of volunteers willing to “stand out on the pavement,” the nature of the process requires you to collect around 150% of the required signature count due to expected disqualifications.  Why? “Signer didn’t list their correct address; the state can’t read the signer’s printing (they must print themselves); can’t read their birthdate” (yes that’s required); and it goes on.  So because of the sheer signature numbers required, ultimately, you resort to needing to pay for people to help.  
This is clearly intended to take funds away from educating the voters on policies, qualifications, etc.  So, ultimately, it’s a ploy to undemocratically keep people from running.  And it works.
Here’s more, the State of Connecticut absolutely makes it impossible to actually do this job.  Did you know that the state won’t allow you to  petition outside a Division of Motor Vehicles office?  You also cannot petition outside the Post Office.  You cannot petition outside any privately owned business, like grocery stores. (And while this doesn’t sound like a problem, most private businesses won’t allow it because people don’t like to be asked).  So, the state is requiring it, but doing everything possible to make it impossible to accomplish.
This process of antiquated and onerous and I believe undemocratic.  So, for a state that constantly purports to be the bastion of democracy, this is absolutely the opposite of that.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)The New Mexico board overseeing water regulations quashed robust public opposition Tuesday  seeking to stop a proposal that would allow much wider use of oil and gas wastewater that environmental advocates say could contaminate the state’s limited supply of drinking water.
Dozens of people spoke during a three-hour public comment period that drew over 100 attendees to the Water Quality Control Commission Meeting at the Roundhouse. Most objected to the renewed effort to change rules about disposal of wastewater, a potentially toxic byproduct of oil and gas extraction. State law currently limits disposal to oilfields and recently extended disposal in concrete pits for pilot projects to test treatment technologies.
Opponents included conservation nonprofits such as Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter, Amigos Bravos, Western Environmental Law Center, among others; members from acequias and several health care workers. Sen. Harold Pope presented a letter from 25 Democratic lawmakers, urging the commission to keep the current rule in place.
“Reopening this issue undermines the Democratic process and disrespects the public’s investment of time and trust,” said Pope, a Democrat from Albuquerque. “There has been no new, no new peer-reviewed, published scientific evidence presented.”
Proponents for the changes say allowing the byproduct – also known as produced water – to be used for more industrial, construction and agricultural purposes would mean less tapping into fresh sources used for drinking.
An industry group known as WATR, which stands for Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse (WATR) Alliance, with board members from oil and gas giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum and other industry interests, put forward the new proposal in June, just a month after the state water commission adopted rules to allow for pilot projects, but no discharges into surface or groundwater.
WATR’s proposed rule would allow 13 counties to use the treated produced water for uses such as watering livestock, “non-food crops,” construction and release into the environment.

“I think that this commission should hear from the communities where the water’s being produced, from the communities who see the water being transported to Texas every day,” Jennifer Bradfute, an attorney for WATR Alliance told commissioners Tuesday. “They see and witness the missed opportunity for New Mexicans to treat and use that water in their own projects, for their own economic development.”
The 12-member board rejected three motions from environmental groups Tuesday to toss WATR’s proposal altogether or to request additional time to prepare for a future hearing. The board’s vote Tuesday means the proposal to expand use of oil and gas wastewater will be considered at a hearing tentatively scheduled for November.
Attorneys for New Mexico environment and conservation groups called Tuesday’s vote a “travesty” and “disappointment,” saying they’d seek further legal options.
“They completely shut the public out of the process today,” Mariel Nanasi, executive director and attorney at nonprofit New Energy Economy, told Source New Mexico after the hearing.
“As young people, we’re extremely disappointed that the Commission chose to side with polluters,” said Vittoria Judy with Youth United for Climate Crisis Action in a statement after the meeting. “The industry’s toxic waste crisis is not our problem to solve, and if regulators won’t protect us, we’ll keep fighting to defend our water and our future.”
It’s the latest development in a tense policy debate to address New Mexico’s water scarcity driven by climate change, clashing with oil and gas and the industry’s political influence in New Mexico.
The New Mexico oil and gas industry generates billions of gallons of wastewater. The mixture is extremely salty and poses challenges for treatment since it can contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, toxic chemicals and cancer-causing compounds from the oil and gas, such as benzene. Oil and gas companies can use compounds protected as trade secrets in the mixture, which do not have to be disclosed to regulators or the public.
Powerful proponents for treating the water include Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), chair of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee.
“Setting standards for reusing treated wastewater would create the regulatory pathway to offset industrial demand for freshwater while protecting our families, farmers and communities,” Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a written statement. “The governor supports the Water Quality Control Commission considering the reuse petition and reaching a decision based on thorough review of all scientific data and expert testimony presented by the parties.”

Snow melts, drought builds and NM legislators spike new oil regulations


Water Commissioner Bill Brancard, who said he opposed WATR’s proposal, warned their attorneys to limit the scope of the changes, saying that they’ll be “raked over the coals” in the upcoming public hearing for the broad proposed uses.
“It was never in the intent of the commission when we passed the last set of regulations to go from nothing to 60 in two seconds,” he said during Tuesday’ hearing. “The goal was incremental changes built on what the commission has built. Instead, you’re proposing to completely repeal the entire effort of the commission and do something that nobody considered from the beginning.”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderPublic health workers and gun safety advocates gathered at a rally Tuesday night to commemorate last week’s deadly shooting near Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and demand policy changes to prevent future instances of gun violence.
At the entrance to the CDC, members of the community piled flowers, balloons and stuffed animals alongside signs thanking CDC workers and DeKalb County police Officer David Rose, who was killed in the shooting.
Down the street at Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health, leading voices in epidemiology, pediatric health and violence prevention took the stage in a packed auditorium to describe what they saw as a “culture of misinformation” that contributed to Friday’s attack. The rally was organized by Georgia Majority for Gun Safety and Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety.

“Georgia is among the bottom third of state gun violence rates in a country that is doing poorly across developed nations,” said Heather Hallett, the founder and director of Georgia Majority for Gun Safety. “So we are really in a unique position in terms of the way gun violence impacts us.”
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said he was “deeply saddened” by the shooting, and visited the CDC campus Monday to meet with agency leadership and survey the damage.
“We are actively supporting CDC staff on the ground and across the agency,” he wrote in a post on X, adding “We honor their service. We stand with them. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.”
But public health advocates — including former employees of the CDC — point to a rise in public mistrust of vaccines they say is fueled by Kennedy’s rhetoric and policy decisions on vaccines. Earlier this year, he dismissed all 17 members of a key vaccine panel at the CDC and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics. The panel later voted to ban thimerosal, a harmless preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, in what critics say is a nod to vaccine skeptics who have fixated on the chemical’s use. 
Last week, Kennedy also terminated 22 grants — including one at Emory University — as part of a “coordinated wind-down” of research studying mRNA vaccine technology. Vaccines using mRNA were first developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the technology won a Nobel Prize in 2023.
  Dr. Ben Lopman, an epidemiologist and former CDC employee who studies vaccines, spoke at Tuesday’s rally at Emory University. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Dr. Ben Lopman, an epidemiologist and former CDC employee who studies vaccines, said at Tuesday’s rally that misinformation about vaccines “has reached the highest levels in our government and society” under the current administration.
“RFK Jr. was arguably the nation’s leading anti-vaccine activist before being elevated to HHS secretary,” Lopman said. “These wrong ideas are now embedded in everyday conversations, as well as official policy.”
Dr. Sofia Chaudhary, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and an assistant professor at Emory University, also drew a link between mistrust of public health workers and Friday’s attack on the CDC.

“This past Friday, more than 180 bullets were fired, but the attack on public health went beyond the gunfire,” Chaudhary said. “Misinformation is a serious and growing threat to public health that leads to erosion of trust, delays in care and vaccinations, and deepening of social division.”
Speakers at the rally also condemned inaction on gun safety legislation at Georgia’s state Capitol. During the 2025 legislative session, legislators introduced a number of bills aimed at improving gun safety, but did not  pass any of them before the session concluded. Lawmakers will return to Atlanta in January. 
“There are over a dozen bills held in limbo in committee at our state Capitol that use evidence-based solutions to address gun violence,” said Mike Greenwald, a doctor and co-chair of Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety. 
Lawmakers “are aware of the evidence and the arguments,” he added. “What holds them back is likely a political calculus.”
Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety and Georgia Majority for Gun Safety will be launching a new public information campaign on gun safety next month, Greenwald said.



GBI releases updates in ongoing investigation
At a Tuesday news conference, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation released new insights into the motives of 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, a Kennesaw resident who police say is the suspect in the shooting.
Police said nearly 200 rounds of ammunition struck six separate CDC buildings over the course of the attack, and they recovered 500 shell casings from the CVS Pharmacy where White’s body was found dead with what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. White had broken into his father’s safe and stolen five firearms that were used in the attack, including a rifle, a shotgun and a handgun, police said.
  Patrick Joseph White’s driver’s license photo was released Tuesday by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
“All indications in our investigation was that [the guns] were secure and that he forced his way into the safe that contained the weapons,” said GBI Director Chris Hosey.
For the first time, officers publicly confirmed that White had expressed “discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations.” Reporting from the New York Times and CNN alleged that the shooter blamed his health issues on the COVID-19 vaccine, but police had not publicly confirmed the shooter’s motivation before Tuesday.
GBI also released White’s driver’s license photograph for the first time Tuesday.

(Courtesy photo)Xp Lee, who was born in a refugee camp in Thailand after his family fled Laos amid the Vietnam War, won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor special primary election on Tuesday to replace the late Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was killed in an apparent political assassination.
He’ll face Republican Ruth Bittner on Sept. 16, though the solidly blue district will likely deliver a Lee victory and bring the Minnesota House back into a 67-67 tie.
Lee is a health equity analyst for the Minnesota Department of Health and served on the Brooklyn Park City Council from 2022 to 2024. He previously won the DFL party endorsement in District 34B.
Lee told the Reformer last month that he’ll focus on health care and education, including the wide disparties in both — Minnesotans’ health and education outcomes are significantly impacted by the zip codes where they live and were raised.
Lee also said he lives not too far from the home of Melissa and Mark Hortman, who were killed by a gunman on June 14.
”We’ve just had a lot of conversations with neighbors and other residents close by — remembering her and just really feeling about what we can do to move forward. And part of this is also, of course, to take up her legacy at the Capitol,” Lee said.
Until the special election, the vacant seat will be one of three left empty in the Minnesota Legislature following the resignation of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, and the death of Sen. Bruce Anderson, R-Buffalo.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Rental options continue to be widely unaffordable for most low-income workers in Maryland, where a renter needs to make more than twice the minimum wage to afford a one-bedroom apartment, according to a new report.
The 2025 edition of the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s “Out of Reach” report says that a worker earning Maryland’s minimum wage of $15 an hour would need to work 89 hours a week in order to afford a one-bedroom rental home in the state and still have money for other living expenses.
This is the second year that the coalition ranked Maryland as the eighth-most difficult state for low-income renters to afford.
Claudia Wilson Randall, executive director of the Community Development Network of Maryland, said she’s “disappointed” in the lack of movement.
“We have not made much progress in the state of Maryland and housing,” she said.
The report, released Monday, shows that Marylanders working 40 hours a week would have needed to earn $39.15 an hour to be able to afford a two-bedroom apartment in fiscal 2025. That salary, which the report calls a “housing wage,” covers the average fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment at $2,036 without having to sacrifice more than 30% of income on housing,
That means a Maryland household must earn at least $6,786 a month, or $81,434 annually, to afford a two-bedroom apartment. That’s up from the fiscal 2024 housing wage of $36.70 an hour, or $76,345 a year, to afford that two-bedroom.
State officials launch 10-year plan to boost supports for growing senior population

The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Maryland has also increased in the last year, from $1,909 a month in fiscal 2024 to $2,036 a month in fiscal 2025, according to the report.
Renters make up 33% of all households in Maryland, with about 760,800 renters across the state. The report shows that the average Maryland renter has a wage of $22.31, well below the “housing wage” to afford a two-bedroom apartment, according to the report.
Maryland falls behind neighboring Washington, D.C., which ranks fifth for unaffordability with a $44.50 housing wage for two-bedroom apartments. California leads the country with a $49.61 two-bedroom housing wage.
Wilson said that there are several reasons why Marylanders are struggling to afford rental units in the state – it’s not just rent going up and wages stagnating, though those are factors.
“Landlord costs are going up. Cost of insurance is going up … it’s utilities,” she said. “Inflation is also real. That’s just a hard place for renters to be.”
Wilson noted that high rent falls particularly hard on health care workers and other low-paid professions. Nursing assistants, home health and personal care aids, construction workers, cashiers and truck drivers, all have average wages that fall below the “housing wage” of $33.24 to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Maryland.
Kevin Lindamood, president and CEO of Health Care for the Homeless, agrees that the high cost of rent impacts many in the health care sector.
“The high cost of housing continues to be one of the biggest issues facing Maryland families, including the very health care workers we all rely on when we’re sick – like the workforce employed by community health centers like ours,” he said in a written statement.

Wilson said that while the issue of renter affordability is complex, the state can start by prioritizing the development of new homes across the state to help fill a 96,000-unit housing shortage.
“Maryland needs to make progress in the production of housing,” she said. “We also need to create more opportunities for affordable homeownership,” she said. “Again, it’s not a simple problem with one simple answer, but we have to make progress.”
State leaders are already aware of the state’s significant housing shortage, particularly for those earning lower wages.
In 2023, Gov. Wes Moore pushed a housing package to increase the supply of affordable housing options in the state. He attempted to build off of that momentum in the 2025 session by pushing a bill to tie new housing development to areas with high job growth, but those efforts were unsuccessful.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC01954-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 22:57:01.947152

Ford/Maryland Matters)She’s only seven months into the job, but U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md). has been tapped to help lead the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual conference next month in Washington, D.C.
Alsobrooks will join four-term Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) as co-chair of the Sept. 24-28 legislative conference with the theme, “Made for This Moment: Power, Policy, and Progress.” Thousands of elected officials, community leaders and activists are expected to converge on the Walter E. Washington Convention Center for sessions on health, education, economic prosperity and more.
There are a record 62 caucus members in this Congress, representing most of the 67 Black legislators on Capitol Hill. The other five are Republicans who do not belong to the caucus: Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida, Wesley Hunt of Texas, John James of Michigan and Burgess Owens of Utah
Alsobrooks made history in January when she was sworn in with fellow freshman Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), the first time two Black women had been elected to the Senate at the same time.
Neguse, first elected in 2018, has risen in House Democratic leadership ranks, serving as an impeachment manager in 2021 in the second impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. He was elected last year as the assistant Democratic leader and in January he was elected ranking member of House Natural Resources’ Subcommittee on Federal Lands.
“We are in a defining moment for Black America — one where our collective power, civic engagement and policy influence are shaping the future of this nation,” Nicole Austin-Hillery, president and CEO of the foundation, said in a statement. “With leaders like Senator Alsobrooks and Congressman Neguse helping guide this year’s conference, we are poised to deliver one of the most impactful gatherings to date.”

Signature events at the conference include a national town hall, a prayer breakfast and the Phoenix Awards Dinner, which was headlined last year by former Vice President Kamala Harris, then the Democrats’ presidential nominee.
The caucus’ main goal: Amplify voices and issues that most affect the Black community. Rep. Terri A. Sewell (D-Ala.), chair of the foundation’s board of directors, called it “a vital opportunity to come together, share ideas, and shape policies that move our communities forward.”
“By gathering leaders, advocates, and innovators from across the nation, we spark conversations and actions that advance equity, celebrate our culture, and strengthen Black leadership for generations to come,” Sewell said.
List of Annapolis City Council hopefuls set — and it’s a long one
The Annapolis Board of Supervisors of Elections has certified 21 city council candidates, and 16 of them showed up at First Baptist Church of Annapolis for a candidate forum Tuesday, a little more than a month before the Sept. 16 primary.
The two-hour forum was hosted by the Caucus of African American Leaders. Candidates in Wards 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 participated in the forum.
Ward 1 Alderman Harry Huntley (D) is seeking reelection but faces challenges from Democrats Ben Bramsen, Ron Gunzburger, Kathleen McDermott and Genevieve Torri. The nominee will face unaffiliated candidate Thomas Kriek in the Nov. 4 general election.
After the candidates introductory remarks, each was asked about plans to redevelop the City Dock, and what their criteria would be for a proposal to allow certain structures on Dock Street to exceed a height limit by 7 feet. All the candidates said they want to preserve the historic downtown area, with several saying they don’t support “spot zoning.”
Torri said she didn’t like “the culture that we’re hearing tonight, how it’s residents versus businesses, and businesses are bad, and residents may be mad.”
“I don’t think that benefits our city at all,” she said. “We are all a community. We all need to work together, and we need to find the solutions.”
Candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would retain Annapolis Police Chief Edward Jackson, who got a vote of confidence from the caucus last year. About five candidates raised their hands. Gunzburger, who wanted to respond to the question about the chief but wasn’t allowed due to time constraints, quickly said, “I support the men and women of the rank and file.”
All candidates were asked the police chief question, but other questions were more random, ranging from financial literacy programs to affordable housing and efforts to support minority businesses.

Ward 2 Alderwoman Karma O’Neill (D) doesn’t have a primary opponent, but will face Republican Kenneth Vincent in the general election.
The Ward 3 seat is open, after incumbent Rhonda Pindell Charles decision to run for mayor to replace Mayor Gavin Buckley (D) who is term-limited. Democrats Deborah “Debbie” Odum and Keanuú Smith-Brown will square off in the primary, with winner to face unaffiliated voter Mike Dye in the general election for the Ward 3 seat.
The Ward 4 seat is also open, after Alderman Sheila M. Finlayson’s (D) decision not to seek reelection. The Democratic primary between Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson and Coren Makell — there is currently no opponent filed in the general election. Makell attended Tuesday’s forum.
In Ward 6, Democrats Diesha Contee and Craig Cussimanio square off in the primary for the chance to face Republican George Gallagher in the race to succeed Alderman DeJuan Gay, who is not running for reelection. Gallagher did not  participate in Tuesday’s forum.
One more open seat — Ward 8 Alderman Ross H. Arnett III is not seeking reelection — drew Democrat Frank Thorp ad unaffiliated voter Will Cunha, who fill face each other in the general election.
Candidate for Wards 5 and 7 did not attend the forum. Ward 5 Alderman Brooks Schandelmeier will face Republican Jack Papaleonti in the general election, and Ward 7 Alderman Robert Savidge is running unopposed.
Before the forum ended, Carl Snowden, convener of the caucus, announced a mayoral debate will take place at 6:30 p.m. Sept. 10, at the Boys and Girls Club of Annapolis. Besides Pindell Charles, Democrat Jared Littmann and Republican Robert O’Shea are scheduled to participate in that event.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Angela-Alsobrooks-9-13-2024-cropped-e1755058569368-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-13 04:57:02.994532

Myrex campaigned on listening to constituents, improving mental health care in public schools and economic growth. Voters told Myrex they were concerned about a new state law that would allow the city of Cullman, a wet city, to annex land from Cullman County, a dry county, for a “community development project” to serve alcohol.
The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 11 election, scheduled for Aug. 26. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. Myrex supports the repeal bill, which would not go into effect until it goes through the legislature in January.
According to campaign finance records, Myrex raised $151,235.69 and spent $120,132.59. Most of Myrex’s fundraising came from her own money and businesses. Hollingsworth raised $182,878.34 and spent $164,728.51. Almost two thirds of his donations came from political action committees (PACs), where the SV&B and SVBII PACs donated the most at $14,000 between two separate PACs that are operated by the same consulting firm: Swatek, Vaughn and Bryan.

Aug. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A new state commission charged with reviewing and suggesting updates to how Nebraska funds its public K-12 schools kicked off its first meeting Monday largely with a consensus that the state should dole out more aid to local schools.
The work of the new School Financing Review Commission revolves around property taxes and state income and sales tax dollars distributed under Nebraska’s Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act, better known as TEEOSA or state aid formula. The  formula, at a basic view, considers a district’s “needs” minus its “resources.” A district receives “equalization aid” if it has a positive balance.
  Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, center, addresses the new School Financing Review Commission during its first meeting. Aug. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
For the 2025-26 school year, TEEOSA is calculated between 18 “needs,” such as addressing student growth, poverty or English language learners, and six “resources,” including some income tax funds in a given district and how much a district could collect if it taxed the property within its boundaries at $1.
While all schools receive some level of state funding, only 50 of the state’s 245 school districts are equalized, a calculation that fluctuates annually in part because of property valuations.
Gov. Jim Pillen, addressing the commission Tuesday, asked that commissioners leave any preconceived ideas behind and look at what’s best for Nebraska and its schools.
“It’s critical, we all agree, you never, ever, give up on a kid,” Pillen said. “Can’t let one be left behind.”
Brady Public Schools Superintendent Ann Foster, one of 17 members of the mostly governor-appointed commission, which still has one vacancy still to fill, said she recognizes the work is twofold: property tax relief while keeping kids at the “heart” of all decisions.
TEEOSA basics
Local school property taxes accounted for about $2.9 billion of a $5.3 billion total in property taxes collected statewide last year. Schools receive about $5 billion in total revenue each year, including federal and general state aid plus state dollars meant to offset some local property taxes through tax credits. 
Voters prohibited the state from levying separate property taxes in 1966.

Pillen and state lawmakers took a first stab at addressing TEEOSA after he took office in 2023 by establishing baseline “foundation aid” for each district — $1,500 for K-12 students plus $900 for pre-K students.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, one of 18 commissioners and vice chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, passed the legislation this spring establishing the new financing commission to suggest possible tweaks to TEEOSA. The formula has been perennially updated since its creation in 1990.
A lawmaker-led committee thought up TEEOSA and a similar school financing review commission took effect after it passed. That group disbanded in 2002.
State law requires the new commission to produce a first report of recommendations by Dec. 1, with most commissioners saying they want to meet at least monthly until then.
‘Overreliance’ on property taxes
During Tuesday’s meeting, the commission broke into small groups to think up goals for the commission — with agreement there must be a balance among revenue sources, including as funding variables change.

In large part, commissioners said they want to get away from an “overreliance” on property taxes.
Millard Public Schools Superintendent John Schwartz said his group wanted to highlight sustainability and predictability for school districts, the state and taxpayers. But he said doing so should not erode intended property tax relief efforts, which his group said “might add value.”
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, suggested educating the public about TEEOSA could be a good focus, too. Schwartz and former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area agreed. Linehan chaired the Legislature’s Revenue Committee for six years.
“If it was simpler, I think, and people understood it better, school funding would even have more support than it does now,” Murman said.
Operational expenses
Other commissioners, such as Hughes and Nebraska State Treasurer Tom Briese, suggested long-term plans that would have the state assume greater responsibility for school funding.

Hughes, vice chair of the Education Committee, highlighted a long-term goal to push school property tax rates closer together, which vary between 30 cents and $1.05 per $100 of property valuations. Her original bill in the spring, which included the commission, also sought to do this. 
However, Hughes’ original plan, which had earned the backing of Pillen and many school and ag advocates, needed about $120 million in state funding to work. 
That remained out of reach with current tax revenues, as the state continues to face budget woes and as lawmakers reject suggestions to add sales taxes to goods and services currently exempt from them or to increase taxes on tobacco or vape products.
Briese again suggested the state take on the operational expenses of local schools, 80% of which are staff salaries and benefits, an idea Briese, Pillen and other lawmakers tried to rally behind in summer 2024.

That model would be similar to the state assuming the property tax side of community college through 2023 legislation led by Briese and Murman. That law allows community colleges to go back to property taxes if state funding from mostly sales and income taxes falls.
“It’s aspirational at this point,” Briese said. “It’s going to be hard to get there any time real soon, but I think we ought to work through that, figure out how we can do that and try to set ourselves on a roadmap to do that.”
Some school officials and lawmakers have balked at the idea of the state taking on a greater portion of state aid instead of property taxes, arguing it could erode “local control” and lead to more strings, an idea that resurfaced Tuesday and will likely continue to be a focal point.
However, sometimes the same public school defenders have criticized the state for not funding schools to a higher degree.
Operational expenses
Keith Runge, president of the Lakeview Community School Board in Columbus, explained that the state taking on more school funding can be a scary proposition.
Today, the situation could be alright, Runge explained, but in three or four years, he asked if some state lawmakers or officials would try to “tie the hands” of local schools and say, “You either do it this way or you’re going to lose some of this.”

Omaha Public Schools, the largest in the state, has taken a blanket position of opposing any legislation that would increase the district’s reliance on state funding or lead to the “erosion” of local control in budgeting decisions, such as teacher recruitment. OPS board members voted 7-0 for the position in July 2024, earning the ire of some lawmakers, including Linehan
Linehan last summer proposed legislation to remove the “resources” side of the TEEOSA equation. She then suggested using TEEOSA as the vehicle to distribute more school funding.
Shavonna Holman, an OPS board member representing the district on the commission, declined to comment on the district’s position. She was one of the seven voting for it, as did now-State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, who sits on the Education Committee. OPS communications staff confirmed Tuesday that the district’s position has not changed.
Defining ‘local control’
State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, who serves on the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, pushed back. He said school districts already get state money and that the state already has the power and leverage to exert itself more aggressively if lawmakers or the executive branch want to.
“I hear this sometimes, and I’m interested in understanding more about where some of these fears are and what really are we talking about looking forward, if you wouldn’t mind just indulging me a little bit,” Bostar said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Foster gave the example of “autonomy” in teacher recruitment and retention, such as in setting salaries according to the cost of living in Brady, a town of 400, or offering full family insurance. She suggested the commission define what “local control” means to help frame future conversations.
Schwartz said it’s also hard for the state to account for all variables in funding. He said local funding also means a higher degree of local accountability.
“At the point at which a standardized funding formula is put in place, there could be some discrepancies that are maintained indefinitely,” Schwartz said.
Linehan said new legislation for K-12 schools could include similar built-in safety rails as community colleges, for schools to retain the ability to raise property taxes if the state doesn’t fulfill its part of the deal. She and others echoed past statements that school boards would retain local decisions on how to use funding.
Bostar said interests wanting to micromanage schools will exist regardless of funding decisions, as he asked school officials not to “fear” the idea of receiving more state dollars.
“I don’t think your concern about the erosion of local control is misplaced, but I don’t think you should pair that concern with funding,” Bostar told fellow commissioners. “I think that concern should be real, and it exists, but it doesn’t necessarily mean anything related to funding.”
Vice chair decision
The commission’s decision on whom to elect vice chair could hint at what direction the commission goes next in its advisory role. That person would serve alongside Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher, whom lawmakers designated as chair when they created the commission.

Linehan nominated Briese, describing him as someone ag leaders trust. She also noted Briese’s law degree and willingness to consider other taxes to fund schools since at least 2017, when they both joined the Legislature. He became treasurer in 2023.
Ag interests, a predominant Nebraska industry, often feature in property tax debates and can determine the fate of such legislation. Just days before the 2024 summer special session ended last August, tensions erupted, with Linehan warning ag leaders they had major wins in her eight years but still needed to broaden their coalition, such as with homeowners.
Superintendent Aaron Plas of Bennington Public Schools nominated Schwartz, praising his experience in Nebraska schools, big and small. Plas said Schwartz, the most recent Nebraska superintendent of the year, also knows TEEOSA “forwards and backwards.”
Schwartz was selected as vice chair in a 7-5 vote. Two members were absent, and one vacancy remains for an active public school teacher to be appointed by the governor.
‘You’re on the right track’
One member of the public, Dave Welsch, a retired farmer who is president of the Milford School Board, urged the commission to consider aspirations to make Nebraska’s tax policies competitive. While that might often focus on competition with other states, he said it could also include district-to-district tax rates.

One farmer, for instance, might need to sell a bushel of beans for $1 more just to pay for more property taxes, Welsch explained.
The school board president has worked with lawmakers for years on school funding legislation, including Hughes. Welsch said that once schools are equalized, the focus can turn to student investments.
“You’re on the right track,” Welsch told the commission. “Keep rolling.”
Maher, a former central Nebraska superintendent, told reporters he is hopeful for progress. He said nobody in the room voiced a desire to balance budgets on the backs of K-12 schools. Rather, he said the focus is on adequate school funding and supporting students and taxpayers.
Said Maher: “I think if we all put our hearts and minds together, I think we can actually make some progress on the complexity that is school funding.”

We are joining the growing number of communities across the US that are exploring ways to handle calls for help other than by sending police officers.  
The post In Lynn, new ‘Calm Team’ offers  alternative to police response appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MORE THAN 200 years ago, the City of Lynn saw a need to be filled, and founded the Lynn Fire Department in response. The Lynn Police Department, as we know it today, started about 150 years ago. If the city’s newly launched “Calm Team” lives up to our hopes, Lynn will look back to this moment for many years to come as the launch of a similarly vital public safety initiative. 
We have long asked police to respond to almost every kind of trouble imaginable. Whether a violent incident is taking place or a person with known mental illness is in the throes of an acute episode, the way to beckon help has been to dial 911 for police.  
Recognizing that there are situations where a different type of response could be the best way to deal with a situation, a growing number of communities across the US are exploring ways to handle calls for help other than by sending police officers.  
The Calm Team is Lynn’s unarmed alternative to police response. It’s a mobile team of social service professionals with strong community ties who will be charged with responding to some of our residents’ most challenging and sensitive issues in real time.

The number to call Lynn’s newly formed unarmed response team (781-905-CALM) went live on July 21. The Lynn Calm Team is a city service independent of the police department. Originally called for by community activists who part of the Lynn Racial Justice Coalition in response to George Floyd’s murder in Minnesota in 2020, this initiative has been years in the making. 
Understanding there is a critical need to address mental health at the intersection of racial justice and through culturally responsive services, our administration has sought to meet these new challenges in a way that complements and enhances our existing public safety infrastructure. 
This is something that is being implemented in communities across the country, from an experiment going back to the 1980s in Eugene, Oregon, to more recent initiatives in bigger cities like Denver and efforts closer to home in Amherst and Worcester. 
We have contracted with a Massachusetts-based behavioral health provider, Eliot Community Human Services, to hire the core team members and triage calls to leverage Eliot’s expertise and facilitate access to Eliot’s deep pool of behavioral health resources, including the state-funded Community Behavioral Health Center. The core team’s work will be supported by a full-time program administrator in the city’s public health department, who has a background in public administration and conflict resolution, as well as the city’s opioid specialist. 
The Calm Team is an important example of the broader effort to bring all relevant skills and experiences to our critical problems, particularly mental health and substance use, in a way that honors the impact of civil rights activism after George Floyd.  
It will help us reconcile community members’ demands to address individual suffering and law enforcement’s recognition of its own limitations when it comes to dealing with mental and behavioral health issues. Having more options for interventions creates more scenarios where community members have a choice when calling for a response to an individual they see struggling. 
Given the passion around these issues, the development of this team has been controversial. At certain points, advocates felt we were moving too slowly. Other times we were accused of not going far enough. Constituents across the political spectrum questioned our actions, doubted the need for any kind of alternative, and criticized us for putting city resources towards the initiative. 
Convinced that this was the right thing to do, we listened to everyone and worked through every controversy with community engagement. We hosted a series of forums in English and Spanish to educate Lynn residents on these new resources we hoped to make available. We negotiated with our public safety unions to make sure they understood what we were trying to do and could get on board. 
Through community guidance, we arrived at a vetted list of calls to which the Lynn Calm Team will respond. Those issues include non-emergency, non-violent mental health crises, drug overdose follow-up, tenant rights, community mediation, panhandling, and at-risk youth support.  
Recognizing the limitations of unarmed, alternative response, the issues do not include calls that require an immediate medical response, or are considered an active threat, such as domestic violence. The Calm Team members will use their discretion to deescalate situations, but will prioritize the well-being of the people they are trying to help as well as their own safety. 
The work will sometimes overlap with existing public safety teams, and that is OK. These issues are so extensive and, in some cases, intractable, that what works for one individual or situation may not for another. Although the program is independent from existing public safety agencies, collaboration with police and fire will be key to its long-term success.  
Today our cities and towns face new challenges. From creating resilience in the face of climate change, to working to be a community that welcomes everyone, Lynn is not unique. But the new effort with the Calm Team is a clear example of our ability to meet every challenge with an innovative perspective and a commitment to bringing people together. 
The Lynn Calm Team’s name invokes the feeling it hopes to create and was selected in part for its simple translation into Spanish: calma, calmness, tranquility. We hope that in the coming months, we are able to restore some of that calm to our community in a time when it is needed most.  
Jared Nicholson is mayor of Lynn.

,California,2025-08-13 01:12:53+00:00,CalMatters,Federal judge orders Trump administration to restore hundreds of UCLA research grants,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/08/trump-ucla-research-grants/,The administration terminated the grants over alleged DEI violations. University of California attorneys argued the suspensions were arbitrary and capricious.,"In summary
The administration terminated the grants over alleged DEI violations. University of California attorneys argued the suspensions were arbitrary and capricious.


A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore a portion of the 800 federal science research grants that it suspended at UCLA last month, delivering a major setback to efforts to force the university into a $1 billion settlement. 
California district court judge Rita F. Lin ruled Tuesday that the suspensions violated her June  preliminary injunction in which she ordered the National Science Foundation to restore 114 grants it had terminated at the University of California and blocked the agency from cancelling other grants at the UC system.
”NSF’s actions violate the Preliminary Injunction,” Lin wrote.
Her June order came after lawyers for University of California researchers argued the science foundation grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious and in violation of federal law. Those grants and others were terminated over alleged Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion violations following several Trump executive orders in January.
Lin’s order to restore the suspended grants came in response to a court filing lawyers for the UC researchers submitted after 300 National Science Foundation Grants and 500 National Institutes of Health grants at UCLA were suspended. The suspensions froze $584 million. The lawyers aren’t acting on behalf of the UC system, though some are employed at the UC. It is not yet clear if all 300 suspended National Science Foundation grants are to be restored under Lin’s latest order. A lawyer for the researchers, Claudia Polsky, said all 300 should be restored.
Lin told the Trump administration and lawyers for the UC researchers to file an update on the restorations Aug. 19.
Lin’s latest order doesn’t restore UCLA’s suspended National Institutes of Science grants because they weren’t covered in her initial June order.Campuses rely on the funding to make scientific breakthroughs, develop new medicines, train graduate students and fuel the research that has made the U.S. arguably the world’s leader in scientific discovery.
Lawyers for the federal government contended that suspending the UCLA grants didn’t violate Lin’s June order, which barred terminations but was silent on suspensions. Lawyers for the University of California researchers said there’s no difference between suspensions and terminations because both mean researchers lose access to funding. They also argued that like in the June case, the suspensions of UCLA grants didn’t follow federal procedure that requires an agency to explain why each individual grant should no longer continue to receive funding.“NSF’s indefinite suspensions differ from a termination in name only. ” Lin wrote in Tuesday’s order.  She added that the letters informing UCLA of the grant suspensions “fail to provide a ‘grant-specific explanation’ for why the award has been terminated, as required by the Preliminary Injunction.”Some federal judges have faulted the Trump administration for never defining what it considers DEI but cancelling funding to schools based on those violations anyway.“Although a new presidential administration is entitled to develop programs with its chosen priorities, the Executive may not set out to suppress ideas it deems dangerous by trying to drive them out of the marketplace of ideas,” Lin wrote in her June preliminary injunction.
How we got here
The Trump administration suspended UCLA’s grants over allegations that the campus isn’t doing enough to combat antisemitism. The National Science Foundation sent a letter to UCLA on Aug. 1 that accused the campus of admitting students based on race, even though all public campuses in California have been barred from affirmative action since state voters eliminated the practice in 1996.The letter also accused the campus of relying on admissions essays to determine an applicant’s race. But when the Supreme Court of the United States struck down affirmative action in 2023, the majority ruling allowed campuses to allow students to write about their race and identity in admissions essays.The science foundation made similar accusations against Harvard University when it terminated that campus’s grants. 
The 800 grant suspensions followed a federal Department of Justice report last month that accused  the campus of not doing enough to address antisemitism, particularly related to events during last year’s pro-Palestine protests, which included overnight encampments erected by protesters. The report came months after UCLA commissioned a task force to investigate antisemitism on campus and come up with recommendations that UCLA leaders said they’d implement.
That report published the same day UCLA agreed to a $6.45 million settlement with four Jewish plaintiffs. That deal was opposed by several pro-Palestinian professors and students, some of whom are Jewish.Last year a federal judge in the case sided with the Jewish plaintiffs who said that the anti-Israel sentiment displayed by protestors in the encampment violated their religious liberties because of their spiritual ties to Israel. “Jewish students were excluded from portions of the UCLA campus because they refused to denounce their faith,” the judge, Mark C. Scarsi, wrote in his preliminary injunction.
Various Jewish groups debate whether anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitic. The UCLA encampment included Jewish participants.
About a week later, on Aug 8, the Trump administration sent UCLA a settlement proposal of $1 billion that the school would pay over several installments in exchange for getting back the suspended science grants, CNN first reported. The settlement also sought to ban overnight demonstrations at UCLA, but that was already campus policy before last spring’s pro-Palestine protests; the UC reaffirmed those bans systemwide last fall. 
How California responded
Gov. Gavin Newsom said Trump “has threatened us through extortion with a billion dollar fine unless we do his bidding” at a press conference on Friday hours after CNN first reported Trump’s settlement demand. Newsom said “we’ll sue” last Friday when a reporter asked how California will respond. The state’s attorney general has already filed 37 lawsuits against the Trump administration, including several tied to education funding.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said “bring it on, Gavin” at a press conference Tuesday.
“A payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,” said UC President James B. Milliken in a statement about the $1 billion settlement demand. UCLA has also continued its media blitz highlighting the human benefits of the university’s health and science research. 
The settlement demand “does not make Jewish students safer,” the Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California said in a statement Tuesday. The advocacy group 39 organizations that offer family services, political advocacy, immigration legal aid and other nonprofit work.The Jewish affairs committee pointed to several strides UC and UCLA made to curtail antisemitism and promote safer campuses. “Meaningful progress is already underway in California,” the group wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 21:56:42.739619

Branch Out Burlington, a tree nursery located in the University of Vermont Horticulture Farm, has been providing trees to Vermont towns and organizations for almost 30 years.

Camryn Woods is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
BURLINGTON — On a warm Sunday evening in June, Margaret Skinner crouched near a young honey locust tree and plucked away the net of weeds that surrounded it. Her efforts, she knew, could help the sapling breathe by reducing its competition for nutrients and water.
This honey locust is just one of 600 trees that Skinner and her team of volunteers nurture throughout the summer. Most of the trees, having traveled in a tractor trailer truck from Oregon, where the climate is better for cultivating trees, will spend their most vulnerable years being cared for in the South Burlington–based tree nursery called Branch Out Burlington.
Once they graduate from the nursery three to four years later, the trees will provide shade, carbon sequestration and valuable habitats throughout the state of Vermont.
Branch Out Burlington, affectionately referred to by its members as “BOB,” is dedicated to enhancing the urban forest in Burlington, engaging community members through events like tree walks and weeding days and hosting an annual tree sale. 
Skinner helped found the group in 1996 when the city lacked resources to care for its trees. Two years later, she was granted access to land that would become the nursery — at the time, stocked with only 40 trees, according to Skinner — which is currently located off of Shelburne Road in the University of Vermont Horticulture Farm.
“I don’t want to just plant trees. I want to make sure the trees that get planted in the community get cared for, because they weren’t and they were dying,” said Skinner, who also works full-time as an entomologist at the University of Vermont.
This care, Skinner said, includes removing weeds, selectively removing branches to improve health, securing trees in place with wooden stakes and watering them. Young trees can also be easily damaged by outdoor equipment like weedwhackers and lawnmowers, which should be avoided around them, she said.
That Sunday evening, Skinner was joined by the president of Branch Out Burlington, Jacob Holzberg-Pill, and the organization’s web designer, Nathan Hoffmann, who are part of the board’s eight to nine members.
When he found Branch Out Burlington, “I was looking for things to do that were outside, that were tree related, that were part of the community,” said Holzberg-Pill, who had moved to Burlington with his 1-year-old son. “I contacted Margaret, and I was like, “Hey, could I come help out?’”
Hoffmann joined the organization three years ago, when he was looking for volunteer opportunities as a graphic designer at OnLogic, a computer hardware manufacturing company. After attending multiple weeding events, he started going to the board meetings, cementing his long-term involvement.
“I wanted to learn more. There’s a wealth of knowledge here that you’d never believe. It was just such a cool opportunity to get more involved and to be a part of the community, doing something that was much bigger than me,” Hoffmann said.
On Tuesday, July 8, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., Branch Out Burlington held a Weeding Bee in the nursery, which is open to the public every second Tuesday during the summer months. Its 20-some attendees chatted, cleared weeds from tree beds and puzzled over iPhone pictures of unidentified damage on folks’ front yard trees.
Once the weeding was done, Skinner provided free pizza and homemade cookies to volunteers. A ticket raffle was held, with prizes ranging from urban forestry books to a handmade wooden birdhouse.
“It’s a really special, fun way to get away from the work week and meet wonderful community members of all ages and from all over,” Hoffmann said. 
The Essex Junction Tree Advisory Committee, established by the city council in 2013, also makes an effort to be at the Weeding Bees. They have two rows of trees specifically allocated to the city, but volunteers help care for the entire nursery. 
“It was a win-win for us because we could, with our budget, be able to really increase the number of trees we could get into the community,” said Nick Meyer, chair of the committee.
Weeding Bees and Branch Out Burlington’s other volunteer opportunities, like pruning and grafting workshops and tree planting events, make urban trees economically viable for cities. 
When trees are bought older and immediately ready to plant in urban environments, they’re much more expensive, according to Holzberg-Pill — potentially around $500 each. 
Instead, Branch Out Burlington buys its trees from Oregon nurseries for $50 at younger ages with the knowledge that they’ll be stewarded by volunteers for a few years until they’re ready to move. 
Branch Out Burlington’s July 2025 newsletter wrote that it give away hundreds of trees to local schools, towns and non-profits that have the means to take care of them every year. The ability to fund projects like this comes from donations and tree sale profits. 
Green Mountain Farm-to-School, a nonprofit that builds healthy school environments, the Intervale Community Farm, a Burlington-based agricultural center, and Perkins Pier in Burlington, for example, have received tree donations, according to the newsletter.
Going forward, Skinner hopes to continue developing Branch Out Burlington’s media presence. “We are lucky to get 20 people up here to help take care of these trees once a month,” she said. “As I look around the nursery, I could spend every day, all day, and there would still be work to do.”
Urban trees are becoming more important as the climate warms, according to Meyer. 
“If we didn’t have any trees on all our sidewalks and open areas, days like today would be even hotter,” Meyer said. Cooling the temperature in cities and slowing rainfall in tree canopies are forms of stormwater management, and green spaces can give a visually softening effect to concrete environments, Meyer said.
“Hopefully these trees are going to be here for generations,” he said.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A multi-year investigation centered on multiple motels, “brow and lash” salons and alleged human trafficking in and around Nebraska’s largest city has led to charges against five people in the hotel business. 
The five are accused of crimes ranging from alleged sex and labor trafficking, fraudulent use of visas, money laundering and concealing undocumented immigrants, law enforcement officials announced Tuesday.
Also seized as part of the search warrants was $565,000 in cash. A representative of U.S. Homeland Security said workers in the country without proper documentation also were detained, though he declined to disclose how many.
Eugene Kowel, special agent in charge of the Omaha FBI, said child victims as young as 12 years old were involved in a case he described as “absolutely horrific.” A statement said officers “rescued” 10 minors and 17 adults from the alleged labor trafficking conspiracy.
“Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery,” Kowel said. “This investigation revealed victims right here in the heartland forced into sexual activity, living and working in dangerous and filthy conditions and extorted to work in grueling jobs with little to no pay.”
Kowel said investigators became aware of activity about four years ago, assisted by calls and concerns from the public. 
He said the case involved “sex for rent,” drugs and more. On one occasion, he said, a source working with the federal government entered a hotel room where immigrants slept on the floor with cockroaches crawling on them.
Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said more than 100 Omaha officers worked the case at various points, mostly since earlier this year, when an alleged juvenile sex trafficking case was revealed at one of the hotels that was also part of Tuesday’s crackdown. That property, the AmericInn near Interstate-80 and 13th Street, is adjacent to Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo.
Other motel properties upon which agents converged Tuesday: New Victorian Inn & Suites near 108th and L Streets; Rodeway Inn at 1110 Fort Crook Road South in Bellevue; The Inn (formerly Super 8) at 9305 S. 145th St.
Ten other businesses associated with the accused also were searched under a warrant, the officials said, including “brow and lash” salons in the Westroads Mall and other Omaha metro locations.
The five people accused of alleged crimes, according to the U.S. Attorney for Nebraska, Lesley Woods: Kentakumar Chaudhari, 36, of Elkhorn; Rashmi Ajit Samani, 42, of Elkhorn; Amit Prahladbhai Chaudhari, 32, of Omaha; Amit Babubhai Chaudhari, 33, of Omaha; and Maheshkumar Chaudhari, 38, of Norfolk.
According to a U.S. Attorney’s Office statement, sex trafficking was encouraged at the hotels — “protected from law enforcement detection, and sex trafficking victims at the hotels were subjected not only to the traditional perpetrators of a sex trafficking scheme but also to hotel management and employees victimizing them as well.”
The statement said, “Drug traffickers allegedly received protection from law enforcement in the same manner in which human traffickers were also shielded by the hotel owners and managers.” 
Kowel said at least one of the accused is charged with conspiracy to defraud the government through a scheme designed to obtain a U visa, which are for victims that help law enforcement prosecute crimes.
In that situation, he said, a hotel owner is accused of staging a fictitious robbery at a salon in 2022, the goal allegedly being to secure a U visa for one of the other defendants by representing her as a victim.
The federal government is taking steps to prevent the sale or transfer of the hotels during the ongoing investigation. The officials said 11 agencies and about 300 law enforcement officers were involved in the FBI-led investigation.
Among the agencies: the Nebraska State Patrol, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Attorney’s Office of Nebraska and Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office.

Cheyenne court says the injunction against voucher law will remain as schools chief appeals the order to the Wyoming Supreme Court.
The post Judge keeps freeze on spending state funds for private education appeared first on WyoFile .","A judge Tuesday said his temporary halt on a law that would allow state money to fund education at private schools will remain in place while his injunction is appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court.
District Court Judge Peter H. Froelicher denied a request by Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and others to let the law take effect while they challenge his preliminary injunction. 
Degenfelder wants state money to be disbursed while voucher supporters challenge a lawsuit brought by the Wyoming Education Association and others. Wyoming students are set to return to school soon for the fall semester.
The WEA sued Degenfelder, State Treasurer Curt Meier and the state of Wyoming on June 13, claiming that the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act violates the Wyoming Constitution by allowing public funds to be used for private education for more than just the needy.
“Defendants and Intervenors failed to show they are likely to succeed on appeal.” Judge Peter Froelicher
Degenfelder and intervenors Nicolette and Travis Leck and Victoria Haight argued that they were likely to win their appeal and would be harmed while the voucher program is on hold.
“Defendants and Intervenors failed to show they are likely to succeed on appeal and failed to show they will suffer an irreparable injury,” Judge Froelicher wrote. “The preliminary injunction will maintain the status quo.”
WEA president Kim Amen hailed the decision. “We appreciate the thorough and thoughtful approach that the judge continues to take in this case,” Amen said in a statement.
Degenfelder was not prepared to comment by press time.
How we got here
Froelicher blocked the law on June 27, five days before it was to take effect. Wyoming families had submitted nearly 4,000 student applications for the program through late June. The program would give applicants up to $7,000 a year.
The WEA, which represents more than 6,000 state public school employees, filed its lawsuit along with nine parents of school-aged children.
In her motion to remove the temporary injunction, Degenfelder argued that Froelicher misread the constitution’s declaration of a fundamental right to education. But Degenfelder’s arguments ignore “plain and unequivocal terms” in the constitution that restrict legislative power on the issue, the judge wrote.
Degenfelder and Meier also failed to convince the judge that the injunction allows the WEA to “dictate the quality of education for other Wyoming students.” The court’s interpretation of the constitution also does not block all state programs that fund private entities, as alleged by Degenfelder, the judge said.
Also, there are no real consequences of the injunction to the Lecks and Haight, Froelicher wrote. The three “will not suffer any irreparable injury because their harm can be remedied if this Court is reversed and the Act is implemented,” his order reads.
Froelicher also knocked down Degenfelder’s arguments based on school funding cases in West Virginia, Ohio, Nevada and North Carolina.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Democrats spent a Tuesday press conference painting Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley as an extremist, pointing to his support of former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who lost his gubernatorial bid last year after numerous inflammatory remarks.
At the state Democratic Party headquarters, state Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Wake) called Whatley a “Washington big oil lobbyist” who has “consistently elevated the most extreme forces in this party and in North Carolina,” specifically mentioning Robinson.
Whatley, who has served as the national Republican Party Chair since March 2024, announced last month he will seek the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Sen. Thom Tillis. His announcement, which came with the support of President Donald Trump, followed on the heels of former Gov. Roy Cooper declaring his candidacy for the seat, setting up what is expected to be one of the most expensive races in the country in next year’s midterm elections.

Rubin referenced a 2022 remark by Whatley, then the state Republican Party chair, in which he called Robinson “the greatest lieutenant governor in the United States” amid controversy over Robinson’s apparent incitement to violence against transgender people and libraries hosting “drag queen story hour.”
“His support for Robinson was steadfast even as Robinson said vile things about women, attacked victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and said, ‘We are called to be led by men, not women,’” Rubin said. “This election is a clear choice between results and resentment, between competence and culture wars.”
Shortly after Robinson’s victory in the 2024 Republican primary, Whatley endorsed his campaign for governor on social media. “North Carolina voters have delivered a resounding message that they want change in the Governor’s mansion and Mark Robinson is ready to deliver it!” he wrote in March. In the months that followed — as Robinson’s campaign collapsed into scandal over a CNN investigation into his online presence — Whatley expressed disappointment, but stopped short of disavowing the candidate.
“Those comments are absolutely antithetical to Republican values, and if Mark Robinson is going to continue in this race, then yeah, I do think he is going to have to demonstrate to the voters of North Carolina that those are not his words, his actions, or his values,” he told Bloomberg Radio in September.
Former N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, criticized Whatley that same month for enabling Robinson’s rise. In an interview with CNN, he said the former state Republican Party chair “ignored many known flaws that many of us knew about [Robinson] and just assumed they’d be brushed over,” calling Robinson “a ticking time bomb for several years now.”
World Tabernacle Church Pastor James Gaillard, a state Senate candidate, said at the press conference that Whatley “spent years here in North Carolina and also nationally elevating really dangerous people to powerful offices.”
“One of those dangerous individuals was our former lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, and I think it’s important that we connect those dots,” Gaillard said. “North Carolina doesn”t need someone representing us in the U.S. Senate who wants to be rewarded for having given us Mark Robinson.”
Ironically, before Tillis announced his retirement, Robinson had hinted that he might mount a primary challenge against him for the seat. Robinson bowed out in January the same day he announced he was dropping  a defamation lawsuit he filed against CNN during his gubernatorial campaign.
Little known by voters
Democrats are eager to define Whatley by his past support for Robinson as he prepares to face an electorate that knows little about him. An August 1 poll by Emerson College found that a plurality of registered voters who were surveyed do not know who he is, with 36% responding that they “have never heard of this person.” Another 30% said they had no opinion or were unsure how they felt about him.
That survey found Cooper leading Whatley 47% to 41%, with 12% of respondents unsure how they would vote. A popular two-term governor, Cooper boasts much higher name recognition than Whatley, with only 3% of those surveyed not recognizing his name. About 6% did not know who the retiring Tillis was.
Robinson ultimately lost the 2024 governor’s race by nearly 15% of the vote, the largest margin in more than 40 years. If Democrats successfully tie Robinson to Whatley, it could deliver them their first Senate victory in the state since 2008.


Beyond Robinson, the speakers at Tuesday’s press conference attacked Whatley over his support for the Republican “big, beautiful bill” cutting health care and social services spending, contrasting it with Cooper’s record of ushering in Medicaid expansion and extending coverage to nearly 670,000 additional North Carolinians.

“We cannot afford a senator like Mr. Whatley who called gutting Medicaid for over 650,000 North Carolinians, undermining our rural hospitals, ‘a big win,’ ” Rubin said. “We should reject Michael Whatley’s radical agenda and send a senator to Washington who will protect health care, lower costs, defend our freedoms, and safeguard our democracy. North Carolina deserves nothing less than Roy Cooper in the United States Senate.”
Jen Kalinowski, the mother of a girl born with a rare genetic disorder known as dup15q who requires constant care through Medicaid, also spoke at the press conference. Kalinowski said losing that care would have life-altering consequences for her family.
“She will never be able to gain any independence without her therapies. She certainly will not have the quality of care and support she needs. She will die without control of her seizures,” Kalinowski said. “We can’t elect a U.S. senator who rips away health care from those who need it more. I implore my fellow North Carolinians to please stand up for what’s right.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8123236-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-12 20:57:14.911730

Photo by Danielle E. Gaines. The Sierra Club’s board voted unanimously to remove Executive Director Ben Jealous for cause, a month after he was placed on leave, according to an email sent Monday to the environmental nonprofit’s staff.
The vote came after an “extensive evaluation” of Jealous’ conduct, according to the email from board President Patrick Murphy. The email did not describe the particular reasons for Jealous’ ouster.
Jealous, a former Democratic nominee for Maryland governor, was placed on leave last month over what a Sierra Club spokesperson would only describe as a “personnel matter.”
“The Sierra Club leads with our values,” Murphy wrote in Monday’s email. “That’s how we engage in communities across the country, how we fulfill our mission and achieve our goals, and how we interact with one another and our organization.
“The decision the Board made was a difficult but principled one to uphold these values and ensure every individual at the Sierra Club is held equally accountable, with no special treatment or favor for those holding influence and power,” his email went on to say.
In a statement issued through a spokesperson Tuesday, Jealous said that he had initiated a “process under my contract” to fight the termination.
“It is disheartening, unfortunate, but perhaps not surprising that the board has chosen an adversarial course that the facts so clearly cannot support,” Jealous wrote in the statement.
Sierra Club spokesperson Jonathon Berman said the board determined Jealous “engaged in conduct that constitutes cause under his employment agreement….  the entire Board determined that it had no other option than to separate from him in order to protect the organization, its employees, its values, and its mission.”
“Mr. Jealous had an opportunity for a dignified exit and we are disheartened to see he has instead unfortunately chosen an adversarial course.,” Berman’s statement said. “Mr. Jealous’ challenge to the Board’s unanimous cause determination has no merit.  We are confident that Mr. Jealous will not prevail in any forum, whether public or private.”
Jealous’ tenure at the national nonprofit was tumultuous, including several rounds of layoffs and other moves that drew ire from the Progressive Workers Union, which represents Sierra Club workers.
Progressive Wokers President Erica Dodt said in a statement Monday that the union was “heartened” to learn of Jealous’ termination for cause. Dodt cited the union’s “no-confidence” vote against Jealous one year ago, which she says was spurred by his “mismanagement of our organization’s strategy and budget and his ongoing attacks on our union.”
“We hope that his departure will open the door for a stronger relationship between workers and management, and allow the Sierra Club to better focus our efforts on fighting the Trump administration and protecting the environment,” Dodt wrote.
In a July 21 letter sent to Sierra Club leaders after Jealous was put on leave, Aaron Mair and Chad Hanson, former board members, defended Jealous, who is the nonprofit’s first Black executive director, and argued that he was treated differently than his white predecessors.
The two argued, in part, that Jealous was unfairly blamed for actions he took to balance the Sierra Club’s budget, including layoffs and other cost-cutting measures.
“The Sierra Club’s first Black Executive Director is being treated like a fall guy, unfairly blamed for Board and past management decisions made before he began his job,” Mair and Hanson wrote.
In a letter to the Sierra Club board Tuesday, the union’s Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) Caucus, pushed back against what they called “baseless accusations that PWU’s attempts to hold Mr. Jealous and his team accountable are rooted in racism.”
“BIPOC staff and allies alike have been voicing our concerns about Mr. Jealous’s leadership and actions, not because of his identity, but because of the impacts of his choices,” reads the letter.
The group argued that Jealous dismantled the Sierra Club’s equity department, and gutted other programs serving communities bearing environmental burdens. They also argued that layoffs overseen by Jealous disproportionately impacted staff of color, who made up less than a third of the organization but accounted for nearly half of the layoffs in 2025, according to the union’s data.
In its letter, the caucus argued that “dismissing Jealous is just the first among many steps” the board should take to repair the organization. It called for workplace morale and worker retention studies, as well as a voice in the hiring process for the nonprofit’s next executive director.
Jealous, a former leader of the NAACP, ran unsuccessfully to unseat Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) in 2018. After the race, Jealous took on consulting work, including for the Juul e-cigarette company, before he took the leadership role at People For the American Way, and then the Sierra Club.
In his statement issued Tuesday, Jealous touted a list of achievements during his tenure with Sierra Club.
“While I was recruited at a time of significant, diverse challenges for the club, I was able to create the most diverse leadership team in the club’s history,” Jealous wrote. “The board and I strengthened a weak financial base, crafted a progressive union contract, dramatically increased chapter directors in red states, and increased our advocacy capacity by building a stronger field department.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_3110-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 19:56:52.028041

Ben Ray Luján, right, sips a cup of coffee while speaking with Nancy Langer, managing partner of Red Rock Roasters, in Albuquerque on Tuesday.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The coffee industry in New Mexico and across the country was already in crisis when President Donald Trump’s second term began, owners of a prominent local roaster told U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján when he visited their Albuquerque headquarters Tuesday.
A sudden 50% import tax on one of their biggest suppliers is making business much more chaotic, and consumers of all types can expect prices to continue to increase in the months and years to come, Rachel Langer, coffee director at Red Rock Roasters, told Source New Mexico.
“Anybody who’s buying coffee by the pound has definitely already felt this, and they will only feel it more,” she said. “And people who buy coffee by the cup, because the coffee is such a small percentage of the total cost of the beverage, it’s not gonna feel as bad, but they are, in fact, also paying quite a bit more. It’s just, like, a slow drip.”
The 50% tariffs that went into effect on Brazil, which produces about one-third of America’s coffee supply, were just the latest chapter in an unpredictable and expensive few months for Red Rock Roasters, Langer said.
Even though Trump has created and then canceled various tariffs since taking office, Red Rock Roasters has consistently paid the tariffs since April, Langer said. That’s because the contracts she signs with coffee brokers are worked out months before the beans arrive at her roastery, she said.

In May, she presented Luján’s office with a petition she circulated among other New Mexico coffee roasters, calling on Luján to support the Trade Review Act of 2025, which would enable Congress to approve tariff changes. The Republican-controlled Senate has taken no action on the bill since it was referred to the Senate Finance Committee.
The petition said prices of raw goods she and other coffee roasters need were between 25% and 40% higher than last year.
After getting a tour of the coffee roaster, Luján told Source New Mexico that the tariffs across the state are hitting New Mexico businesses hard. Despite Trump’s promises, businesses and consumers are bearing the costs.
Washington’s Cantwell pushes plan to rein in Trump’s tariff power

“Everything that this President is doing is arbitrary. So that’s more uncertainty, more pressure on all these entrepreneurs, all these small businesses across the country,” the New Mexico Democrat said. “I’ve not spoken to one business in New Mexico yet that has told me that they are applauding these tariffs, whether it’s a toy store, restaurants, a manufacturing wholesaler.”
The new tariffs in Brazil will only increase prices on industry already going through hikes that result from crop failures and labor shortages, Langer said. And she said that the purported aim of the tariffs — boosting domestic manufacturing — make little sense for coffee, which can only grow in high elevations near the equator in tropical temperatures.
Coffee grows in Hawaii, but the state produces 5 million pounds annually in a country that imports 3.5 billion pounds each year, the local companies write in the letter.
“There truly is no domestic alternative to importing coffee,” the petition states. Nine coffee companies statewide signed the letter, including NM Piñon Coffee, the state’s biggest coffee company.
“We are, in fact, manufacturers. We are what American manufacturing looks like,” Langer said Tuesday. “It’s not making toothbrushes.”
Langer said she expects the price of a latte to increase by about 50 cents due to the latest round of tariffs. In the next year or two, she predicts that major coffee companies will buy up the stock of coffee from countries with lower tariffs, leaving her roastery and other smaller shops with only the most expensive options.
“We’re going to be stuck with whatever’s left. That’s my main concern,” she said. “We’re already on the backfoot.”

(Photo by Corrine Smith/Alaska Beacon)A long-awaited glacial flood is hitting Alaska’s capital city.
On Tuesday morning, local officials sent warning messages to cellphones across the City and Borough of Juneau, alerting local residents that the Mendenhall Glacier’s ice-dammed lake has burst its barrier and is sending a torrent of water toward homes and businesses in the Mendenhall Valley.
“We are prepared for this situation. We’ve been preparing for this situation,” said Sabrina Grubitz, public safety manager for the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, and the commander of a unified local government task force responding to the flood.
The flood is expected to peak Wednesday afternoon at 16.6 feet, likely setting a record and surpassing a flood last year that damaged more than 290 homes.
With the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stating that permanent flood barriers could be years off, local officials have installed semi-permanent HESCO walls in some neighborhoods to avert the worst flooding.
Those barriers have not yet been tested in an actual flood. 
Local officials have asked residents in the affected area to voluntarily evacuate in case the barriers do not perform as intended. 
During a briefing on Tuesday morning, Ryan O’Shaughnessy, director of emergency programs for the City and Borough of Juneau, gestured at maps showing the predicted inundation without the barriers.
“We strongly encourage everyone in the 17-foot inundation layer to evacuate their homes sometime today. There’s no need to rush out of neighborhoods, but we encourage folks to take a moment, take a deep breath, remember that they have a plan. This is something that we’ve been planning for as a community. Grab their go bag, let their family and friends know where they’re going, and then execute that,” he said.
Capital City Fire/Rescue Assistant Chief Sam Russell warned local residents to not stand on the flood barriers and for sightseers to stay away from the area.
Public radio and television station KTOO has set up several live video streams with instant information for people who want to keep an eye on the situation.
“I know everybody wants to see what’s going on, but we have cameras that are posted on the website, and you’ll be able to observe from there other things that are going on,” he said.
An evacuation shelter has been set up at nearby Floyd Dryden school, O’Shaughnessy said, and a non-emergency hotline has been set up for people who need information about shelter, transportation or other things. That number is 907-500-0890. Any road closures can be monitored at 511.alaska.gov.
As of Tuesday afternoon, much of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area — Alaska’s most-visited tourist attraction — was closed to the public. The glacier’s visitor center remained open, but most trails, including the heavily trafficked Nugget Falls Trail, campground and West Glacier Trail, were closed.
On Monday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a preemptive state disaster declaration “in response to an imminent threat of catastrophic flooding,” to support a coordinated interagency emergency response. “By issuing this declaration before the flood occurs, we can position state resources and personnel in advance to support local and tribal governments in their efforts to protect
lives, homes, and essential services,” Dunleavy said in a statement with the announcement. “Our goal is to act early to reduce impacts and preserve community safety.”
This week’s flood has been anticipated for months. Since 2011, the Mendenhall Glacier has caused floods each summer as Suicide Basin — a glacially locked lake — fills with meltwater and runoff, then bursts from its confines after the water overtops an icy dam.
As more ice melts amid global climate change, the flooding has grown worse. In 2023, the flood eroded the Mendenhall River’s banks, causing homes to collapse. In 2024, the flood was the worst yet.
After that experience, city and local officials mobilized to avoid a repeat, and they’ve been monitoring Suicide Basin closely.
This week’s flood was forecast well in advance, and residents were repeatedly warned ahead of time. On Monday, workers went door to door, distributing almost 900 warning flyers, “and there’s an additional 200 residents that are being contacted this morning directly,” O’Shaughnessy said.
Nicole Ferrin, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service forecast office in Juneau, said officials expect the Mendenhall River “to continue to rise through the next 24 hours, with a crest sometime Wednesday afternoon, around 16.6 feet. But that plus or minus half a foot, so a range of 16.3 to 16.8 is probably more fair.”
That expectation is based on prior experience and computer modeling, and it could be altered by tomorrow morning, she said.
“I should note that we’re already at minor flood stage,” she said Tuesday morning, “and this will be a new record based on all of the information that we have.”

(Courtesy of Governor's Office)The South Dakota Attorney General’s Office said Tuesday that the suspect in the recent seizure of 207 pounds of crystal methamphetamine has been indicted on two state felony counts and could face additional federal charges.
The office also identified the suspect as 42-year-old Alonso Molinacorona and said the arrest occurred Friday night on Interstate 90 in Sturgis, which was during the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.
“Meth of any amount is dangerous, but distribution of meth with a street value of $12 million would have led to grave consequences for our citizens,” Attorney General Marty Jackley said in a news release. “I appreciate the excellent work of the South Dakota Highway Patrol in stopping and arresting this defendant.”
Jackley said a trooper stopped Melinacorona for speeding before discovering the drugs.
The updates from Jackley came one day after Gov. Larry Rhoden announced the arrest and described the suspect as a man who is not a U.S. citizen, but did not disclose the suspect’s name. Rhoden described it as the Highway Patrol’s largest-ever meth seizure.
Jackley’s office listed Molinacorona’s address as Fresno, California, and said he is a Mexican citizen.
According to Jackley, the Meade County grand jury indictment charges Molinacorona with possessing more than 5 grams of meth with intent to distribute, and an alternate count of unauthorized possession of a controlled drug or substance. If convicted of the first count, he would face a mandatory minimum sentence of one year in prison and a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine. The alternate count has a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Molinacorona made his first appearance in Meade County Court on Monday and pleaded not guilty. He is being held without bond.

Article Summary

U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries made a stop in Springfield one day before keynoting a breakfast with Illinois Democrats.
Jeffries, Sen. Dick Durbin, Rep. Nikki Budzinski and Sen. Tammy Duckworth visited Springfield groups to gather feedback about President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill.”
Senators believe public pressure and a strong 2026 election by Democrats could force Congress to undo parts of the bill.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois Democrats brought some of their biggest names to Springfield Tuesday to call attention to the massive cuts that will take effect in the coming years for programs that benefit low-income communities.
At one event, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin and U.S. Rep. Nikki Budzinski hosted the Democratic leader of the U.S. House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, for a roundtable discussion at a Head Start school to talk about cuts to early childhood education and the food assistance program known as SNAP.
And at a separate event, Durbin joined Sen. Tammy Duckworth at a Springfield hospital to call attention to the impact health care providers will experience from cuts in federal funding for Medicaid.
Those cuts, along with a package of tax cuts, were all included in a massive domestic policy bill that the Trump administration pushed through Congress last month known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
“It’s going to be a tough election for this president because he took the wrong approach when it came to the big and beautiful bill,” Durbin told reporters at the Head Start program. “The American people do not want to see us cut back in the fundamentals in health care, in services of hospitals, to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people.”

Tuesday’s events came as Democrats prepared for the annual Governor’s Day at the Illinois State Fair, an event where they typically showcase their slate of candidates for the next election and try to stir up public enthusiasm for the race.
Jeffries, of New York, stands to become the next speaker of the U.S. House if Democrats win back control of the chamber in 2026. He is scheduled to be the keynote speaker Wednesday morning at a brunch hosted by the Illinois Democratic County Chairs Association.
“On the public scene, the one big, ugly bill, which is now law, is deeply unpopular,” Jeffries said, referring to public opinion polls. “Because the American people don’t like the fact that they’re ripping health care away from millions of people, stealing food from the mouths of children, and all of this is being done to reward their billionaire donors with massive tax breaks while exploding the debt by more than $3 trillion.”
Health care implications
Durbin and Duckworth also met with the leaders of Springfield-area health care providers to seek guidance on the problems they anticipate facing as a result of the bill’s Medicaid cuts, including hospital closures.
“There are places that will not survive,” Durbin said. “We know they will not survive, and the impact it’s going to have on real people, on families and on the economic future of the communities that lose these facilities is going to be felt for a long, long time.”
Hospital leaders said they’re concerned about declining funding, but also patients who lose coverage and delay care, which leads to more expensive care for more serious problems in the future.
More than 330,000 Illinoisians could lose Medicaid coverage as a result of the bill while several hospitals in rural areas face closure, according to the governor’s office.

The senators said they believe congressional Republicans will eventually be pressured into undoing many of the cuts in the bill, but that persuasion will have to come from their constituents. Duckworth suggested every health care office put flyers in the waiting room explaining the impacts of the bill, which she hopes would prompt patients to contact lawmakers.
Durbin said he believes favorable results for Democrats in the 2026 election could make Republicans responsive to concerns about the bill and force Congress to make changes if Democrats control the House.
“I’ve been through a lot of election cycles, and I will tell you, the House members are the most sensitive because many of them haven’t been there that long, and they’re in marginal districts,” Durbin said. “So I think this could turn out to be a movement to change that bill back, and soon.”
Durbin said that even in a scenario with Trump in the White House and Democrats controlling the House, he expects there would be bipartisan negotiations that could undo parts of the bill.

Lundstrum and Clark were the lead sponsors of the 2021 law that was blocked in court before it could go into effect. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)A federal appeals court lifted the injunction on Arkansas’ law banning transgender minors’ health care, clearing the way Tuesday for it to be enforced after four years.
The 8-2 ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came after Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office asked the court last month to take into account the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to uphold Tennessee’s similar law. Federal judges previously enjoined both the Tennessee and Arkansas laws.
The Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act, or Act 626 of 2021, banned puberty blockers, hormones and gender-affirming surgeries for Arkansas children with gender dysphoria. Four families of transgender minors challenged the law, and U.S. District Judge James Moody blocked it in July 2021 before it could go into effect.
Several months after an eight-day trial over the law, Moody ruled it was unconstitutional on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds in June 2023.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas represented the plaintiffs in the case. Executive Director Holly Dickson called Tuesday’s ruling “tragically unjust” and the SAFE Act “a dangerous law that harms children” in a news release.
“As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want transgender Arkansans to know they are far from alone and we remain as determined as ever to secure their right to safety, dignity, and equal access to the health care they need,” Dickson said.

Griffin lauded the ruling in his own news release.
“I applaud the court’s decision recognizing that Arkansas has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological health of children and am pleased that children in Arkansas will be protected from risky, experimental procedures with lifelong consequences,” Griffin said.
 The court’s opinion

After the state appealed Moody’s ruling, the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in the case last year in St. Louis.
In June, the appeals court asked both sides for supplemental briefs in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on the Tennessee law. The plaintiffs’ brief asked the appeals court to send the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Tuesday’s ruling granted this request.
Both sides asked the court for rational-basis review, which means analyzing whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. The standard is less rigid than strict scrutiny, which analyzes whether a law is narrowly tailored to a governmental interest.
The SAFE Act “prohibits medical care on the basis of sex,” in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Moody wrote in his 80-page ruling. He also wrote that the rational basis test “does not apply when a classification is based upon sex.”
The appeals court disagreed, stating in its 35-page opinion that the SAFE Act “classifies based on age and medical procedure, not sex” and “regulates a class of procedures, not people.”
Moody also ruled that the SAFE Act violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to due process because the state did not provide sufficient evidence to support its claim that gender-affirming medical care is unsafe for minors.

USCA-OPINION-081225 
The parent plaintiffs asserted that the law infringed upon their right to make informed decisions about their children’s medical care, but “parents do not have unlimited authority to make medical decisions for their children,” the appeals court stated.
The court also disputed Moody’s claim that the SAFE Act violated the First Amendment right to freedom of speech by prohibiting physicians from referring patients to other health care professionals for gender-affirming care. Moody called this an unconstitutional “content and viewpoint-based regulation.”
U.S. Supreme Court precedent allows states to regulate professional conduct that “incidentally” includes speech, and the law’s use of the word “refer” should be applied narrowly to a formal medical referral rather than the broad interpretation of “merely informing patients about the availability of procedures,” according to the appeals court’s opinion.

 Responses

The appeals court has yet to issue a mandate for the state to enforce the SAFE Act, but Griffin said at a Tuesday press conference that he expects the order within the next couple of weeks.
State Rep. Robin Lundstrum and Sen. Alan Clark, the primary sponsors of the SAFE Act, joined Griffin at the press conference. Lundstrum, an Elm Springs Republican, thanked the conservative Family Council for its support of the SAFE Act, and the organization called Tuesday’s ruling “amazing news” in a news release stating that it expects the law to be enforced.
Lundstrum praised her fellow lawmakers for supporting the law, which had 64 cosponsors in the 135-member Legislature, and for voting to override then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s veto.
“They put their political futures at risk by saying children are more important than politics,” Lundstrum said.
Arkansas was the first state in the U.S. to ban gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, and 26 more states followed suit, including Tennessee. Officials in both states have claimed transgender health care for minors is rooted in activism and experimentation rather than evidence-based science. Lundstrum and Clark, a Lonsdale Republican, repeated these sentiments Tuesday.
Clark cited his experience as a former youth pastor as a reason not to “affirm” gender dysphoria “instead of doing the real psychological work” to determine the root of a child’s dysphoria.
“Teenagers believe one thing one day and one thing the next day,” Clark said.
Transgender teen shares experience with gender-affirming care in trial against Arkansas law

Lundstrum said she introduced the 2021 legislation after hearing from “grandparents concerned about their grandchildren” and has been asked consistently in the past four years when the law will go into effect.
“The adults are walking back in the room on this issue and saying… ‘We don’t chemically or surgically castrate a child,’” she said.
Two physicians who have treated transgender minors at Arkansas Children’s Hospital are among the plaintiffs challenging the SAFE Act. They testified at trial in 2022 that they do not perform breast or genital surgeries on transgender minors or refer them for such procedures elsewhere.
Arkansas Children’s did not respond to a request for comment about the ruling Tuesday.
One parent of each of the four minor plaintiffs shared their experiences with their children’s gender transitions at the trial. Three of the four minors have since turned 18. The fourth, Brooke Dennis, is 13 years old. The Dennis family has moved from Bentonville to another state in which Brooke’s health care is not in jeopardy, according to court documents.
In 2023, the Legislature passed the Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act, which created a 15-year window for malpractice lawsuits against doctors who provide transgender minors with any of the same treatments the SAFE Act sought to ban. A 2025 law added mental health care professionals to the list of providers that can be sued under the 2023 law.
An effort to create civil liability for Arkansas adults who assist transgender minors’ transitions failed to advance in the Legislature after lawmakers, Griffin’s office and members of the public expressed free speech concerns in March.

Yellowstone National Park, one of the biggest drivers of Montana’s thriving tourism sector, is seeing near-record numbers of visitors this year.
Park officials announced Tuesday that Yellowstone had hosted 974,109 recreation visitors in July, down 2% from the same month last year.
But during the first seven months of the year, tourists visiting Yellowstone number 2,666,031, less than 3,000 fewer visitors than the park saw over the same period during 2021, the all-time record year with more than total 4.8 million visits.
Data from earlier this year showed that Yellowstone, and Glacier National Park in northwest Montana, were on pace for record-breaking years.
Through the end of June, the latest report available, Glacier had seen nearly 40,000 more visitors than during its record year of 2017.
The list below shows the year-to-date trend for recreation visits to Yellowstone National Park over the last several years (through July):

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Backers of Arkansas’ law requiring public display of the Christian commandments asserted Tuesday that the law is constitutional and based on historical tradition rather than religion.
A federal judge in Fayetteville on Aug. 4 temporarily blocked enforcement of Act 573 of 2025 in a lawsuit brought by parents of public schoolchildren in Northwest Arkansas school districts. The ruling affects only Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville and Siloam Springs schools.
Pine Bluff schools put up posters of the Decalogue donated by local ministers on Aug. 5, the day the law took effect, The Pine Bluff Commercial reported. The website of RestoreAmericanSchools, a group that supplies Ten Commandment posters for schools, says 288 Arkansas schools have been “adopted” by donors. 
At a press conference in the state Capitol’s Old Supreme Court room Tuesday, the law’s principal sponsors — Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, and Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs — told a small gathering that Act 573 remains in effect elsewhere in Arkansas. They and other speakers encouraged people to donate to a campaign to place posters of the Ten Commandments in public schools and buildings.
“You cannot separate the history of our nation and the founding of our laws and justice system from the Ten Commandments,” Brown said. “We stand behind this law and believe it will be upheld in a higher court.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Other speakers Tuesday repeated the message that the Ten Commandments traditionally have been displayed in public spaces and schools and that only since the 1980s have U.S. Supreme Court rulings chipped away at that tradition.
David Barton, a Texas political activist and founder of the conservative Christian organization Wallbuilders, said a 2019 Supreme Court ruling changed the criteria for determining whether Christian symbols and monuments violated the Constitution. In that case, Barton said, the high court shifted to presuming constitutionality if it could be shown to be historical and traditional.
Jeremy Dys, senior counsel with religious freedom legal group First Liberty Institute, also talked about the 2019 high court ruling, saying “the burden of proof now rests” upon those who want to take down public displays of religious symbols to show how the memorials and monuments are “out of step … with American history, with our traditions as a country.”
Dys said the Aug. 4 decision by U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks was “exactly backwards from what the Supreme Court said in the American Legion case.”
Brooks’ ruling noted that Arkansas’ law is “most likely … [a] part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms. These states view the past decade of rulings by the Supreme Court on religious displays in public spaces as a signal that the Court would be open to revisiting its precedent on religious displays in the public-school context.”
But, Brooks said, the Supreme Court 45 years ago struck down a state law nearly identical to Arkansas’ law. That precedent remains binding, he wrote, until the Supreme Court “puts its foot down.”
Education news outlet The 74 reported last month that a data analysis of 28 bills similar to Arkansas’ law “exposes how their language, structure and requirements are inherently identical. In dozens of instances, they match model legislation pitched by Barton verbatim.”
At Tuesday’s press conference, Patriot Mobile CEO Glenn Story presented a framed copy of a Ten Commandments poster to Secretary of State Cole Jester. Patriot Mobile describes itself as a Christian conservative wireless provider and was one of about 20 organizations whose logos were displayed with Ten Commandments posters at the press conference.

Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/state-workers-remote-work/,Proponents of remote work for California state employees are celebrating a new state audit that finds having employees work from home could save the state hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate and facilities costs.,"In summary
Proponents of remote work for California state employees are celebrating a new state audit that finds having employees work from home could save the state hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate and facilities costs. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom appears to have arbitrarily ordered workers back to the office without using specific rationale such as data on worker productivity, according to a newly released report from the California state auditor’s office.
The audit, which state legislators requested in May 2024 after the governor first ordered workers back to the office two days per week after they had been sent to work remotely during the COVID-19 lockdown, found that Newsom’s office failed to gather important information about departments’ office space needs and costs and did not use any data about state workers’ productivity to justify its in-office mandate.
Earlier this year, Newsom signed a new executive order that upped the required in-office days from two to four, but he relented in a series of contracts his administration signed with public employee unions. 
State Auditor Grant Parks concluded that California could save as much as $225 million per year and reduce its office space by nearly a third if it sticks to having employees in the office two days a week and working remotely three days a week.
The governor’s office also ignored survey findings from its own oversight agency, the Department of General Services, which had collected estimates from departments on how much office space they would need to bring workers back more often. 
“In general, we determined that a one‑size-fits-all approach to telework is counter to state policy and may limit opportunities for significant cost savings,” Parks wrote.
Supporters of work-from-home cheered the report as further vindication for their claims that Newsom’s return-to-office mandates were capricious, politically motivated decisions rather than a true effort to increase worker productivity. Union leaders say flexible hybrid work policies can simultaneously save the state money and help achieve ambitious climate and emissions goals by reducing commuter traffic. 
“This audit confirms what has been apparent for some time: Flexible telework benefits taxpayers, state government, and state employees,” said Ted Toppin, executive director of the Professional Engineers in California Government, a union representing state engineers, in a statement Tuesday.
The audit recommended that state lawmakers require departments to identify positions that can successfully telework three days a week and offer such an option. It also instructed the state to develop guidance for departments to evaluate the effectiveness of their telework programs.
Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom, said in a statement that the governor’s office “respectfully disagrees” with the auditor’s findings, which were based on “hypothetical theories and incomplete information.”
“This audit on state telework is not a scientific study, nor does it paint a complete picture of the state workforce or the benefits of working in person,” Gallegos wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/110722-Secretary-of-State-MG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 18:57:33.752019

Beker Rengifo Del Castillo, 33, is a Venezuelan citizen who was leaving a job near Whitefish Lake on April 24 when Hingiss stopped him, according to the lawsuit, allegedly for a broken brake light. Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection, and Del Castillo was left in the custody of a Customs and Border Protection officer and subsequently taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, “a horrific and traumatic experience,” according to court documents.
Whitefish City Attorney Angela Jacobs told the Daily Montanan in an email that the city cannot comment on active litigation.
The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Missoula. Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.
In the lawsuit, Del Castillo’s attorneys allege that Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection because Beker “only speaks Spanish” and Border Patrol may “want to check him,” despite Del Castillo providing “proof of his lawful presence in the United States in the form of his valid REAL ID compliant driver’s license.”
According to the complaint, Del Castillo entered the United States in July 2024 through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Del Castillo’s application for work authorization on July 23, 2024, and issued him a Social Security number.
Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars. According to the complaint, Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection “due to a language barrier,” but then left Del Castillo with a federal officer to “continue” the immigration investigation. The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.
“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.
Following his transfer to an ICE detention facility, Del Castillo was held until April 30, and then released with “no place to stay and no way to get home.”
“Because of this incident, (Del Castillo) is reluctant to leave his home and attempts to avoid all contact with law enforcement, fearing he will again be detained and incarcerated based on discrimination and without cause,” the complaint states. “(He) quit his jobs to avoid the risk of being racially profiled and incarcerated without basis while driving to and from work.”
According to the complaint, the Whitefish Police Department has a policy about immigration violations that Hingiss broke while detaining Del Castillo and calling Border Patrol. The policies include prohibiting officers from detaining “any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant;” and no one who is “otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status are unresolved.”
The policies, according to the lawsuit, also state that an officer must notify a supervisor when detaining someone for an immigration violation, and seek approval before conducting an arrest for an alleged immigration offense and before transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities.
During a Whitefish City Council meeting in May, Police Chief Kelch told councilors the city had policies that “that strictly prohibit biased-based policing and improper profiling,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. Kelch also stated that “we did not call Border Patrol for interpretation services.”
The lawsuit seeks actual, general and punitive damages and legal costs from the city of Whitefish and the police officers.

They came with promises of transformation: thousands of jobs, surging salaries and a foothold in the booming electric vehicle market.
Imola Automotive USA, a Boca Raton, Florida-based startup, pitched officials in small, struggling towns in Georgia, Oklahoma and Arkansas on a bold vision. The company planned to build six EV plants, create 45,000 jobs —  and help these impoverished communities secure a place in America’s green future.
But more than 18 months later, the company hasn’t broken ground on a single site. And its top executive — whose background is in television and athletic shoes, not automotive manufacturing — has gone silent.
A Floodlight investigation did not uncover lost taxpayer money in Fort Valley, Georgia; Langston, Oklahoma; or Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Imola has sought free land, municipal financing and other incentives for its shifting proposals. 
But an economic development watchdog said the episode illustrates how the frenzy to land electric vehicle jobs can leave economically distressed towns vulnerable to empty promises. 
Imola CEO Rodney Henry declined requests for an interview. He responded to Floodlight’s inquiries with a short statement, insisting the company had not given up on its plans, which have included a partnership with an Italian manufacturer of two-seat electric vehicles. 
“Our timetable has been modified due to matters outside of our control,” Henry said in a statement. “We are highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment. Due to proprietary consideration as well as NDA (nondisclosure) agreements, we are not at liberty to discuss specifics at this juncture.”
That’s a stark shift from the company’s earlier promises. In a press release issued in January 2024, Henry claimed the company had already secured land in multiple states to build half a dozen plants and create tens of thousands of jobs. 
Could someone with no experience in car manufacturing really deliver that?
“It’s ludicrous,” said Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and analyzes economic development projects. 
Building large auto plants, he said, requires “a great deal of capital, a great deal of management skill, a great deal of engineering and marketing chops. And obviously, Tesla developed those, but they didn’t do it overnight, right?”
Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff weren’t the only towns swept up in the competition to attract electric vehicle plants. Spurred by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions in private investment and expanded government incentives, local officials across the country scrambled to land high-paying manufacturing jobs and a slice of the booming clean energy economy.
Since the IRA passed in 2022, more than 150 EV plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for economic development good for the environment.
But that rush may be grinding to a halt. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which rolls back many federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles, is already throwing the EV sector into turmoil — threatening to stall or shrink the kinds of ambitious projects towns like Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that plans for 14 EV-related plants have been canceled this year.
Bold promises, then silence
In three towns where Imola pledged massive investment, there’s no sign of construction and little more than confusion.
Langston — a town of 1,600 where more than 35% of residents live in poverty — never saw Imola’s plans take shape.
A 2023 letter to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus stated that the company had run into “multiple obstacles,” including trouble acquiring enough land.
“In order for us to continue moving forward on the project we are requesting that the City of Langston convey to us any and all vacant properties owned by the city,” Pettus wrote.
Langston City Council member Magnus Scott said the company also asked the town to issue municipal bonds to help them build their plant. 
But before any land changed hands or bonds were issued, a company representative delivered unexpected news: The deal had been canceled. “I guess maybe they ran into financial problems,” Scott said.
Reached by phone, Pettus, of south Florida, said he’s no longer employed by Imola but instead works as a consultant for the company. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he declined to discuss Imola’s plans.
Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers. 
A year later, with no sign of progress on the plant, the company came back to the Georgia town with an entirely different proposal. This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town. 
One city council member balked.
“You want us to sign an agreement for 99 years before you bring us the car company,” said council member Laronda Eason, according to minutes of the March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait and switch.” 
Eason did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment on the Imola proposal.
In Pine Bluff, where per capita income last year was just over $21,000, city officials were initially all in. Writing to Henry in August 2024, then-Mayor Shirley Washington said the city of 39,000 stood ready to buy land, build infrastructure and issue industrial revenue bonds to support Imola’s vision. 
“With an anticipated employment base of more than 8,000 jobs,” Washington wrote, “we firmly believe this investment will marshal a pivotal turning point in our community.” 
But a year later, the project hasn’t moved. “We never did get off the ground with that,” Washington said in a brief phone interview.
LeRoy said Imola’s pitch fits a troubling pattern.
“It grabs me as an example of how the craze among governors and mayors to get the next big thing has caused some sloppy vetting,” he said of the struggling communities courted by Imola. 
Such towns, he said, are “easy prey. …They’re desperate.”
Grand vision, missing details
Henry, who lives in Florida, touts a background as a longtime TV executive producer and the founder of Protégé, an athletic footwear brand. He claims on his IMDB profile that Protégé donated a million pairs of shoes to African nations.
But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress. 
Floodlight found the website for Imola — named after the Italian city where Tazzari EVs are made — is no longer accessible without a password. A search of the Tazzari website found no mention of plants in the United States. But a 2024 version of the Imola site mentions the tiny vehicles “coming soon to America.”
In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership. 
The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren’t designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company’s Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company’s webpage.
Tazzari didn’t respond to email messages from a Floodlight reporter.
Henry said at that time that the company chose Langston and Fort Valley because of their universities. 
“Both of these locations are ideal,” he said in the January 2024 news release, “as their proximity to communities with institutions of higher learning, will allow residents and students career opportunities in the fast growing EV Technology and Innovation Industry.” 
Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston and Pine Bluff did not respond to interview requests. Few documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.
But it’s clear from available records that Imola’s promises stirred hope. 
Langston Mayor Michael Boyles called the proposal “transformative” in a January 2024 news release.
But some local leaders soon began to question the details.
Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, said parts of the plan didn’t add up. How, for instance, would the company house more than 1,000 workers in such a small town? And how were they going to build such a large plant on land without utilities or water?
Her doubts deepened when she learned that Imola wanted to lock down land agreements without putting up any earnest money.
“My early feeling was that, ‘Something is not quite okay with this,’ ” she said. “But I think the hope for our community kind of outweighed the ability to just take things slow and look at them for where they are and what they are — versus where you hope them to be.”
Eventually, the promise fizzled. 
“It was disappointing,” Johnson said. “…We could have had our energy and time focused on something that seemed more valid and more substantial.”
Still waiting for the shovels
Some residents in Fort Valley are still holding out hope.
Mayor Jeffery Lundy said early last year that it was a “priority for my administration to land a company like Imola Automotive USA.” Local officials, he said, were looking forward to the economic boost the plant would bring.
At the time, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and open the plant within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph. 
During a February 2024 town hall meeting, Imola officials told residents that the plant would pay employees an average of $45 an hour, according to a Facebook post. Commenters buzzed with excitement, with one writing: “Application me !!!!” 
Pettus told a local TV station that most jobs would require only a high school diploma.
In early 2024, Fort Valley rezoned land to accommodate the plant, and the city council signed off on the deal. But more than 15 months later, there’s still no sign of construction. 
Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting. A spokesman for Georgia Power said that while the utility doesn’t discuss economic development projects, “We’re prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.” 
Makita Driver, one of the Facebook commenters who’d voiced excitement about the proposed EV plant, said there’s no doubt she would have applied for one of the jobs there — had the facility ever been built.
“The pay rate was really what got my attention,” she said.
As a medical assistant, Driver said she earns far less than what Imola had promised. But she eventually concluded the promises were too good to be true.
“Who really makes that kind of money starting out?” she asked.
In a brief interview with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy said he’s still in contact with Henry.
“We are patiently waiting for that groundbreaking,” Lundy said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — When South Dakota Republican John Thune delivered his first remarks as U.S. Senate majority leader in January, he pledged to restore “regular order” to the chamber, including “bringing appropriations bills to the floor for serious deliberation.”
Tuesday, he said a stopgap spending bill will likely need to be negotiated with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown in October.
Congress didn’t finish its 12 annual spending bills before its August recess and would have to sprint to approve them by Oct. 1, which is the deadline to avoid a shutdown.
“We’re going to have a big fight at the end of September,” Thune told an audience at the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce Inside Washington luncheon.
He told reporters after the meeting that he hopes the spending extension would be for a short amount of time if Democrats don’t “work with us in a constructive way” through the traditional appropriations process.

In May, President Donald Trump released a budget request proposing $163 billion in spending cuts. Thune said the appropriations process would allow individual programs to be reviewed by members of Congress and potentially saved from cuts if “appropriators believe that they’re getting a good return for the American taxpayer.”
“I think that it’s in everybody’s best interests if the Appropriations Committee is able to do its work and then Congress, the House and Senate, pass appropriations bills and put them on the president’s desk for him to sign into law,” Thune said.
Thune also addressed Trump’s imposition of higher tariffs. Before last year’s presidential election, Thune criticized tariff proposals like Trump’s as “a recipe for increased inflation.” Tuesday, he offered a different take, referencing trade deals that have resulted from tariff negotiations.
“I do think that the ways in which they are using them, in my view, at least right now is yielding some results,” Thune said of the White House’s strategy. 
Afterward, Thune took questions from reporters on topics including immigration.
Lack of action on immigration is ‘holding SD back,’ dairy farmers say

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law last month provides $170 billion for immigration- and border-enforcement activities. Thune said the spending helps pay for “everything we need to keep the border secure and ensure we have an orderly way of processing people who are coming into the country, whether it’s for refugee status or otherwise.”
The next step, Thune said, should be to address workforce shortages with legal immigration policies. Thune said “it’d be nice” if Congress passed legislation so polices don’t change “from one administration to the next.” 
South Dakota relies on immigrants, especially in agriculture and tourism. Growing workforce needs will force the immigration issue “to be front and center,” he added.
“It’s an economic issue because of the impact that it has,” Thune said. “If you can’t find workers in our economy, that’s a big problem.”
The chamber’s Inside Washington luncheons are annual events inviting South Dakota congressional delegates to speak about issues affecting the state and businesses. Rep.

Two Washington agencies are proposing to dial the oil spill prevention rules for tankers and tank barges up a notch in the busy waterways between Skagit, Whatcom and San Juan counties. Even with the survival of the region’s iconic killer whales as a motivating force, the push is not exactly smooth sailing.
In recent weeks, the U.S. Coast Guard took issue with the state’s plans to expand a requirement for small to medium-sized tankers and towed barges to have tug escorts when underway with loads of oil or refined fuels. Simultaneously, multiple environmental groups and tribes are pressing the state to proceed with the rulemaking to further protect endangered orcas and the marine environment.
In a letter addressed to the state Department of Ecology and Board of Pilotage Commissioners, the Coast Guard Northwest District reasoned that an expanded tug escort requirement would increase vessel traffic unnecessarily.
“The overall reduction in oil spill incidents is negligible while significantly increasing vessel traffic in Puget Sound and adjacent waters,” wrote Captain Darwin Jensen, chief of prevention for the Coast Guard district office in Seattle. “More collisions and spills could result due to increased vessel traffic and risks to safety of navigation in congested waterways.”
More tugs traveling to and fro present an “incremental” risk that shouldn’t be discounted, but which is outweighed by the protection the tugs provide to prevent a potentially catastrophic oil spill, countered Fred Felleman, Northwest consultant to the group Friends of the Earth.
“Washington state’s admirable oil spill record is not because we’ve rested on our laurels,” Felleman said in an interview. “We’re committed to continuous improvement that has to be responsive to changes in the maritime trade – more petroleum products that are moving across the water in smaller vessels.”
The Washington Legislature tasked the pilotage board, in consultation with Ecology, to periodically review the tug escort requirement in question. That is why this debate is happening now. The tug requirement for this class of tank vessels first took effect in 2020.

Ecology estimated that tugboat companies get about 800 escort jobs per year in the Rosario Strait region due to the existing requirement. The oil tankers and towed barges targeted by these state rules are most commonly hauling refined products produced in northwest Washington – such as diesel, gasoline, jet fuel or heavy fuel oil – to customers near and far. Some crude oil also travels by barge from British Columbia via Rosario Strait to the U.S. Oil refinery in Tacoma, or less commonly to Anacortes.
The targeted class of vessels doesn’t look small when you stand close. They can exceed 600 feet long. The class – defined as 5,000-40,000 dwt, to be precise – includes an increasingly popular, efficient-to-operate type of tank vessel called an ATB, short for articulated tug barge.
The current rulemaking does not affect larger oil tankers used to import crude oil to the Pacific Northwest from Alaska and overseas. State law has long required those large oil tankers to have a tug escort to all destinations in Puget Sound when loaded.
Friends of the San Juans Marine Protection and Policy Director Lovel Pratt explained the beauty of a tug escort is that the tug can quickly assist to prevent a collision or grounding if an oil-laden vessel loses propulsion or steering.
“This is so important to prevent accidents and oil spills. If the tanker is at risk of getting into an accident, there is a tug there to help,” Pratt said.

Between 2017 and 2023, Ecology reported a handful of propulsion loss incidents and one minor collision between an oil barge and a bridge in north Puget Sound, where the agency determined an escort tug might have been helpful. None of those past incidents resulted in much, if any, oil spilling into the water.
The touchstone oil spills in Washington waters that inspired modern tanker regulations are now decades in the past. The Arco Anchorage, carrying Alaskan crude oil, ran aground in 1985 as it entered Port Angeles Harbor, spilling 239,000 gallons, which oiled several thousand seabirds. In 1988, the fuel barge Nestucca separated from its tug in heavy seas and spilled 231,000 gallons of bunker fuel along the Olympic Coast.
State regulators determined during an economic analysis that the ramped-up oil spill prevention measures would add cost to oil shippers by requiring more tug escort time. Foss Maritime’s published rates for tug escort services in north Puget Sound begin at $4,495 per hour before fuel surcharges, which easily add another $1,000 or more per hour.
The tug and barge trade association and the oil industry opposed the introduction of the Rosario Strait escort requirement back in 2019 when it first won legislative approval. This year’s proposed expansion and reaffirmation of the rules is drawing a more muted response. The American Waterways Operators and Western States Petroleum Association submitted public comments that mainly critiqued technical aspects of the Ecology Department’s risk modeling.
Tribes along the Salish Sea also appear keenly interested in what happens next. The Lummi and Swinomish tribes have long raised concerns about interference to their fishing and harvesting rights from increased vessel traffic. They renewed those concerns in letters to the pilotage board last month while also offering support for the oil spill prevention measures.
Comments submitted by the Port Gamble S’Klallam and Makah tribes dwelled on the balancing act the state must navigate between the benefits and impacts of more tug activity on the water.
Makah Tribal Chairman Timothy Greene Sr. called out the potentially harmful impacts to endangered killer whales from underwater noise generated by escort tugs. Tugboat operators themselves previously questioned whether increased underway time could be counterproductive to the state’s goals of reducing threats to the cherished resident orcas.
Pratt from Friends of the San Juans said tug escort operators could take mitigation measures to reduce underwater noise, such as going slower and maintaining a wide standoff distance when whales are present. Greene favored that approach as well and concluded that the Makah would ultimately support the state’s proposed expansion in the protection standard against oil spills, even if it only makes a marginal difference.  
“The Makah Tribal Council views the threat of oil pollution to Southern Resident killer whales (and other Makah cultural and natural resources) as a more significant threat than underwater noise, with longer-lasting and potentially more widespread impacts,” Greene wrote in his public comment.
Rosario Strait is a major route for tankers and towed barges headed to and from the oil refineries near Anacortes and Ferndale. The proposal in front of the state panel would reaffirm the existing tug escort mandate and extend the coverage zone toward Patos Island where the Strait of Georgia comes down to meet Rosario Strait. That would increase the zone’s size by about 11% to the north-northwest.
The pilotage board is also considering whether to require tank vessel captains and their tug escort to hold a short pre-escort safety conference before getting underway.
The commissioners have before them the staff’s “preferred alternative” to renew and expand the tug escort requirement. But the nine commissioners also can consider multiple alternatives that underwent environmental vetting. Those include scaling back or completely rescinding the tug escort rules for the small-to-medium class of oil tankers and towed barges, though the latter seems unlikely.
Board of Pilotage Commissioners Executive Director Jaimie Bever said her agency would ask for a meeting with the Coast Guard to get clarification of the federal concerns. Jensen said that the Coast Guard is comfortable with maintaining the existing regulatory regime.

OPI Superintendent Susie Hedalen said Tuesday she wants to ensure taxpayers aren’t funding empty buildings and teachers and parents are getting help when they reach out to the agency.
“Every day, Montana’s teachers show up, get dressed and serve Montana students. So should we,” Hedalen said in a prepared statement. “Public service at the expense of our taxpayers isn’t a come-and-go-as-you-please commitment — and our buildings shouldn’t be expensive storage units.”
  Susie Hedalen is sworn in as Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction at the Montana State Capitol on Jan. 6, 2025. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan).
Hedalen took the helm in January 2025 of an agency challenged with high turnover and one that had caused confusion in its dealings with schools and frustration among legislators.
The agency also faced a projected $772,300 budget deficit when Hedalen took the helm, chief of staff Dylan Klapmeier said in an email. He said Hedalen closed the deficit by the end of June.
He said she shored up the budget by operating “a bare bones executive office,” leaving vacancies open until the end of the fiscal year, and looking for duplicative or unnecessary services, subscriptions and contracts.
He said she saved “tens of thousands of dollars” in duplicative contracts, subscriptions and unused services, and likely saved hundreds of thousands in unnecessary future expenditures.
But OPI also pays $1.3 million a year in rent to the state of Montana for two buildings in Helena — not including utilities and maintenance — and Hedalen said she doesn’t want the agency to waste taxpayer money.
She said a majority of the 200 employees who work for OPI are based in Helena. Roughly 70% of the employees have telework agreements, which will be reviewed as part of the audit, according to OPI.
In an interview with the Daily Montanan, Hedalen said the effort she is launching is key to protecting tax dollars, being responsive to customers and helping students learn.
“We have a lot of work to do to increase our student outcomes, and I think this is a critical step to make sure that we’re all collaborating, we’re on the same page, and we’re doing our best to support our schools and our administrators and educators,” Hedalen said.
She anticipates the transition and review will take a couple of months, and it will comprise the following:

Inventory of every workstation at both OPI buildings,
Review of telework agreements and job classifications,
Assessment of space needs outside Helena,
Audit of equipment, tech and furniture, and
Evaluation of public availability and responsiveness.

Many employees including state workers started working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. But Hedalen said other state agencies already undertook efforts to transition back to office work, and it’s time for staff at OPI to do the same.
She said the shift will come with flexibility because not all jobs are the same.
For example, some OPI employees work on the Hi-Line to directly support a school, she said, and remote work makes sense in those cases.
In another change, she said some employees used to bill hundreds of dollars a month in mileage, but it’s less expensive to use the state motor pool.
Klapmeier said OPI had been paying “high mileage” instead of “standard” to employees but without following parameters for those reimbursements laid out in state statute.
Generally, if a motor pool car is available, but an employee requests mileage reimbursement anyway, they receive it at 48.15% of the federal rate, versus at 100% if a state car is not available.
He said OPI paid roughly $80,000 in personal vehicle reimbursements last fiscal year — even after OPI started following the law when Hedalen took over in January. He said projected costs had been even higher.
“We are now exploring rental vehicle and motorpool lease options and applying standard mileage reimbursement where appropriate instead of high mileage,” Klapmeier said.
Hedalen said in addition to her interest in saving dollars, the recent initiative comes partly due to complaints she heard about a lack of response from OPI to the public and those it serves.
Hedalen said customer service — to school administrators, parents and taxpayers — is one of her priorities.
Employees learned about the effort on Monday, Hedalen said, and some who already work in the office are eager to have more peers in their midst for collaboration.
“They feel like they could get a lot more accomplished if their colleagues were here on a daily basis,” Hedalen said.
She said the initiative mirrors similar efforts to scrutinize spending by fellow Republican leaders Gov. Greg Gianforte and President Donald Trump.
A letter Monday from Hedalen to the OPI team said coming out of the pandemic in 2021, the Department of Administration launched the Remote & Office Workplace Study.
She said it was a data-driven study on the state’s real estate inventory and best practices for workstation locations by job types — similar to an effort by the federal government.
“Up to this point, OPI has not participated in a ROWS-type study to ensure that our workstations reflect best practices for optimal work performance,” Hedalen wrote. “I have reached out to the Department of Administration, and they have been willing to share their work products from ROWS to assist OPI as we conduct this work at our agency.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Education-stock.jpg,,,2025-08-12 18:57:33.752019

“We’re all feeling it,” the founder of a Vermont mRNA manufacturer said of federal cuts.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced last week that his department would slash about $500 million in mRNA vaccine contracts, a hit to an industry already reeling from other public funding cuts. 
Those impacts are being felt in Vermont, experts say. 
Kennedy and other vaccine skeptics in President Donald Trump’s administration have espoused distrust of mRNA technology. But experts say the criticism is by and large inaccurate and the vaccines are safe and effective, having saved millions of lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.  
“We are now at a point where the most efficacious of technologies, because it’s new, is causing fear, and that fear has found a political outlet,” said Dev Majumdar, an immunologist at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine who focuses on RNA biology. “There’s no question that mRNA vaccines work.”
When used in vaccines, messenger RNA, known as mRNA, teach cells to create a protein or parts of protein that lead to an immune response, helping protect a person against a disease. Scientists can use the mRNA platform to develop vaccines more quickly, and the method is an alternative to other forms of vaccines, like those that include a weakened form of a pathogen.
The Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech used mRNA. Moderna has also developed an mRNA vaccine targeting Respiratory Syncytial Virus, known as RSV. 
Majumdar, who leads a UVM RNA lab, said scientists should continually prioritize how they talk to the public about vaccines and pandemic preparedness. It’s OK for scientists to acknowledge when past work has failed, he argued, and there should be no shame in celebrating successes.

“The public is a part of the process, and we have to constantly try to do better to bring the public in,” Majumdar said. 
In Vermont, the national debate and federal cuts to vaccine research is having an impact on a significant player in the mRNA manufacturing field.
Vernal Biosciences in Colchester manufactures mRNA — for research and clinical trials — as well as lipid nanoparticles, which help mRNA achieve scientists’ intended uses. With additional investment in recent years, the company has been able to follow stricter federal guidelines with the goal of expanding its client base.
Billions of dollars in cuts to public financing of research from the likes of the National Institutes of Health have hit the mRNA field hard, said Christian Cobaugh, Vernal’s founder and chief scientific officer. Plus, the industry, which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic, was flooded with new players, and demand has since dropped.

“We’re all feeling it,” Cobaugh said. “It just takes more money out of the total pool.”
When it comes to the impact of reduced public investment, Cobaugh said it ranges from the “specific” to “wait and see.” Cuts to National Institutes of Health grants led Vernal to stop some work mid-contract, he said, in the short-term costing the company in the six figures with a long-term impact in the seven figures. 
In addition to infectious disease vaccines, mRNA use has shown promise in treating cancer and in gene editing therapies. So far, the latter two applications have not been as targeted by federal funding cuts. 
The most recent Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority mRNA vaccine contract clawbacks mainly impact research and development into infectious diseases, according to Cobaugh. That’s a field central to pandemic preparedness, one that’s long relied on public funding.

“We will be less prepared” for the next pandemic, he said. “I don’t want people to be scared that we’re not going to be ready for this. We’re just not going to be as ready as we could be.”
As for the future of mRNA vaccines in a landscape marred by skeptics, Cobaugh said he believes opposition to the technology is fringe. 
“What we’re dealing with here is a fundamental loss in critical thinking skills,” he said. “If people continue to outsource their decisions to politicians of all stripes, we’re going to continue to struggle with technology and where it should fit into our lives.”
Majumdar fears cuts to vaccine research may harm the industry in ways that won’t become fully clear for a decade or more. 
“It’s hurt morale a lot among the people who spend 60 to 80 hours per week working on these things,” he said. “I really, really worry that we’re looking at the precipice of a lost generation of young people that really wanted to go into this, that wanted to cure cancer and fight disease.”

Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, alleges former Democratic state Rep. Jason Probst from Hutchinson engaged in a personal attack of him during the Kansas State Fair during a charitable event featuring the State Fair Foundation. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Rep. Kyler Sweely and former Rep. Jason Probst added a chapter to their political feud Tuesday by offering different interpretations of a verbal exchange that transpired at a charitable event for the Kansas State Fair.
The new dispute between the two men, whose legislative race was decided by 294 votes last November, involves the governor’s office, the Kansas Republican Party and an accusation that Probst made unspecified “homophobic remarks.” Probst said the accusation was a gross exaggeration.
The Kansas Republican Party released on Sweely’s behalf a letter Sweely sent to Gov. Laura Kelly alleging, without audio or visual evidence, that Probst made “homophobic remarks” during a short exchange with Sweely during the Boots and Bling event Saturday at the fairgrounds in Hutchinson. The Democratic governor appointed Probst to the State Fair Board about one month ago.
“His repeated conduct raises serious concerns about his fitness to serve in any official role representing the state of Kansas,” Sweely’s letter said. “I call on Governor Kelly to take this matter seriously. The people of the state should expect nothing less.”
In an interview, Sweely said he had a previous personal encounter with Probst that resembled the clash at the state fair foundation event.
Olivia Taylor-Puckett, a spokesperson for Kelly, said “the governor’s office is looking into the matter.”
Rob Fillion, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said Kelly should request Probst’s resignation from the State Fair Board.
“For a Governor Kelly appointee to make homophobic slurs to a state legislator at a public event is a disgrace,” he said.

‘Grossly exaggerating’
Probst, a Democrat who represented Hutchinson from 2017 until replaced by Sweely in January, said Sweely didn’t accurately portray their interaction at the state fair fundraiser attended by hundreds of people.
Probst said in a statement that Sweely was “doing all he can to deflect from his history of abuse and dishonesty.”
“If his feelings get hurt so easily, perhaps public service isn’t for him,” Probst said. “He is grossly exaggerating the exchange, which isn’t surprising coming from someone who can’t even be honest about something as simple as his address.”
Sweely’s letter to the governor’s office characterized the conduct of Probst approximately three hours into the event as “deeply troubling.” In the one-page letter, Sweely alleged Probst showed signs of being “visibly intoxicated.” Sweely said Probst approached him and “engaged in highly inappropriate behavior.”
“In full view of numerous attendees, including elected officials and local leaders, Mr. Probst made disturbing sexual comments, directed homophobic remarks at me and had to be physically restrained by friends due to escalating and aggressive behavior,” Sweely’s letter said.
Sweely said that regardless of political affiliation, such behavior was “disgraceful, unacceptable and damaging to the reputation of the fair board and the state of Kansas.”
 
The history
During the 2024 campaign for the Kansas House seat, Probst portrayed Sweely as someone not legitimately from Reno County. Probst said Sweely had engaged in “district shopping” to find a House seat in which a Republican could be competitive.
Several Republicans in Reno County asserted Sweely didn’t live at the residence where he signed a lease before filing as a House candidate.
Before ballots were counted in November giving Sweely a nearly 300-vote margin of victory, videos surfaced showing Sweely holding a pillow to the head of a woman lying motionless on a bed. The video was thought to have been taken during 2023 at a Wichita apartment. The video included an appearance by Rep. Avery Anderson, a Republican who serves a Newton district.
The Wichita Police Department investigated the images before they appeared online. The woman in the footage told investigators that she didn’t consider herself the victim of a crime.
Meanwhile, in February during a House floor debate, now-former Rep. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, posed a hypothetical question to Sweely about ordering the shooting of “that guy from Hutch,” a reference to a moniker Probst adopted for himself. Their back-and-forth was part of a House hazing ritual in which freshmen representatives undergo questioning by a colleague. This verbal targeting of a peer reflected the U.S. Army service of Penn and Sweely.
In response to the remarks by Penn and Sweely, House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard issued a statement denouncing “use of inflammatory rhetoric that incites violence in any form.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100269-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-12 18:57:33.752019

“As Idaho Falls continues to grow, it is essential that the airport grows with it,” Simpson said in a written statement issued Monday. “Expanding the Idaho Falls Regional Airport will better serve the Idaho Falls community, support local jobs and enhance the city’s status as a top destination for travelers and economic opportunities. I have been a steadfast supporter of our local airports, and I am pleased that this funding will facilitate these necessary improvements.”
The $12 million would be for one phase of a larger $60 million airport expansion project, said Idaho Falls Regional Airport Director Ian Turner.
The bottom line, Turner said, is the terminal has outgrown its design in almost every area. 
Since 2018, the number of passengers has grown by about 75%, he said. 
The area behind the ticket counter where checked bags are processed has been hit particularly hard. As a result, improving how checked bags are processed will be a priority during the expansion project, Turner said. 
“Growth here in east Idaho is continuing and putting pretty considerable constraints on the terminal building,” Turner said in a phone interview Tuesday.
Idaho Falls Regional Airport is the state’s second busiest airport, behind Boise Airport. In 2024, 307,942 passengers departed Idaho Falls Regional Airport and 302,699 passengers arrived at the Idaho Fall airport. 
 How would the federal funding be used to expand the Idaho Falls airport?

The airport expansion plan calls for adding space for baggage screening, adding additional office space, adding counter and ticketing space and adding space for equipment to move around. 
The expansion also calls for adding space on the second floor to add more gates when the time comes.
Over the last several years, the use and demographics at the Idaho Falls Regional Airport have changed significantly, Turner said.

Before the airport experienced rapid growth, it served a lot of business travelers. People from eastern Idaho leaving for business meetings or other trips and then coming home was a big part of the market. 
Now, Turner said recreation and tourism are drawing more people into Idaho Falls Regional Airport as they seek out national parks, skiing and other outdoor recreational activities nearby.
“The airport provides an important service to all of east Idaho, and for us to be able to continue to grow, offer new destinations to thousands of travelers and meet the community’s needs, this is a step in the right direction,” Turner said. 
Turner said he is grateful for the support of Simpson, local elected officials, the state and the Federal Aviation Administration. Without those partners, Turner said expanding the airport would not be possible.
The House Committee on Appropriations, which Simpson is a member of, approved the budget measure last month but the full U.S. House of Representatives has not yet voted on the proposal.
Congress is in recess now, and Turner said airport and city officials will wait for Congress to act before moving forward. 
“This is all up in the air until Congress passes a transportation, housing and urban development bill,” Turner said.

Article Summary

Police departments will be required to request detailed background history from past employers, who will be mandated to provide it.
The measure signed by Gov. JB Pritzker is in honor of Sonya Massey, a woman shot to death in her kitchen by a Sangamon County deputy in July 2024.
The deputy accused of murdering Massey pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to stand trial in October.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – Police agencies in Illinois will soon be required to do more thorough background checks on prospective officers.
The measure signed by Gov. JB Pritzker Tuesday came in response to the July 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey in Sangamon County by a sheriff’s deputy. Massey had called police to report a prowler and was in her home when she was shot to death by Deputy Sean Grayson while removing a pot of boiling water from the stove, with permission.
The signing came at the governor’s Capitol office, where he was flanked by members of Massey’s family, including daughter Jeanette “Summer” Massey, son Malachi Hill-Massey and mom Donna Massey, among others.

“I just want to say I miss my mom every day – like every day. And it hurts that she’s not here with me,” Massey’s son, Hill-Massey said at a news conference. “But I am very happy that we could also get a bill put in her name and her name could live on for forever.”
The shooting
Body camera video of Massey’s shooting showed Grayson moving toward Massey and threatening to shoot her in the face after she said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” She was holding the pot of water after deputies gave her permission to move it.
Shortly after the shooting, the video showed an officer asking Grayson if he was ok.
“Yeah, I’m ok. This f—ing b—h is crazy,” he responded. He told other officers at the scene, “She set it up on purpose, so it is what it is,” later adding he “didn’t have a choice.”
Grayson was fired from the sheriff’s office after the shooting. He pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges and is scheduled for trial in Peoria in October.
Sen. Doris Turner, D-Springfield, sponsored Senate Bill 1953, which requires the hiring department to obtain and review a person’s extensive background before making a job offer.
Turner said she’s a neighbor of the Massey family and Sonya visited her home a week before she was killed. Sponsoring the bill was the “least political thing” she’s done in her 25 years of elected office, she said.
“With Gov. Pritzker’s signature on this legislation today, I feel confident that going forward and over time, our communities and law enforcement will have built a trusting relationship, and I will have kept my promise to my childhood friends and Sonya’s mother,” Turner said.
Grayson’s record
Grayson’s employment record came under scrutiny after the shooting, including that he had worked for six departments in four years and had two convictions for driving under the influence.
Capitol News Illinois reporting at the time revealed that Grayson had a history of reprimands and disobeying superiors at departments that previously employed him.
Grayson’s file from the Logan County Sheriff’s Office showed he continued a high-speed pursuit of a traffic offender even after his supervisor ordered him to terminate it, a woman filed a complaint claiming Grayson tried to watch as she was strip searched, and her fiancé, who was in Logan County jail, claimed Grayson questioned him in front of other inmates as retaliation for his girlfriend’s complaint.
He was not fired from the department. Internal investigations were closed when he resigned in April 2023 before starting at Sangamon County in May 2023.
It’s unclear whether Sangamon County obtained full personnel records from Grayson’s former employers or interviewed his superiors prior to hiring him.
“I believe that Senate Bill 1953 goes a long way to prevent individuals with backgrounds such as Sean Grayson from ever becoming associated with law enforcement,” Turner said.
The new law
Under the new law, a police department or sheriff’s office making a hire would be required to request employment personnel files from the applicant’s previous employers, including other law enforcement agencies. The previous employer would be required to share the information within 14 days.
Law enforcement applicants would be required to sign a document authorizing the release of information, including military service records, police discipline databases, employment and criminal history, driving records, academic credentials, a credit check, and more.

Information provided is to be unredacted, except for data such as financial information and social security numbers. If the former employer denies a request, the prospective employer may ask a court to intervene and could be reimbursed for associated fees and costs.
The law specifically states that if an existing collective bargaining agreement conflicts with the law, the law will not supersede it. But once the law takes effect, no expiring collective bargaining agreement can be extended in a form that contradicts the law.
It also exempts any information if a state’s attorney in the county where the applicant was previously employed provides a written directive stating the previous employer is not legally authorized to provide it.
The measure takes effect Jan. 1, 2026. It passed 101-12 in the House and 56-0 in the Senate.

(Photo by Grace Deng/Washington State Standard)A man who was held in a federal detention facility after Whitefish police pulled him over for an allegedly faulty taillight in April has filed a lawsuit alleging racial profiling and a violation of his constitutional rights against the City of Whitefish, Whitefish Police Chief Bridger Kelch, and Officer Michael Hingiss, who conducted the traffic stop.
Beker Rengifo Del Castillo, 33, is a Venezuelan citizen who was leaving a job near Whitefish Lake on April 24 when Hingiss stopped him, according to the lawsuit, allegedly for a broken brake light. Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection, and Del Castillo was left in the custody of a Customs and Border Protection officer and subsequently taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, a “a horrific and traumatic experience,” according to court documents.
Whitefish City Attorney Angela Jacobs told the Daily Montanan in an email that the city cannot comment on active litigation.
The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court of Montana in Missoula. Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.
In the lawsuit, Del Castillo’s attorneys allege that Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection because Beker “only speaks Spanish” and Border Patrol may “want to check him,” despite Del Castillo providing “proof of his lawful presence in the United States in the form of his valid REAL ID compliant driver’s license.”
According to the complaint, Del Castillo entered the United States in July 2024 through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Del Castillo’s application for work authorization on July 23, 2024, and issued him a Social Security number.
Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars. According to the complaint, Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection “due to a language barrier,” but then left Del Castillo with a federal officer to “continue” the immigration investigation. The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.
“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.
Following his transfer to an ICE detention facility, Del Castillo was held until April 30, and then released with “no place to stay and no way to get home.”
“Because of this incident, (Del Castillo) is reluctant to leave his home and attempts to avoid all contact with law enforcement, fearing he will again be detained and incarcerated based on discrimination and without cause,” the complaint states. “(He) quit his jobs to avoid the risk of being racially profiled and incarcerated without basis while driving to and from work.”
According to the complaint, the Whitefish Police Department has a policy about immigration violations that Hingiss broke while detaining Del Castillo and calling Border Patrol. The policies include prohibiting officers from detaining “any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant;” and no one who is “otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status are unresolved.”
The policies, according to the lawsuit, also state that an officer must notify a supervisor when detaining someone for an immigration violation, and seek approval before conducting an arrest for an alleged immigration offense and before transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities.
During a Whitefish City Council meeting in May, Police Chief Kelch told councilors the city had policies that “that strictly prohibit biased-based policing and improper profiling,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. Kelch also stated that “we did not call Border Patrol for interpretation services.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)At 32,500 miles of track, the 176-year old company known now as Burlington Northern Santa Fe could run a railroad line around the earth and have room to spare.
What it cannot do, however, according to legislators, advocacy agencies, and small-town Montana mayors, is provide prompt responses when building near the railroad becomes unavoidable. They’ve complained of exorbitant prices for permits, wait times stretching months to receive communication from BNSF and inconsistency from one of the nation’s largest freight companies. The railroad company is also in a legal battle with a company laying hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable in the Treasure State.
BNSF owns nearly all the track in the state and splits a western U.S. railroad duopoly with Union Pacific, which checks in at 32,693 miles. A large chunk of the nation’s freight is moved by BNSF, which runs about 1,200 trains per day and earned nearly $7 billion in profit last year.
Easements — small tracts of land where someone has the right to cross or otherwise use someone else’s land for a specified purpose — and the railroad’s utility permit process have caught the attention of the legislature and the ire of some towns, from Thompson Falls to Colstrip.
Water lines, sewage lines, and fiber optic cables all sometimes need to be run under or near railroad tracks. Getting the proper permits for those can take months, stretching timelines and adding financial stress to cities, which in some cases are on deadlines to spend grant money or lose it.
Permitting is a complex process involving multiple companies doing work on behalf of BNSF, with a 52-page “Utility Accommodation Policy” spelling out the rules and regulations for anyone dealing with the railroad.
“BNSF’s utility permitting process is designed to ensure safety, protect private property rights, and recover the costs associated with managing infrastructure on active railroad property,” said Lena Kent, BNSF general director of public affairs said in a statement to the Daily Montanan. “While we recognize the importance of utility projects to local communities, each application must be evaluated based on its unique scope, complexity and associated risks.”
Buying or leasing easements includes expensive fees, too. Various pieces of legislation have looked to fix timelines and expenses, including House Bill 933 this year, with the legislature considering similar legislation again in the interim after it failed during the session. HB 933 was the resuscitation of legislation from 2019, which also did not pass. 
In the past, potential easement legislation has been used to bring parties to the table and come to a resolution over specific rail issues. It remains to be seen if that will be the case this time around, and Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, a Billings Republican who leads the Legislature’s Energy and Technology Interim Committee, has pursued the issue. 
“Ball’s in their court to act like adults,” Zolnikov said of BNSF. “Not children.”

The most recent chapter in the controversy over the BNSF easement permitting process broke out during a July 28 meeting of the Legislature’s Energy and Technology Interim Committee.
Montana League of Cities and Towns Executive Director Kelly Lynch, who said she’d never addressed the committee before, requested legislators look into the issue.
“I’m here before you today to ask that you look into an issue that’s been percolating for some years now,” Lynch said. “My members of cities and towns have been struggling for many years to get approval and get through the process of either doing a utility crossing or getting access to railroad property.”
Seconds after Lynch finished her public comment, though, BNSF supporters moved to defend the railroad. Negative experiences with the freight company are not universally shared in Montana.
Mark Lambrecht, CEO of the Montana Electric Cooperatives Association, addressed the committee, bringing up HB 933, which he opposed during a House Transportation committee meeting in late March. 
The Electrical Cooperatives Association was part of an agreement with BNSF in 2019, Lambrecht said, and in March he stated HB 933 would blow it up. He said they’ve been pleased with the agreement.
“There’s a permitting process and timelines, communication, standards, things like that,” Lambrecht told the interim committee on July 28. “That agreement has worked really, really well.”

Later in the meeting, committee members indicated they were interested in pursuing legislation around railroad easements. 
Matt Jones, a BNSF lobbyist, responded with phone calls to several cities around the state. What happened next is disputed.
In a July 29 email to Energy and Technology Interim Committee members, Zolnikov wrote the calls from Jones included “some threats.”
“From what I am being told, these threats include pulling current and or future easements. BNSF has allegedly stated it will be even worse for the cities if legislation is brought forward out of the committee,” Zolnikov wrote, saying it was ironic because, “This draft (bill) was brought forward to address the issue of non-cooperative entities slow rolling and overcharging our cities and other infrastructure developments.”
When reached by BNSF, a company spokesperson initially told the Daily Montanan their was, “overall concern in even proceeding with a story based on this state senator making this crazy, unfounded accusation that we’re threatening the communities we work with and serve.”
In an emailed response to Zolnikov and the committee, Jones said his phone calls weren’t threats. Multiple sources for this story expressed concern that cities with active BNSF projects would receive reprisal from the train company if they spoke publicly.
“I contacted a few cities where we have a lot of interaction on projects to ask them if this is an issue of such concern that they are asking for legislative involvement,” Jones wrote on July 30. “There were no threats made, and I emphasized the importance of working together for the long-term on a wide variety of projects, not just utility easements.”
Jones went on to write that legislation supported by the League of Cities during the legislative session — HB 933 — “wasn’t good for municipalities,” stating it would have led to higher costs for two projects that were “pending” at that time. It’s unclear what those projects were or who would benefit by killing HB 933, though Lambrecht said they were “industrial interests” who were having issues with a crossing during the July committee meeting. 
  Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka
When asked by the Daily Montanan, BNSF did not specify what deal was made and with whom, but did expand on its opposition to that proposed legislation. 
“BNSF opposed House Bill 933 because it proposed an unconstitutional infringement of private property interests,” Kent said in a statement. “It would result in the taking of private property without the due process guaranteed in the Montana and U.S. Constitutions.”
Rep. Neil Duram, a Eureka Republican who brought HB 933, told the Daily Montanan the railroad company then asked him to kill the bill, which was voted down in the House 100-0. It was similar to how it’s happened in the past and said he wants to be transparent on the issue.
Duram did say the “industrial interests” were concerned with a project near Thompson Falls.
“Each session the railroad gave concessions to the aggrieved party. They’ve made an agreement with the aggrieved party to contact their legislator and request that they pull the bill,” Duram said. “That’s how it’s happened each session.”

House Bill 933, also called the Montana Railroad Crossing Clarity Act, also is part of a legal battle between BNSF and a fiber optic company, Intermountain Infrastructure Group.
BNSF filed a lawsuit on May 15 against the fiber optic company, also known as IIG, saying it is trespassing on their land and has been doing so for a long time. IIG has been active near Thompson Falls.
The suit, which was filed in Missoula and includes a copy of the 1864 Northern Pacific Act, claims IIG “misrepresented and misled BNSF” as the fiber optic company was going through the permitting process for the contested easements. 
It said IIG laid cable on BNSF’s land “without notice and without permission.”
In its response, IIG — who is represented by Graybill Law Firm along with Parsons, Behle and Latimer — said BNSF was retaliating for support of HB 933. IIG eventually dropped its support for the legislation, apparently with the understanding the rail company would work with them.
BNSF, who is represented by Billings law firm Hedger Friend, PLLC, went to court instead.
“Directly following IIG’s advocacy at the Montana legislature, BNSF informed IIG for the first time that it intended to file a lawsuit to seek removal of the longitudinal lines that IIG had placed in good faith in public road rights-of-way that are the subject of this case,” the complaint response states.
IIG, beginning in 2023, started to obtain permits from various local and state jurisdictions for the cable. During that process, court documents state, IIG began to also ask BNSF for permits and was able to receive them. In response to certain applications, BNSF asked for additional information, including maps, which IIG gave. 
During study of those maps, BNSF began to assert IIG was trespassing on its right of way, but agreed to issue remedial permits. None of the cases in the suit involve IIG crossing the railroad, only being on their land, the complaint response said, adding IIG wasn’t causing any interference with BNSF operations.

“Most of the installations were and are on the opposite side of the highway from BNSF’s track—in other words, a public highway stands between IIG’s installation and BNSF’s track,” IIG argued in its response. “Most of the installations are in locations already occupied by other public and private utilities, in some cases pervasively occupied by other infrastructure.”
In January 2025, BNSF sent IIG a trespass letter, allegedly saying it was “just a formality.”
In response, IIG didn’t contest BNSF’s position on the permits and paid for them. One permit for approximately 1,800 feet of cable cost $236,438, court documents stated.
Following support for the bill, which came after the permit issues, “BNSF refused to continue processing any of IIG’s permits,” the complaint response states. 
Those aren’t just permits in Montana either; BNSF is allegedly holding up IIG permits in other states, too, according to court documents.
BNSF allegedly also told IIG that it was attacking the railroad industry.
“In an April email, BNSF’s current counsel informed IIG that it was ‘concerning’ to BNSF that ‘while BNSF was pursuing necessary internal approvals, IIG attempted to initiate legislative action against not only BNSF but the railroad industry as a whole,’” court documents state.
In a counterclaim response to IIG, BNSF said it doesn’t have any contracts with the fiber optic company.
“IIG’s breach of contract/breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim is barred because no contract was formed between BNSF and IIG,” court documents state. “The submission of a permit application does not constitute an enforceable contract obligating BNSF to issue a license.”
IIG was established in 2017 and has constructed about 800 miles of underground fiber optic cable in the state. 
IIG said it does not comment on pending litigation when reached. BNSF does not comment on active litigation either, a company spokesperson told the Daily Montanan.
Montana is investing heavily in fiber optic cable, to the tune of nearly a billion dollars between federal and state funding, according to the state’s broadband program website, ConnectMT. 
IIG does not directly have contacts with the state for work, a company spokesperson said, but is involved in upgrading Montana’s internet infrastructure.
Brandon Coates, a spokesperson for IIG, compared the process to road systems. What IIG is creating, he said, are essentially fiber optic interstates. Other fiber optic cable companies that do have ConnectMT contracts are creating highways to connect to IIG’s larger infrastructure, Coates added, including one Gov. Greg Gianforte highlighted recently in Whitehall.

Other disputes are taking place outside the courtroom and in small Montana cities.
One of those towns is Thompson Falls and a word Mayor Rusti Leivestad used to describe the railroad easement business was “frustrating.” 
The city is working on a new wastewater system, and a lift station is near a BNSF railroad. 
Leivestad said the city initially reached out to BNSF in February 2025 with its application and didn’t get a dollar figure until the end of May. 
The price was on the high side of what city officials were expecting.
“We were informed by BNSF that the permit fee would be $88,880 along with a list of insurance requirements,” Leivestad said. 
BNSF and the city eventually negotiated down the price, and Thompson Falls, population 1,526, was given two more options. This time the city could pay a company a little more than $20,000 in a one-time fee, or it could pay $1,500 a year with a 3% increase each year. Leviestad and her town chose the first option, with the second calculated to be almost double the lump sum amount.
The amount was far greater than what the city has paid in the past to another rail company, Montana Rail Link. BNSF announced in late 2023 that it was acquiring Montana Rail Link, adding to the more than 400 companies it has swallowed during the course of its history.
“The permit with (Montana Rail Link), who was the negotiating company for the first phase of our wastewater project, that permit was $925 and we paid $500 a year for the lease,” Leivestad added. “So that kind of gives you an example.”

Another example can be found in Colstrip.
Colstrip needed a new water line, Mayor John Williams said, and was on a time crunch to finish the project. Federal funds they needed for infrastructure projects would run out if they didn’t get the project completed in time.
The Colstrip project didn’t actually cross a railroad track, Williams said, and is in fact about 120 feet away from the ties. Delays were so worrisome that Colstrip didn’t really negotiate with BNSF, like Thompson Falls was able to do, Williams said.
“When we got the number, we attempted to find, you know, what’s the basis of this? Why is it so much?” Williams told the Daily Montanan. “The information that was transferred to me was that BNSF told our engineer that if we wanted to contact him and negotiate a different number or lesser number, the city would be welcome to do that. But at the time I was contracted, and we were up against it. I thought if we try to negotiate a lower cost, we may lose the contract.”
Colstrip ended up paying more than $41,000 for the permit, Williams said, which included insurance.

BNSF’s permitting website is run by Bartlett and West, and for the internet adept, it’s user friendly.
The website directs you to create an account, and you can immediately begin the process of filing a permit. There’s several types — pipeline and wire line have the same instructions, for example — and varying timelines. Oversized loads, road resurfacing and environmental work are other permits that can be applied for. They all require a $2,000 non-refundable application fee.
The website lays out specific process instructions for those seeking a permit.
“Permit costs and timelines vary because the projects are different in scope and complexity.  The property interests involved and associated risks have different values,” Kent said in a statement. “For example, a perpendicular wireline crossing of the railroad right of way is less burden to the landowner than a mile long installation of a gas or sewer line. BNSF understands utility projects are critical infrastructure, and it’s often not possible to avoid railroad property. As a result, we regularly work with applicants to negotiate fees that are less than fair market value. These negotiations often add time to the process.”

A pipeline, for example, requires an engineering review and drawings, which takes approximately two weeks to complete. At that point, the review process is handed off to JLL, a real estate company, who sends the contract along with directions on insurance and “any additional fees.”
That signed contract is then returned to JLL and following that step, the final contract is presented. The website says “the average time from successful submission of the application to execution of the license agreement is four weeks.”
Timelines get far longer and the process more complicated for private crossings. The permitting website says the average time from submission to execution is 10 weeks. Those permits involve working with the BNSF director of field safety, as well as a contract process with JLL. 
If it’s a new crossing, add even more time and work.
“If this is a new crossing, an estimate for BNSF’s labor/material costs for placement and (future) removal of the crossing materials will be prepared,” the website reads, which added that a new crossing adds at least a month to the timeline. “Typically, the grading/drainage work for the roadway from the right of way line to the crossing is performed by the licensee’s contractor.”
Before filing a permit, the website also asks the user to read the railroad’s Utility Accommodation Policy. It is deeply detailed, noting everything from hiring flaggers for the railroad to what construction techniques are allowed by the company to dig under a rail bed.
Insurance is also noted, with BNSF having absolutely no liability if anything goes wrong.
“The Utility Owner, its successor(s), or assignees shall assume all risk and liability for accidents and damages that may occur to persons or property on account of this work, and shall indemnify and hold BNSF harmless from any and all costs, liabilities, expenses, suits, judgments or damages to persons or property, or claims of any nature whatsoever, arising out of or in connection with the permit, or the operation and performance thereunder by the utility, its agents, employees or subcontractors,” the company document reads.
It even has separate sections of rules for utilities going parallel and perpendicular to the railroad’s property. Even those, though, as illustrated in IIG’s case, can be expensive and complicated.
In a statement, BNSF defended its process and provided statistics specific to the state.
“In 2024, BNSF received 168 applications for utility permits in Montana alone.  87% of permits were completed within 65 days,” Kent said. “Regarding cycle time, BNSF’s goal is to get a draft license to the applicant within 35 days from the time a complete application is received.  In Montana last year, we sent out a license agreement for utility permits in 10.25 days on average.”

Legislation could be coming next session on railroad easements and past attempts, as well a North Dakota law, could be a blueprint.
The North Dakota law, passed in 2019, dictates the process utilities and railroad companies most follow over easements. Much of the meat of the North Dakota law, including insurance requirements and other small processes, mirrors language on BNSF’s permitting website. 
The Public Service Commission is the body that regulates railroads in Montana. Lynch brought up both that and the North Dakota law during her public comment to the legislative committee.
In a comment to the Daily Montanan, she said cities and towns want a consistent process.
“That is, we know up front what’s going to be expected of us, how long it’s going to take and how much it’s gonna cost,” Lynch said. 
BNSF, in a statement to the Daily Montanan, said it “deeply values” the communities it operates in and serves.
“We regularly work with local municipalities on a number of issues, including various public projects and real estate transactions,” the BNSF statement said. “We stand ready to collaborate and find workable solutions that are agreeable to all parties involved.”
Proposed legislation in the past — including the 2025 Montana Railroad Crossing Clarity Act — would have set caps for permit costs and created legally enforceable timelines for project. HB 933, in fact, would have capped permit costs at whatever was greater, $3,000 or $10 for every linear foot of the railroad right-of-way occupied by the crossing.
Importantly, it also protected imminent domain rights. The bill also included stipulations on costs for flaggers and other administrative bits, including insurance costs.
There were philosophical concerns with the legislation, even for Duram, the bill’s sponsor.
“There really is no harm to the railroad, this is just an opportunity for them to make some more profits off the land that they own, which they’re entitled to,” Duram said. “And that’s always been kind of my tightrope, is respecting private property rights. At what point does the state step in and tell you what you’re going to charge for people to access?”
Frustration, however, seems to be mounting, and Zolnikov brought up another option the Legislature has, though one they could be hesitant to use.
“We can raise taxes, and I do not raise taxes,” Zolnikov said. “But if they are going to threaten to sue us on any solution to this problem and they’re going to keep strong-arming cities and towns, then we can solve this problem via taxation.”

A recent ruling sending the case back to the state’s environmental court extends a dozen-year limbo for the store, which its owner still hopes to reopen.

ST. ALBANS TOWN — Earlier this month, Janet Cote brought a pastor to her half-rebuilt store in St. Albans Town, where work halted in 2017. Inside the building’s bare bones, they prayed that after being closed for more than a dozen years, she could bring the store back to what it was. 
A freak accident involving a neighbor’s tractor initially caused the store to close for repairs in 2012. But soil contamination from underground oil tanks, which were found after the accident, started an extended limbo and legal battle over who should foot the whopping bill for remediation: Cote or the state. 
In late July, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled on the lawsuit against the state Agency of Natural Resources. Cote, who is 83, still hopes that after six years in the court system, winning the suit would put her on a path to reopening the store. 
“My mission and my purpose is to restore the business,” Cote said. 
There were gas pumps in front of Maquam Shore Market when Cote took over the one-acre property from her parents in 1982. She leased out the store, an apartment upstairs, a trailer hookup outside and two white houses closer to the lake. The store itself hosted a creemee window and a deli inside on the left as you walked in. Back then, the spot was mostly surrounded by cornfields. 
“It’s the only store within five miles in every direction, almost,” Cote said. 
In 2000, Cote decided to get rid of the gas pumps. 
So she hired a state-approved contractor with money from the Department of Environmental Conservation’s petroleum cleanup fund to dig up her pumps along with three underground oil and gas tanks. The department, which is part of the agency, pays for projects like Cote’s through fees on gas and oil sales and regulations designed to follow federal regulations to protect the environment and public health.

After digging up the tanks, Cote’s contractor had to monitor the soil. The contractor “told me that the levels of hazardous whatever were below what (was) needed to continue,” Cote said. 
In hindsight, that’s when the trouble began. But she didn’t know it until 2012, when her neighbor accidentally rammed into the building while driving a large tractor along Maquam Shore Road. The crash caused so much damage, it forced her to close the store. 
In the process of getting a permit to rebuild, she learned her soil was in fact contaminated, she said.
To clean up the spill, she had to dig up a large section of her property — meaning her repairs went far beyond recovering from the crash. She would have to dig up the store’s foundation, wastewater system and electrical wiring and then rebuild the structure completely. In the process, contractors who Cote found through the department discovered, and dug out, more gas tanks from more than a decade before. 
The price tag on the additional work is more than she can cover herself, she said — and she thinks the department should pay for it all. Destroying the store completely was the only way to remediate the soil, so in her eyes the state should pay the full cost to rebuild it. 
But it hasn’t been decided whether the state will pick up the tab. 
After years of back and forth, the agency agreed to pay for only some parts of restoring the property. So she took the agency to court back in 2019. 
On July 25, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled unanimously to send the case back to the environmental division, asking for additional factual findings from that court about why the department would cover some costs and not others. 
“We understand the Supreme Court’s decision to remand the case back to the Environmental Court for more specific findings, and we will continue to represent the Agency of Natural Resources in this matter. We are confident that the Agency correctly determined the covered costs,” said the Vermont Attorney General’s office, which is representing the agency, in an emailed statement. 
For now, Cote is celebrating what she sees as a win, though she still awaits the day the legal battle can be over. 
As a retired person, she spends a huge portion of her time and energy on the lawsuit, she said.

Back to environmental court
Emails from state officials obtained by Cote through a public records request and reviewed by VTDigger show that, throughout the years, department officials knew her soil was contaminated. However, she said, they never alerted her. 
In one email from March 2013, Matt Moran, who still manages the petroleum cleanup fund for the department, wrote that Cote was “uncooperative about doing the necessary follow-up work.” He later wrote, “the owner is older and likely will be needing to sell or transfer the property soon.” 
Cote called the emails derogatory and denies that she was ever uncooperative. She thinks the state is drawing things out because of her age, she said. 
Through a spokesperson, the Agency of Natural Resources denied Cote’s allegations of age discrimination by its staff.

“Thus far, these claims have been determined to be without merit,” said agency spokesperson Stephanie Brackin. “Should Ms. Cote present any credible new evidence of misconduct by a state employee, we will review the information.”
The work has been expensive. By 2018, the state had spent more than $485,000 on her property from the state’s petroleum cleanup fund, according to court documents. After going back and forth, department officials asked Cote to send over a list of the remaining repairs. 
In 2019, they declined to cover many of those requested repairs, including on the wastewater system, work on the electrical system, concrete work and the price of hiring a general contractor. So Cote sued, arguing her costs should be covered in full. 
The case was tossed around and then put on pause for years during the pandemic. 
Then, in 2024, Environmental Court Judge Thomas Durkin reversed some of the agency’s decisions in favor of Cote. Durkin ruled that the state had to pay for concrete, wastewater and electrical work. But he allowed the agency to reject a range of other costs, some significant and others less so, from hiring a general contractor to repairing a flagpole. 
Those costs added up to at least tens of thousands of dollars that Cote did not have, she said, so she appealed the court decision.
This summer, she said she got what she was hoping for. 
All five justices reversed the part of the lower court ruling that accepted the department’s argument that the petroleum cleanup fund was not responsible for the additional costs, and passed the case back. 
In the ruling, justices reasoned that the lower court ruling did not include findings about the agency’s justification for why they would cover some costs and not others. Justices also found the lower court failed to thoroughly define what was considered a reasonable expense or how they interpreted the law. 
The language used in the lower court’s decision “forces us to speculate about whether and how each item is ineligible according to the agency,” justices wrote in the decision.
Now, the case must be passed back down to the environmental court where judges will revisit it and will issue new or additional findings, bearing in mind the legal interpretation offered by the Vermont Supreme Court. 
While Cote said she is grateful for the ruling, she’s dismayed by how long the whole process has taken. “I am not grateful that I have to keep litigating because of things that were not correct,” Cote said. 
On an August afternoon, only the skeleton of the prospective store stood in the old one’s footprint. Its red siding covered half the building. Cote stood out front and looked up at the building’s side as it cast a shadow over her.

[…]","Dozens of people packed into a room at Northwood Technical College in Ashland for the first day of hearings in a case challenging the DNR's decision to approve a permit for the reroute of the Line 5 oil pipeline. (Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)In more than five hours of public testimony on Tuesday in Ashland, the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s case began against a planned extension of the Canadian energy company Enbridge’s Line 5 oil pipeline through northern Wisconsin. 
For decades, Line 5 has run from Canada across northern Wisconsin, through the Bad River reservation. In 2023 a federal judge ordered that the pipeline’s section on the reservation be shut down. Since 2020, Enbridge has been working on a plan to reroute the pipeline, which runs from far northwest Wisconsin 645 miles into Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, under the Straits of Mackinac and across the U.S. border into Canada near Detroit. It transports about 23 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids daily.
The proposed new route would move the pipeline upstream of the reservation, which tribal members have argued doesn’t alleviate the environmental risks the pipeline poses to them. 
Tuesday’s hearing was the opening day of testimony in the tribe’s case against the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ decision to grant permits for the Line 5 reroute. The case was argued before the Wisconsin Department of Administration’s Division of Hearings and Appeals, which gives parties the ability to challenge regulatory decisions by state agencies. Four weeks of hearings are scheduled in both Ashland and Madison. The final decision by DHA can be appealed to a state circuit court. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also weighing its own permit decision on the reroute. That decision is appealable through the federal court system. 
Before the hearing started Tuesday a line of people wound through the parking lot of Northwood Technical College. At the start of the day, the hearing room was packed, with an overflow crowd  forced to watch a livestream from an auxiliary room. 
Many of the people in attendance wore t-shirts stating “Support Line 5” or representing area unions. Tribal activists grumbled that Enbridge had chartered a bus to bring in supporters. 
The pipeline reroute has already sparked hours of public comment and thousands of written comments. The DNR’s initial permit decision drew more than 32,000 written comments and an Army Corps of Engineers hearing on its permit decision in May drew two days of additional public input. 
The day began with opening statements from the tribe’s attorneys, Clean Wisconsin — a non-profit environmental organization which has intervened in the case — and the DNR. 
DNR attorney Michael Kowalkowski said that the department is confident the project will not result in “adverse” effects to the environment or local water after one of the “most comprehensive environmental reviews” in agency history. 
But Stefanie Tsosie, an attorney for the tribe, said the proposed reroute “is not a solution.” She noted that the hearings were occurring as the wild rice harvesting season in the region begins. Wild rice is an important piece of the tribe’s culture and the wetland habitats the rice is a part of are a crucial layer of defense for the area’s waterways — including Lake Superior — against pollution from runoff and flooding. Tsosie said any errors in construction or accidents after the pipeline is operational could irreversibly damage the wild rice. 
“The band is here taking a stand,” Tsosie said, because if an oil spill occurs and the environment is harmed, “the band has nowhere else to go.”

Evan Feinauer, an attorney for Clean Wisconsin, said the project poses far too much environmental risk for the DNR’s permit approval to stand, adding that a “spill of any meaningful size would be catastrophic” to the Lake Superior watershed. 
While many opponents of Line 5 did testify, a large majority of the comments came from supporters of the project. Supporters of the project argued that they believe Enbridge’s plans do enough to protect the environment while providing an economic boost to the region and hundreds of construction jobs. 
Even though the pipeline carries oil and natural gas from Canada through the U.S. and back into Canada, many area residents testified that shutting down the pipeline could raise their own energy prices and make it harder to obtain the propane they use to heat their homes. 
The project “will generate direct economic activity, it will create 700 union construction jobs, stimulate local spending and provide contracts for businesses,” said Anna Rademacher, a representative of the regional economic development organization Area Partnership for Economic Expansion.
While the hearing Tuesday drew hours of public testimony, the meat of the case is yet to come with the parties bringing their arguments for and against the DNR’s permit decision in later court dates. 
After the hearing, Tsosie told the Wisconsin Examiner the hearings Tuesday were a good baseline before the substantive parts of the case are heard.
“Obviously this is still really a contentious issue,” she said. “There are people who we saw today speak very passionately about protecting the water resources and protecting the area, and we saw people who we’ve seen before talk about the economic impacts. But this proceeding, the contested case proceeding, we’re really looking at the permit details, we’re looking at the evidence, we’re looking at baseline data, and so I think this is a good setup, but we still have four weeks of the case left.”
The case is set to continue in Madison Sept. 3 with additional public testimony. The beginning of the parties’ arguments is scheduled to begin Sept. 4.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0299-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 18:57:33.752019

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rescinded its previous decision to add seven segments to Iowa’s list of impaired waters due to their high nitrate concentrations. 
In November the agency decided the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ list of impaired waters only “partially” met the requirements of the Clean Water Act to identify waterways with identified pollutants in excess of water quality standards. 
The EPA review of the list identified seven additional segments with high levels of nitrate and nitrate plus nitrite. Despite pushback from the DNR, and comments that the EPA had a “patchwork approach” to regulating nitrate across the country, the federal agency finalized the decision in January. 
According to reporting from the Des Moines Register on Tuesday, the EPA office informed the DNR in July it had rescinded its decision. A spokesperson for the DNR confirmed the action in an email with the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

The original decision highlighted segments of rivers connected to municipal drinking water sources, including segments in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers which supply water to the Des Moines metro, the Cedar River upstream of Cedar Rapids, the Iowa River near Iowa City and the South Skunk River. 
EPA said in its November 2024 decision the nitrate concentrations in these segments exceeded safe drinking water standards. 
The DNR’s director, Kayla Lyon, pushed back against the decision saying the cities that source water from these rivers are all able to supply drinking water within the safe drinking water standards. Lyon also said the agency was “holding Iowa to a very high standard that it does not enforce elsewhere.” 
Nitrate concentrations have been a topic of interest for many in central Iowa this summer. In June, Central Iowa Water Works issued its first ever lawn watering ban to account for high nitrate concentrations in source waters, the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, and to continue to meet demand. 
The regional water authority kept nitrate concentrations in finished water below the EPA’s drinking water standards thanks to the ban, which was lifted Aug. 7, and to nitrate removal systems at several facilities. 
Data analysis: How do nitrate levels in central Iowa this year compare to last?

Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Board president Jenny Turner said the EPA’s decision to rescind the segments from the list was “an affront to the health and well-being of Iowans.” 
“Issuing this reversal on the heels of Central Iowa Water Works first ever lawn watering ban and consistently high nitrate levels in these very same water segments is tone deaf, appalling, and dangerous,” Turner said in a statement. 
The release of Polk County’s two-year water quality study has also brought the issue to the forefront for many Iowans. A widely attended presentation on the report has been viewed more than 2,000 times online, and at the event, researchers called for regulation on the agriculture industry for its links to nitrate pollution, which the study highlighted.
Tarah Heinzen, the legal director with the environmental group Food & Water Watch said the “water crisis” in Iowa should be a “call to action.” 
“Instead, Trump’s EPA is callously turning its back,” Heinzen said in a statement. “The data is clearer than ever that central Iowa is facing persistent, toxic nitrate contamination endangering thousands — and industrial agriculture is responsible.”

The Rx Kids program opened enrollment in 2024 in an effort to combat childhood poverty and improve infant and maternal health in the city of Flint. However, the program has since expanded to offer cash-based assistance to parents of babies in Kalamazoo and Pontiac as well as Alger, Clare, Chippewa, Luce, Mackinac and Schoolcraft counties. 
Now, members of the Legislature are aiming to expand the program to the entire state. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Sen. Sylvia Santana’s (D-Detroit) Senate Bill 309 would amend the state’s Social Welfare Act, requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to contract with Michigan State University to administer the program, which offers pregnant parents within a set area $1,500 during pregnancy and babies $500 a month for either the first six or 12 months of their life.
“This cash assistance helps remove economic barriers that often prevent families from obtaining necessary items, such as baby supplies, food, rent, utility bills and clothing,” Santana said.
Mona Hanna, the program’s director, explained that while the program in Michigan is the first of its kind in the nation, it’s not a new concept, with 70% of countries across the globe offering some kind of child/family allowance.
The early months of a child’s life is crucial in development, Hanna said, noting that a child’s brain doubles in size over the first year of their life. 
This is also a period when stress and scarcity can have lifelong impacts on a child, Hanna explained, with families also facing their steepest costs during this timeframe.

These costs are compounded by a loss of income if the mother has to leave the workforce and the added cost of caregiving and childcare, Hanna said, with individuals living in poor communities facing an even greater burden from these challenges. 
To date, the program has prescribed over $13 million dollars to more than 3,000 Michigan families, Hanna said, with the program financed through a combination of funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and municipalities, alongside other public-private support. 
“That means that every state dollar is matched and often multiplied by private investment, stretching our public resources further and maximizing impact,” Hanna said.
The most common item Rx Kids recipients spent their cash prescription on was baby supplies, namely diapers, Hanna said. 
Additionally families in the program reported less back-owed rent and mortgage payments, alongside improved nutrition security, and improved health benefits, Hanna said. 
“We are seeing a significant reduction in postpartum depression, a reduction in anxiety and a significant reduction in parental stress. We have a massive increase in prenatal care utilization. Moms are going to prenatal care earlier, they’re going more often,” Hanna said. “Because they’re going earlier and more often, we’re increasing the detection of pregnancy illnesses like gestational diabetes and hypertension. We have less smoking [in] the third trimester, and we are also seeing significant improvements in birth weight and gestational age.”
Hanna said that has resulted in fewer admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit.
During the hearing, Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) offered effusive praise for the program, noting that part of the region he represents is participating in Rx Kids . 
“I love that there are no strings attached, that you’re actually trusting that parents are going to use this for the right things, that those maternal and paternal instincts kick in and they use it for that,” Damoose said. “You don’t have means testing, which I think is a great thing, because there’s no stigma now. Everybody can go get this. It’s also helped you to lead to a tremendously low overhead, unlike so many sort of relief programs out there.”

Alongside praise from Damoose, two mothers who had participated in the program shared how their participation had offered greater stability. 
Quianna Jenkins had her first child at 18 years old. Despite stepping into motherhood young, Jenkins said she was determined to give her children the best life she could, though it hasn’t been easy. 
“There have been days filled with uncertainty, stress and sacrifice. From doctor visits to late night feedings to budgeting every single dollar just to make sure there’s enough to get through the week, it’s a lot.… That’s why, when I heard about the program, it felt like someone finally said, ‘we see you, we believe in you,’” Jenkins said. 
Those dollars have been instrumental in providing her kids with a better quality of life, Jenkins said, using the money to start a life insurance policy, something she never thought she’d be able to afford. 
Additionally, the cash benefit gives participants the ability to handle real life as it comes, treating recipients like the capable adults they are, Jenkins said. 
Celeste Lord-Timlin said she and her husband were both living in affordable housing when she found out she was pregnant.
Lord-Timlin was also pursuing two Masters degrees at the University of Michigan-Flint, opting to reduce her class schedule to remain in good standing. However, that decision led to the loss of her FAFSA eligibility, creating stress as she thought about her upcoming hospital bill alongside having to pay tuition out of pocket. 
“This is, again, where Rx Kids stepped in. That initial $1,500 payment was a lifeline. Half went to essential baby items, like a stroller and a car seat, and the other half covered my part-time tuition, allowing me to remain in good standing,” Lord-Timlin said. 
Now that they are off the program the $500 a month payments for her daughter has put them in a much better position by giving them a year to prepare, Lord-Timlin said.

While other working moms sometimes have to leave the workforce when childcare costs outweigh their salary, Lord-Timlin said the money from Rx Kids gave her a buffer so she could remain in the workforce. 
“This past June, I proudly received my Masters in organizational leadership and I’m on track to receive my [Masters of Business Administration] this December,” Lord-Timlin said. “It’s more than just cash, it’s an investment in the potential of mothers, the stability of families and the futures of communities.”

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) It’s been more than a month since attorneys for Ralph Menzies asked a Utah court to conduct another evaluation into whether the 67-year-old death row inmate with dementia is mentally fit enough to be executed. 
Now, with his firing squad execution less than four weeks away, his attorneys have asked a judge to speed up his ruling, worried that any further delay could impact Menzies’ due process. On Monday, they filed a motion requesting Utah 3rd District Court Judge Matthew Bates expedite his decision. 
Menzies is appealing a prior court decision with the Utah Supreme Court, and the judge’s delay, his attorneys write, “could effectively deny Mr. Menzies his due process right.” 
Menzies has been on death row since 1988, after being convicted of kidnapping and murdering Maurine Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk who he took up Big Cottonwood Canyon. She was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.
Menzies’ dementia — and whether his condition deems him ineligible for execution — has been the subject of debate over the last year. Both state and federal law require that death row inmates have an understanding of why they’re being executed. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After hearing from several medical professionals who examined Menzies, Bates ruled in May that the inmate does have dementia, but still understands the state’s reasoning for executing him. That ruling allowed the Utah Attorney General’s Office to apply for an execution warrant which Bates signed, setting a Sept. 5 date for Menzies’ death by firing squad. 
Menzies’ attorneys promptly appealed the decision with the Utah Supreme Court and a hearing is set for Aug. 21.  
However, the evaluations Bates based his ruling off of happened about a year ago, and in that time, Menzies’ attorneys say his dementia has progressed. They believe that he now meets the level to be considered incompetent. 
In a petition filed on July 7, they asked Bates to grant Menzies another evaluation from a Utah Department of Health and Human Services doctor. If granted, that would kick off a 60-day process where the doctor examines the inmate and compiles a report for the court — depending on the report’s findings, Menzies could be found incompetent, and spared from execution.
They also asked the court to pause execution proceedings to give the appeal time to play out, which Bates denied. 
‘Time is ticking’: Judge to decide whether Ralph Menzies should get another review before execution

On July 23, after hearing arguments for and against granting another competency evaluation, Bates said he would grant a ruling “as quickly as possible.” That was 20 days ago, as of Tuesday, and the petition itself was filed 37 days ago. 
“Mr. Menzies’s petition was pending when the Court issued a warrant of execution set for 58 days from its issuance. More than half of that time has now elapsed without a ruling,” court documents read. “This delay underscores precisely why a stay was necessary pending resolution of the petition.”
If Bates intends to deny Menzies another competency evaluation, his attorneys are asking for a ruling to be issued immediately so they can file an appeal. 
His attorneys also say any further delay could complicate their appeal with the Utah Supreme Court, and his upcoming commutation hearing with the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole, scheduled to begin Wednesday. 
“Because that oral argument is scheduled for ten days from today, if this Court denies the Petition to Reevaluate Competency, there will likely be insufficient time for briefing and argument before the Supreme Court on that date. Such a delay could effectively deny Mr. Menzies his due process right to adequate review,” the motion, filed on Monday, reads.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A total of 39 North Dakotans applied to fill the open positions to the Ethics Commission.
The applicant pool includes former Ethics Commission Chair Paul Richard, who was among the first crop of commissioners to serve on the board. Richard stepped down last year after five years of service.
He said he applied to finish the term of former chair Dave Anderson, who died unexpectedly in May. Anderson was also one of the first members of the commission. Richard said he could help fill in the experience gap that Anderson leaves behind.
“At the end of the day, I’m available if they want me,” he said.
Other applicants include attorneys, former state and local government employees, professors, community organizers and a former Ethics Commission intern.
Whoever fills Anderson’s seat would begin as soon as possible and finish out his term, which ends Aug. 31, 2026.
Another opening is for Ward Koeser’s seat. Koeser will leave the commission at the end of August, and his successor will serve a four-year term beginning Sept. 1.
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen’s term also ends this month, though he is seeking to be reappointed. The Ethics Commission sent a letter to the Governor’s Office expressing support for Sagsveen’s reappointment.
Members of the Ethics Commission are selected based on a consensus vote of the governor and the Senate majority and minority leaders.
The appointments come at a time when the governor and Ethics Commission have been openly at odds over the role of the regulatory agency.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

The three officials will convene at 10 a.m. Friday at the Capitol to begin reviewing applications.
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. It’s tasked with enforcing ethical behavior in the areas of elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency.
Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Rep. Josh Turek announced his campaign for U.S. Senate Tuesday, becoming the fifth Democrat running for the seat currently held by Sen. Joni Ernst.
Turek, 46, launched his campaign with a video titled “Underdog,” where he shared his experience on the path to become a two-time Paralympic gold medalist. The Council Bluffs native, who was born with spina bifida and uses a wheelchair, said his family got assistance from Iowa’s free summer lunch program and Area Education Agencies as he was growing up.
“I knew nothing would come easy, but I never doubted my right to the American dream,” Turek said in the video. “Sitting in my wheelchair nine years old, watching the Olympics, I dreamed of winning gold for my country, too. In 2016 I did just that.”
After his 2016 and 2020 wins on the U.S. wheelchair basketball team for the Paralympic Games, Turek won election to represent Iowa House District 20 in the 2022 election by a margin of 6 votes after a recount. He won reelection in the 2024 election by 5% against his Republican challenger.
Turek said his wins in the Paralympics and in politics have come from support through the AEAs and other state programs, as well as his father’s Veterans Affairs health coverage. He cited former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin as a figure in Iowa politics who “made sure that the doors were open for kids like me” — but said Iowa’s current representation in Washington is “just closing doors.”
Ernst is putting programs and services at risk that supported his family growing up, Turek said. He pointing to her comment, “Well, we all are going to die,” at a May town hall responding to a person criticizing the Medicaid cuts included in the GOP budget reconciliation bill.
In a statement on his campaign launch, Turek said he wants to support farms and small businesses and focus on bringing down the cost of health care, prescription drugs and housing.
“Instead of cutting Medicaid for thousands of Iowans, we should make it easier for people to afford health care and address the growing rates of cancer,” Turek said. “Joni Ernst went to Washington and forgot about fighting for us. Now she’s helping her party make life worse for working people while the wealthy and big corporations thrive. I’m running for Senate to stick up for Iowans, not billionaires.”
Ernst has not said if she plans to run for another term in the 2026 election, though on Sunday she told reporters at the Iowa State Fair Sunday an announcement will be “coming soon.” Though not officially in the race, Ernst has support from GOP Senate leadership to run again, and has hired a campaign manager.
Turek must also compete with a field of Democratic candidates who are vying to become the party nominee in the midterms. Fellow state legislators Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville; state Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, are running for the seat, as are Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage. There are also two Republicans running in the primary to challenge Ernst — Jim Carlin, a former state lawmaker, and Joshua Smith, who has previously run for public office as a Libertarian.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/turek3.18.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-12 17:57:29.799477

 “We will be looking overnight at our storage capacity and how we’re trending and we’ll have an update tomorrow morning,” a public works official said.

Burlington officials continue to monitor water levels after the city issued its first water conservation notice this year asking residents to “limit non-essential water usage” and “delay other important water-intensive tasks.”
Sent by email and posted online, the alert went out Tuesday after the water in a Colchester tank fell 2 feet below the minimum desired water level by midday, according to Chapin Spencer, the city’s director of public works.
While that may not sound like a lot, Spencer said it is important to maintain high levels in the water tanks because the 7 million gallon reservoir and its tanks serve the University of Vermont and UVM Medical Center’s Level 1 trauma center — in addition to other city residents and businesses. 
“So we clearly need to make sure we’re able to serve any fire or emergency,” he said.
To that end, the alert asks residents in Burlington and Colchester to help conserve water by delaying outdoor watering, turning off taps and reducing the time of showers, dish washing and teeth brushing. It also asks users to delay laundry and dishwashing until a full load can be run, and to avoid peak times: after 8 p.m. and before 6 a.m.
The advisory applies to customers who receive a water bill from Burlington Water Resources or Colchester Fire District 2, which the city also serves. The reservoir and tanks serve about 10,000 customers in Burlington and about 2,800 in Malletts Bay.
The water level dropped because people use more water during heat waves and because the aging pumps that supply a water tower in Colchester stopped functioning Tuesday morning, according to Spencer.
“We did an emergency repair on one and so the water tower level is going back up in Colchester, but our ability to fully fill both the water tower and our reservoir are dependent on people not using as much water,” he said.
Burlington’s water infrastructure is aging and the two pumps that failed are about 25 years old, he said. One has been repaired and the department is working to fix the second one. There is no estimate of how long the advisory will be in place and the department will continue to monitor water levels daily.
“We will be looking overnight at our storage capacity and how we’re trending and we’ll have an update tomorrow morning,” Spencer said. “The best place to check, besides social media, is our website.”
Failing pumps and water conservation alerts are not common. In his 12 years, Spencer said Tuesday’s alert is the first time the city has issued a water conservation notice during peak summer.
Residents have reached out with queries but have mostly been understanding, he added.
“We have a great customer base. I think everybody understands intuitively that when there’s a heat wave like this that our water system is stressed,” he said.

Josh Shapiro nominated Carrie Rowe on Feb. 18 to serve as Pennsylvania's secretary of education. (Photo courtesy of www.pa.gov)State acting Education Secretary Carrie Rowe’s nomination has cleared a key legislative panel.
Rowe, who was nominated to serve as the acting secretary by Gov. Josh Shapiro in February, was unanimously approved by the state Senate Education Committee during a vote on Tuesday afternoon.
“I do believe that education is a powerful equalizer when it is accessible, just, and shaped by individuals who understand the many needs that students face,” Rowe said during the committee meeting. “And I look forward to working with you to give every student the opportunity to succeed and to chart their own course as we make Pennsylvania a leader in public education.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Rowe, a product of Pennsylvania public schools and universities, has worked her way up through the public school ranks in the state over the past 25 years. She started her career as a Spanish teacher in the Pittsburgh Public School District and later served as the superintendent of the Beaver Area School District.
Before taking over as acting secretary, Rowe served as the deputy secretary of elementary and secondary education at the department.
Sen. Dawn Keefer (R-York), who delivered introductory remarks for Rowe during the committee meeting, said the acting secretary’s work has included oversight of initiatives related to structured literacy, workforce readiness, teacher recruitment and retention, and student mental health.
“Over more than two decades, as was previewed for you, I have gone through everything from being a Spanish teacher in an urban location and a suburban location, being a principal in a middle school, a superintendent, deputy secretary, and so many things in between that have kind of brought me to this moment,” Rowe said. “Each of those things allows me to come to this moment with a desire to bridge policy and the practice that our teachers need every day in the classroom.”
If confirmed, Rowe said her top priorities are structured literacy and student safety.

“Expanding free school meals, strengthening college and career pathways and ensuring transparency to meet the needs of our students would certainly be additional things that I would want to focus on,” she added.
The next hurdle for Rowe’s nomination will be the Senate Rules and Executive Nominations Committee, a spokesperson from Sen. Lynda Schlegel Culver’s office told the Capital-Star on Tuesday afternoon. If the panel advances the nomination, it will go to the full Senate for a vote to formally confirm her to the position.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Months after its introduction and amidst scrutiny into Iowa universities’ compliance with anti-diversity, equity and inclusion policies, the Iowa Board of Regents has revised its academic freedom policies to include caveats on how certain topics can be taught.
The Iowa Board of Regents approved changes Tuesday to its policies relating to academic freedom and treatment of syllabi to include sections about “controversial subjects” and how they should be treated by faculty and students.
Under the new policy, faculty are allowed to teach controversial topics as long as they are connected to course content and taught in a way that “fosters critical thinking and avoids indoctrination of one perspective.” Instruction must also reflect debate on the topic and different scholarly views.
Board President Sherry Bates said during Tuesday’s meeting the new policy demonstrates a more comprehensive approach to ensuring academic freedom and protection from indoctrination, something board members asked for when discussing previously proposed policy. However, if word comes that the policy is not being followed, Bates said, the board will conduct an audit into the incident and take action if necessary.
“If the board office audit determines the policy is not being followed, I will not be passive in addressing the problem. I will set up a task force of board members to correct the situation and ensure compliance with the policy,” Bates said. “Ensuring that our students can learn and think for themselves is paramount to our mission.”

Another approved policy change added language to the board’s rules on syllabi posting that requires students’ grades be determined by their understanding and application of course content rather than their perspective on viewpoints expressed in the class.
Big differences between first, final policies
A first — and very different — draft of the policy changes was introduced at the board’s June meeting, where it was met with upset from students, staff, members of the public and lawmakers.
Universities would have been restricted from requiring students to take courses with “substantial content that conveys DEI or CRT” under the original policy draft, which critics called unlawful censorship of classroom instruction. Regent David Barker said during the June meeting he believed the policy was an “important first step” in eliminating distrust in higher education and ensuring students wouldn’t be taught opinions or controversial ideas as fact.
After deciding to slow down the process of approving the policy at its June meeting and once again delaying the decision in July, the board released a draft of the new policy proposal last week.
Barker said Tuesday he believes the policy proposal was improved by the removal of references to diversity, equity and inclusion and critical race theory, and that the latter subject is an academic area that has its place in certain classes.
“The point of this policy is to teach things in a balanced manner,” Barker said. “If some controversial policy is taught, students should be informed that this is controversial and they should have an understanding of both sides of it. But this policy is not about censoring. It’s not about saying there is anything that shouldn’t be taught.”
An amendment Barker introduced to include language stating “students shall have access to a clear, confidential and timely process to report concerns that instruction is not meeting these standards.” Also included in the amendment was the requirement that colleges investigate complaints, “promptly” report them to the board and “take corrective action when warranted.”
Barker brought up multiple videos that have surfaced in past weeks appearing to show officials at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University discussing anti-DEI laws and policies. Barker said while people are in disagreement about what these videos show, they are proof that, “at least until very recently,” campus culture was against state and federal law. This culture may have impacted students’ trust in current complaint processes, he said, and the board should create another.
Provosts at each state university said during the meeting they have complaint processes in place that are reviewed annually, and have students bring their concerns to the faculty in question before moving up the ladder.
Rachel Boon, chief academic officer with the board of regents, said the board office also has its own complaint process for those with First Amendment concerns that goes directly to Executive Director Mark Braun. Both Boon and Braun are also working to compile and review each of the universities’ avenues for filing a complaint to see whether they meet board standards and expectations, she said.
The amendment failed, with only Barker and Regent Christine Hensley voting in favor.
Regents express feelings on academic freedom
Regent Robert Cramer during the meeting said it is his “personal belief” that DEI and CRT topics shouldn’t be taught in classrooms because it is unhelpful to students who should be told their progress was due to their merit and not other reasons. Schools should look at individuals and “treat them all the same and give them that equal chance” to succeed, Cramer said, no matter their race or where they came from.
“My personal belief is that we don’t want, I wouldn’t — I don’t want any of the DEI, CRT, woke left stuff, you know, being taught in our classes,” Cramer said. “But I understand the difficulty of trying to, from the outside, trying to dictate what’s being taught, and I think we do believe in academic freedom, and, of course, freedom of speech. So I think addressing how things are taught is the right path.”
Regent Nancy Dunkel, the only board member to vote against approving the new policy, said with its passage, the “academic freedom” section of the board’s policy manual should be changed to “restrictions to academic freedom.”
The revisions suggested in the proposed policy are limitations on academic freedom rather than clarifications, Dunkel said, and include vague terms like “controversial” with no language saying how controversial content is deemed so, or who makes the decision. As one faculty member put in their email to Dunkel, she said, would this policy mean that professors must teach anti-capitalist theory in economics and anti-evolution arguments in biology, or even “present both sides of the Holocaust?”
“I want to uphold our present academic freedom policy, especially 3.10-F, which says, ‘Regent universities shall not be or become an instrument of partisan political action,’” Dunkel said. “The expression of partisan political opinions and viewpoints shall be those of individuals, not institutions, because the official adoption of any political position, whether favored by a majority or a minority, tends to substitute biased information that hinders the continuing search for truth.”

,DC,2025-08-12 21:25:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump’s mass deportations opened the door for deploying National Guard in D.C.,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-mass-deportations-opened-door-deploying-national-guard-dc,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s move to deploy 800 National Guard members in the District of Columbia over claims that crime is plaguing the city – despite historic lows –  follows his use of the military in his administration's growing immigration crackdown.“(D.C.’s) out of control, but we're going to put it in control very quickly, like we did on the southern border,” Trump said at a Monday press conference where he was flanked by members of his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He vowed to do the same in more cities governed by Democrats.Trump’s return to the White House was led by a campaign promise of mass deportations, tying newly arrived immigrants at the southern border with high crime rates and the need to use troops to detain and remove those migrants.Since Inauguration Day, the president has sent thousands of National Guard members to be stationed at the U.S.-Mexico border and has militarized strips of land along the border, putting migrants into contact with military personnel.Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard in June in response to unrest over immigration raids was seen as a test case for use of the state-based military forces. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California wrote on X on Monday that Trump “was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles” with that order.“He will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America,” Newsom said. “This is what dictators do.”‘Quick Reaction Force’Now the Trump administration is evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of 600 National Guard members to remain on stand-by in order to be quickly deployed to any U.S. city undergoing a protest or other civil unrest within an hour, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.The groups, who would be armed with riot gear and other weapons, would be split evenly between Alabama and Arizona, according to the Post.The DOD proposal also calls for a rotation of service members from Army and Air Force National Guard units based in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to the Post.National Guard members are typically in reserve and are some of the first responders to natural disasters.The Department of Defense and the National Guard did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment about the “Quick Reaction Force” plans. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Which cities are next?At the Monday press conference, Trump specifically cited four cities that could see similar National Guard movements: Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – all heavily Democratic cities led by Black mayors. Violent crime in all those cities has continued to trend downward, according to each city's police database.Baltimore County, Maryland, Cook County, Illinois, New York City and the entire state of California also all are on a new “sanctuary jurisdiction” list issued by the Department of Justice on Aug. 5. They are identified as “having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”But, unlike the district, where the president has control over the National Guard, state governors, under the law, have had control over their National Guard members.Additionally, while Trump has seized control of the 3,400 officers in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department for 29 days due to the district's Home Rule Act, experts don’t see how that can legally be done with other local police departments.“What they are doing in D.C. cannot be replicated outside of D.C. All of this is only possible because D.C. is not a state,” said Joseph Nunn, a counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program. “There's no playbook for them to do what they seem to want to do outside of D.C.”

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Trump’s statements about sending in National Guard members into cities.“The president is speaking about what he’d like to see take place in other cities across the country,” she said. “When the time comes we’ll talk about that. Starting with our nation's capital is a great place to begin and it should serve as a model.”Trump said he hoped other cities were “watching.”“Maybe they’ll self clean up and maybe they'll self do this and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all of the things that caused the problem,” the president said.Nunn said that even if the president were to federalize a state’s National Guard, those members would be subject to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.“There is no statutory exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that allows the military to participate in local law enforcement,” Nunn said.Los AngelesA trial is underway this week challenging the president’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Newsom, after an appeals court temporarily upheld Trump’s move.The president deployed 4,000 members of the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles after protests erupted against aggressive immigration actions by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting raids in Home Depot parking lots.But the legal issue before a San Francisco court is not if the president’s actions were unlawful, but on the political question of who has authority over the National Guard.Other governors in the states Trump mentioned as candidates for National Guard activation pushed back on the notion.Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, who served in the U.S. Army, said in a statement that the president’s decision to call in the National Guard to the District of Columbia “lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous.”Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the president could not send in the National Guard to Chicago.“Let’s not lie to the public, you and I both know you have no authority to take over Chicago,” he said.The conflict between Trump and the Democrats comes at the same time Newsom has threatened to launch a redistricting of California’s congressional districts in order to nullify Texas’ attempt to redraw maps to add more Republican seats to the U.S. House.And Pritzker is hosting in Illinois the Texas Democrats who left the state to prevent the state legislature from having a quorum after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session for redistricting.Military forcesSince taking office for his second term, the president has signed five executive orders that lay out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extend other executive powers to speed up Trump’s immigration crackdown.More funding also soon will be at hand for Trump’s mass deportations. The massive tax and spending cut bill enacted in July has as its centerpiece $170 billion for the administration's immigration crackdown. It bolsters border security, increases immigration detention capacity and adds fees to legal pathways for immigration, among other things. Thousands more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are slated to be hired.Some Republican governors have agreed to deploy their own National Guard members to aid the Trump administration in immigration enforcement, such as in Iowa and Tennessee. The secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sent National Guard to the southern border in Texas when she was governor of South Dakota.Nunn said that while it’s not typically normal for states to use National Guard members for local policing there is some precedent, such as when New York had members stationed in the New York City subway.“What is unprecedented is the federal government using military personnel for sort of crime prevention, for regular policing,” Nunn said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-08-12 17:57:29.799477

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A Republican state House member has filed a campaign finance complaint against a colleague, alleging thousands of dollars in illegal transactions using campaign funds.
Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, filed the complaint against Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, with the secretary of state’s office on Friday.
In the complaint, Bradley wrote that a social media account “made (her) aware of the gross negligence and the vast violations. An account on X with the handle @govtgrifters, which regularly posts about Colorado lawmakers’ spending, posted screenshots of expenditures included in Bradley’s complaint on July 1.

The complaint details expenditures as reported by Weinberg in required regular disclosures to the secretary of state’s office, including over $1,000 for various trips to a Loveland barbershop, about $2,500 to the University Club near the Colorado Capitol for meeting expenses, about $400 to a New Jersey cigar shop categorized as gifts and donations, about $675 at the Brown Palace hotel in Denver on the last day of this year’s legislative session, and about $2,000 as a donation to the Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel-Aviv Football Club.
Bradley also listed donations to the Salvation Army, Sertoma Club of Loveland and Loveland Rotary Club.
Weinberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Colorado campaign finance law dictates that campaign funds should only be used for expenditures “reasonably related” to the election of the candidate in question or related to their official duties once elected. Unexpended contributions can be sent to a political party, donated to a charity, returned to the donor, used for political issue education or used for a campaign for a different office. Many of the expenditures in question are listed as meeting expenses or donations.
Bradley alleged that the donation to the Israeli soccer team violated both state and federal law. The club has a foundational arm, however, that runs programs for at-risk and special needs children, and Weinberg’s expenditure lists the address that the foundation recommends donors send checks to.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders and U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon toured two Arkansas schools Tuesday as part of McMahon’s “Returning Education to the States” tour.
They were joined by Arkansas junior U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton and state Education Secretary Jacob Oliva on tours of Little Rock’s Don R. Roberts Elementary School and Saline County Career and Technical Campus in Benton.
“I wanted to be in places where I could actually see some of the things that I talked about at work,” McMahon said in Saline County. “Not necessarily everybody has to go to a four-year school. There are places like this that would be sponsored from the tech field, where students can earn dual credits, go right into community college, go right to work in the field. … This is the secret sauce.”
McMahon and Cotton both alluded to the need to rid schools of red tape and bureaucracy. President Donald Trump has said he plans on shuttering the U.S. Department of Education to give states more power over education and wants McMahon to put herself out of her own job — a plan McMahon has supported.
Sanders also touted the expansion of the state’s Educational Freedom Account program to around 50,000 students in Arkansas this year. The program, which is open to all Arkansas students for the first time this fall, provides state funding for allowable education expenses, such as private school tuition.
While Sanders and McMahon focused on the positive during their two stops, a handful of protestors outside Roberts Elementary held signs criticizing the state’s LEARNS Act and McMahon. The wide-ranging 2023 law made several changes to the state’s K-12 education system, including creating the school voucher program and raising the state’s minimum teacher salary to $50,000

“The parents of [Roberts Elementary] were incredibly upset when the letter was sent home yesterday … that she would be here,” said Courtney Jackson, a mother of two. She said she didn’t want her children to find out she just stood by while public education was under attack.
“The parents of this school do not want her here,” Jackson said.
Alison Metzler, another protesting parent, said she kept her kids home from school Tuesday because she didn’t want them to be used as “political pawns” by Sanders and McMahon.
“Sarah Huckabee and McMahon are actively trying to dismantle public education, and they do not care about public education. This is all for show, and it’s, it’s just disgusting,” Metzler said. “If Sarah Huckabee really stood with public education, her kids would go to public schools. Instead, they go to the private school a mile down the road, and she’s defunding these exact schools.”
Metzler also criticized Sanders and McMahon for visiting the “whitest affluent school in the Little Rock School District, a top school in the state.” She said she loved the school as a parent with a child who attended, but that if Sanders was really committed to public education, she would be visiting struggling schools in other parts of Little Rock.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing, and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware, and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

A federal judge has denied a request by a Florida man convicted in the EB-5 scandal that played out in northern Vermont to shorten his time on court-ordered supervised release.
Judge Geoffrey Crawford issued a one-paragraph order Monday rejecting the request filed in June in U.S. District Court in Burlington by an attorney for William Kelly to end his three-year term of supervised release a year early.
Crawford wrote in the order that Kelly’s supervised release had been transferred in March 2024 to Florida, where Kelly, 76, resides. As a result, the judge added, Kelly could make a request to a federal court in Florida to change his period of supervised release. 
Robert Goldstein, an attorney for Kelly, declined comment Tuesday.
Kelly, who prosecutors termed the “consummate fixer” who tried to “outwit” regulators when they were investigating the scandal, was eventually indicted on criminal charges in 2019 along with two of his business partners. 
Those two men were Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak ski resort, and Bill Stenger, Jay Peak’s former president and CEO. 
All three were indicted on federal criminal charges and later reached plea deals in connection with their roles in a proposed $110 million biomedical research facility slated for Newport in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom. The project never got off the ground and was later termed “nearly a complete fraud” by regulators. 
The case left many foreign investors out of their investment and no way to meet the job-creating requirements to secure U.S. residency, or green cards, they were seeking through the EB-5 visa program.
All three men were later sentenced to prison, with Kelly receiving an 18-month term, which he has since served. He was also ordered to serve three years on supervised release, which requires regular check-in with authorities and certain travel restrictions.
Kelly was also required to make monthly payments on the $8.3 million in restitution included in his sentencing. 
The motion seeking an early end from supervised release stated Kelly “worked diligently to rebuild and contribute positively” to the community.  
“His family, church, and community have all been vital in his transformation, and he takes pride in trying to give back to his community in meaningful ways,” the filing stated.

(Photo via Google Earth)A veterinary technician who allegedly stole drugs from the clinic where she worked and a rural veterinarian accused of unlawfully distributing controlled substances have been sanctioned by the state.
According to the Iowa Board of Veterinary Medicine, veterinary technician Katherine Schwartz repeatedly stole prescription drugs from the clinic where she worked. The drugs, which Schwartz allegedly took for her personal use, included codeine, Zorbium and hydrocodone.
The board alleges that several signs of possible substance abuse by Schwartz were discovered during its investigation of the matter, and it alleged she had deleted security-camera footage from the clinic and stolen a key to a drug safe at the clinic.
According to the board, Schwartz has admitted the theft.
The board has not disclosed where or when the alleged thefts took place, or where Schwartz lives, although police records indicate she lives in Solon and the thefts occurred at the Animal Kingdom Veterinary Clinic, 620 Liberty Way, North Liberty.
According to the board, Schwartz was charged with unlawful possession of a prescription drug, a serious misdemeanor, and at some point pleaded guilty to the charge.
There are no public court records related to the criminal case, most likely because of the deferred judgment that the board says she was granted at sentencing. A deferred judgment typically results in a conviction being wiped from public court records after the successful completion of probation.
Citing the alleged conviction, the board charged Schwartz with knowingly making misleading or untrue representations in the practice of the profession; committing an act contrary to honesty, justice or good morals, and an inability to practice veterinary medicine with reasonable skill and safety.
In order to resolve the case, the board agreed to a settlement that placed Schwartz’s veterinary technician certification on probation for the duration of her criminal case probation, which appears to have already been terminated. During her probation, Schwartz was required to submit to monthly testing for substance abuse.
Although the board entered into the agreement with Schwartz in April, the charges against her and the settlement were made public only this week in response to a formal request for access to the records.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to locate Schwartz for comment.
Brooklyn vet sanctioned by board
Another veterinary board case from April that was first made public this week involves Eric Smith, a veterinarian from the Farm & Family Veterinary Clinic in Brooklyn, Iowa.
In April, the board charged Smith with violating a law related to the practice of veterinary medicine, willful or repeated failure to conform to acceptable standards of practice, and willful or repeated violations of the law or state regulations.
The charges stem from actions taken last year by the Iowa Board of Pharmacy, which issued an emergency order suspending Smith’s pharmacy license, stating he posed “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.” The board also charged Smith with four counts of alleged violations of Iowa laws governing the practice of pharmacy and the distribution of drugs.
In the pharmacy board case, Smith eventually agreed to have his pharmacy license placed on probation for two years and pay a $1,000 civil penalty.
The veterinary board reported that in March 2024, it fielded a complaint that alleged Smith was providing controlled substances to a dog breeding operation, rather than to the individual canine patients, without proper documentation or detailed records documenting the distribution of the drugs.
As with the pharmacy board case, the veterinary board’s case against Smith was resolved with a settlement agreement that imposes a two-year period of probation on his license and a $1,000 civil penalty.
Smith did not immediately return a call to his clinic on Tuesday.

Flood barriers have been installed since last year's flooding, but city officials are still asking for voluntary evacuations of the area. (Photo courtesy of City and Borough of Juneau)Officials in Alaska’s capital city are asking residents to voluntarily evacuate from parts of the Mendenhall Valley ahead of an expected glacial flood this week.
Last year’s flood damaged more than 290 homes in the valley, a largely suburban district of Juneau that is located near the Mendenhall Glacier, and while city officials have constructed temporary barriers to deter future flooding, those barriers haven’t yet been tested in an actual emergency.
“We are issuing those evacuation advisories, because although we are extremely confident in the HESCO barriers’ capability to protect neighborhoods, we’re not willing to bet on that with anybody’s life — or safety,” said Ryan O’Shaughnessy, director of emergency programs for the City and Borough of Juneau.
The Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area, Alaska’s most-visited tourist destination, is preparing to shut down as well. The Nugget Falls Trail, the most-used pathway in the area, was closed to the public on Monday.
Officials from the U.S. Forest Service, which operates the glacier tourist site, did not participate in a media briefing Monday. Agencies at that briefing said the Mendenhall Glacier is short-staffed. The recreation site experienced widespread layoffs as part of a broader federal reduction in force earlier this year.
Late Sunday night, cellphones across Juneau rang with warning tones as city officials sent out an alert: Water has begun to overtop an ice dam that allows the creation of a glacial lake each summer.
Officials expect that within a week, the water will gush from the dam and into Mendenhall Lake, which lays at the glacier’s foot. From there, water will surge into the Mendenhall River and toward homes.
The first glacial outburst flood at Mendenhall Glacier happened in 2011, but the flooding was initially minor. Because the glacier is shrinking due to climate change, the floods have grown worse over time, culminating in last year’s disaster.
Aaron Jacobs, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Juneau, said this year’s ice dam is lower by 13 feet than it was last year, but the glacial lake — located in a place called Suicide Basin — contains about as much water as it did last year because melting ice elsewhere has increased the capacity of the basin.
“We’re expecting very similar volume estimates from last year,” he said.
That volume, about 16 billion gallons, weighs almost 67 million tons, the equivalent weight of 335 fully loaded container ships rushing through a normally placid river.
Eight inches of rain fell on and near the basin in recent days, Jacobs said, and hydrographs show that the level of Mendenhall Lake and River have risen.
That’s a little misleading: The lake and river will fall over the next few days as the rain diminishes, then will surge once the ice dam fails to contain the basin.
It isn’t clear how bad the resulting flood will be. That depends on things as varied as the tide, rainfall and the success or failure of the flood barriers.
O’Shaughnessy said officials will send out another emergency text alert to Juneau cellphones before the peak flood.
An emergency evacuation shelter has been set up at nearby Floyd Dryden school, and both state and local officials have issued preemptive disaster declarations as a precaution.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/12/ct-baby-bonds-trump-accounts/,"For proponents of baby bonds in Connecticut, the 'Trump accounts' are an ineffective way to address wealth disparities.","As the White House celebrated the July 4 passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, President Donald J. Trump paused to commemorate one specific aspect of measure: the creation of new savings accounts that will give each newborn baby with a Social Security number, born between 2025 and 2028, $1000 that will grow in an account established by the government. 
Days later, Connecticut State Treasurer Erick Russell stood before an audience of his own to praise a different program aimed at investing in the state’s youth. Since 2023, Connecticut has run a “baby bonds” program, giving $3,200 to babies born to families eligible for the state’s Medicaid program HUSKY. 
Children can draw on the accounts once they turn 18, and can use the saved up money to pay for college, start a business, or make a down payment on a home. So far, more than 33,000 babies in the state are eligible for the program, the first state-level baby bonds program in the nation. 
Viewed from a distance, Trump accounts and Connecticut’s baby bonds could be viewed similarly. But as he spoke last month, Russell sought to make clear that the programs couldn’t be more different. 
“Baby bonds were created to narrow Connecticut’s generational wealth gap by investing directly in children from low-income families, whereas Trump Accounts advantage families who already have the ability to save, while leaving behind those who don’t,” Russell said. 
It’s a distinction the treasurer says is deeply important. As so-called “Trump Accounts”  have drawn considerable attention in recent months, supporters have argued that the accounts will help build the financial futures of America’s children, a goal shared by supporters of baby bonds initiatives.
But critics of the federal program say it falls short, arguing the savings program may not be as effective as more traditional accounts like 529 savings or a Roth IRA. And baby bonds proponents in places like Connecticut say Trump accounts won’t address economic disparities.
“It’s important to note that baby bonds are really about addressing wealth inequality,” Russell said in a recent interview. “And that is not what the Trump accounts are designed to do.”
A new federal savings account 
Trump accounts, also known as “MAGA accounts,” first drew attention this spring as discussions of the president’s budget reconciliation bill ramped up. 
The idea on its face seemed simple: Babies born between 2025 and 2028 would be given $1,000 by the federal government, which they wouldn’t be able to touch until they turn 18. Parents, employers, charities and other organizations can add extra money — up to $5,000 a year — on top of the federal government’s one-time contribution. 
The idea has had strong support among some prominent Republicans in Congress, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, who is credited with bringing the idea to the president after hearing about it at a poker game.
If used to their full potential, proponents argue, the money could provide a significant launchpad for America’s youth. 
“Decades of research has shown that giving children a financial head start profoundly impacts their long-term success. With these accounts, children will be much more likely to graduate from college, to start a business, to buy a home, and achieve lifelong financial stability,” Dell CEO Michael Dell said in a statement earlier this year.  
The idea behind Trump Accounts isn’t new. For years, politicians in Congress, most notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley have promoted a bill called the American Opportunity Accounts Act, which sought to give each child in the country $1,000, with additional contributions each year working on a progressive scale. The bill is seen as a more traditional form of the wealth building proposal known as “baby bonds.”
Baby bonds have been proposed at various points in the past few years, with economists arguing they can help address wealth disparities in ways that more traditional financial advice cannot. 
“We know that income, hard work, and savings behavior are not enough to achieve true financial independence for those who start with fewer resources,” said David Radcliffe, state and local policy director for the Institute on Race Power and Political Economy at the New School. “The power of baby bonds is the focus on the endowment itself, substantial seed capital for wealth building activities that will drive economic security.”
Traditionally, baby bonds programs focus on making larger investments for those at lower income levels, using government investment to help close the nation’s yawning racial wealth gap.
That federal money would be used is a given, says Radcliffe, who previously worked as a policy director for former Connecticut state treasurer Shawn Wooden. “One could argue, it’s through government design of policy over generations that has in many ways created the situation that we’re now in where certain groups, particularly people of color — black and Hispanic, indigenous folks — have been excluded from policies that have otherwise, you know, generated the wealth to create a middle class,” he said.
Trump accounts however, do something different. Rather than focus on wealth disparities, the accounts provide an equal investment for each child. The ability to save in the accounts then depends on how much money each child’s family can contribute: Wealthier families may have the resources to contribute more, while poorer families contribute less.
Federal policy experts focused on the wealth gap and youth saving say that this difference could create issues down the line. 
“The reality for American families is that a third of them don’t have $2,000 in an emergency savings account,” said Madeline Brown, a senior policy associate at the Urban Institute. “So the idea that every family is going to be able to contribute to this type of program is just not borne out by the reality of the financial situation of many American families.”
In Connecticut, baby bonds focus on vulnerable
When Connecticut passed its first-in-the-nation baby bonds program in 2023, the focus was on investing in the state’s poorest families. That focus, Russell explained in a July interview with the Connecticut Mirror, is deeply intentional.
“If you look at most of the work that we’re doing in Connecticut, it’s about thinking about this more holistically, and thinking about it longer term,” he said. “And I think we’ve seen that in the need, frankly, to continue to invest in communities.”
As a result, the Connecticut program makes an investment that proponents argue is more progressive, giving money to low-income children that can be used once they turn 18 to pay for education, a down payment, or starting a business. The $3,200 investment could grow to anywhere between $10,000 to $24,000 according to the treasurer’s office. 
Trump accounts meanwhile, could grow to just over $3,000 for families unable to add money, to more than $100,000 for families who can afford to max out the annual contribution each year. 
Russell explains that with wealth disparities continuing to widen in the state, “it is really critical that we’re looking at real ways to address wealth inequality and truly lift people up.”
Connecticut’s baby bonds experiment is underway. 
The state will continue to fund the program for the next decade. The treasurer’s office is currently working on an ambassador program that will provide additional resources to baby bonds-eligible communities, and also provide feedback to the state about what additional needs are. 
And the idea is continuing to gain traction: Baby bonds proposals are currently being considered in more than a dozen other states. 
Russell says that financial investment, whether through baby bonds, Trump Accounts, or another program, is just one aspect of addressing the needs of vulnerable communities. 
“The economy is going to be stronger if we are investing in people who can participate, who can contribute,” he said. “This is about investing in the future workforce, about these resources going back into our communities.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024_0626_THM_ITRErickRussell-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 17:57:29.799477

(Berman for Congress photo)Mitchell Berman, a Racine County nurse, announced Tuesday he will seek the Democratic nod to run for Congress in Wisconsin’s 1st District against fourth-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Janesville).
Berman is the second candidate to enter the Democratic primary race for the seat. Randy Bryce, who lost to Steil in 2018 in one of the nation’s most closely watched congressional contests, announced May 20 that he would try again.
Berman introduced his candidacy Tuesday with a video shot on a mobile phone that stresses his working class background and rural Wisconsin upbringing.

“I’m running for Congress because Bryan Steil isn’t looking out for families like mine,” Berman says in the video. “We deserve a government that works for us, not the elite.”
Berman worked as a nurse at the Milwaukee VA hospital for 10 years and in the video highlights his service to military veterans.
He told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday that he left the job when he decided to run for Congress because the federal Hatch Act bars federal employees from running for partisan  office.
The father of two and a 15-year resident of the 1st Congressional District, Berman said concern for his daughters “about whether or not they have the ability to make their own health care decisions” motivated his run for the seat.
“Seeing the cuts to the VA and just the overall gutting of Medicaid in general has also prompted me to get into this race,” he said. Cuts to Medicaid and the SNAP federal nutrition aid program were part of the Republican budget reconciliation bill that Steil voted for and President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
“These things were made for tax cuts for billionaires,” Berman said, adding that in the process, Congress added $3.5 trillion to the federal budget deficit instead of  reducing it.
“I think the No. 1  issue that we need to focus on is affordability,” Berman said. “And I think that umbrella covers many different issues … decreasing the cost of child care, decreasing the cost of health care, decreasing the cost at the grocery store.”
As of July 30, the Cook Political Report rated the 1st District a likely Republican win in 2026 with a 2-point edge for the incumbent, Steil. Cook defines seats rated “likely” for one or the other party as “not considered competitive at this point” but adds that they “have the potential to become engaged.”
Berman said he believes his life experiences will attract voters.
“I’ve lived paycheck to paycheck. I had to work three jobs in college,” Berman said. “I was a first-generation college student. I graduated with student loan debt. My wife and I, we struggled with fertility issues and our children are a blessing of IVF [in vitro fertilization]. So a lot of these kitchen table concerns for people, a lot of these things that people care about close to home, are things that I’ve experienced.”
Berman said he followed news accounts of Steil’s July 31 public event in Elkhorn, where the congressman was met with an angry, noisy crowd and questioners who loudly pushed back on many of his comments.
“I think that’s a good representation of people’s dismay and how upset they are in how Bryan Steil … his lack of representation for the district.”
A first-time political candidate, Berman said he’s been active in local politics as a volunteer, including filing a successful lawsuit that charged the Town of Raymond School District violated the state open meetings law in holding a school board retreat in 2022. The suit was settled in December 2024.
The school district was also embroiled in a dispute among parents over its  social-emotional learning curriculum and the firing of a popular principal. Berman was a leader in a campaign to recall two board members who opposed the curriculum. One of the board members resigned before the recall vote was held, while the other survived the recall election.
“Everyone in my community, everyone I’ve talked to about this opportunity, has been very encouraging,” Berman said.
A reliably Democratic seat in the 1970s and ‘80s, the 1st District has remained in GOP hands since 1994, despite recurring attempts by Democrats to unseat Republican incumbents. The seat was held for two decades by former Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville), who rose to become U.S. House speaker before leaving office at the end of 2018.
Steil, a corporate lawyer who previously worked as Ryan’s aide, won his first term against Bryce with more than 54% of the vote to Bryce’s 42%. He won his two most recent races by similar margins. He beat former state Department of Revenue Secretary Peter Barca 54-44 in 2024 and Ann Roe, now a Wisconsin state representative from Janesville, 54-45 in 2022.

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.




This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida



Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Self-driving cars aren’t here yet, but states are getting the rules ready

Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

Zeldin made the announcement at the Iowa State Fair and said the current DEF regulations were “unacceptable.” 
“It is unacceptable that farmers, truckers, construction workers, and many other small businesses continually experience failures of diesel-powered equipment when they need it most — costing millions of dollars in lost productivity,” Zeldin said in a statement.

DEF is added to exhaust streams to help reduce the nitrous oxide emissions of burning diesel fuel. EPA rolled out requirements for DEF in the mid 2000s and early 2010s, ensuring that on-road diesel trucks and off-road equipment, like tractors or bulldozers, were equipped with systems that would reduce speed or power of the machinery in the event the machine ran out of DEF. 
According to a press release from EPA these regulations brought the machinery in line with the agency’s emission standards, but caused “significant disruptions in logistics, agriculture, and construction.” In many cases a DEF sensor failure would cause a vehicle to derate to as slow as 5 miles per hour or become inoperable. 
Zeldin’s announcement tasks new diesel on-road trucks, beginning with model year 2027, to be engineered such that running out of DEF will not cause “sudden and severe” power losses. 
EPA has also created guidance to help manufacturers make software changes that will similarly prevent DEF derating on vehicles that are already in use. 
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, called the previous DEF regulations a “Green New Deal” type of regulation that brought tractors to a halt. 
“The previous arbitrary diesel exhaust fluid system guidelines severely hurt farmers, truckers, and small businesses that rely on diesel powered trucks,” Ernst said in a statement. “Not only will the new guidelines save family-run farms hundreds of millions every year, but it is also simply common sense.”
Nitrous oxide, which DEF helps to reduce from diesel exhaust, is categorized by the EPA as having atmospheric warming qualities 265 times greater than carbon dioxide. It also says that 40% of global nitrous oxide emissions come from human activities. 
Zeldin’s plan would not completely eliminate DEF systems, but would significantly extend the amount of time between when the system fails and when machinery capacity is reduced. 
U.S. Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler was also at the Iowa State Fair with Zeldin for the announcement and said family farms will save an estimated $727 million annually as a result of the change.
““The Trump Administration is fighting for farmers and truckers, as evidenced by the EPA’s new DEF guidance which is a big win for the millions of small businesses who rely on diesel engines – and who have been crushed by years of costly Green New Scam regulations,” Loeffler said in a statement.
This action comes weeks after EPA officials submitted a proposal to ditch a long-held standing that greenhouse gas emissions threaten the environment and public health.

Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday that he filled a vacant judgeship — a vacancy that spurred a now-dropped lawsuit in the Florida Supreme Court.
A day after the American Civil Liberties Union dropped its lawsuit claiming DeSantis violated the Florida Constitution by not filling a vacant judgeship, the governor sent out a news release announcing he has appointed Kristine Van Vorst as judge for the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court.
DeSantis did fill vacant judgeship before deadline, despite ACLU lawsuit

The administration had already disclosed the Aug. 1 appointment in legal papers filed with the court but the news release lets the public in on the news.
The ACLU, in the Supreme Court on Aug. 8, argued that DeSantis did not respond to “repeated” inquiries on the status of the judgeship before it filed the lawsuit, nor did his office issue a press release at that time about the appointment.
The governor’s news release does not state the date of the appointment. “Today, Governor Ron DeSantis announces one judicial appointment,” it says.
The Aug. 1 appointment came, two days before the constitutionally required deadline. Governors are obligated to appoint a judge within 60 days of receiving a list of nominees.
The circuit includes Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Gilchrist, Levy, and Union counties.
The difference between an appointment before or after Aug. 18 would’ve been the difference between the new judge’s first election happening in 2026 or 2028, the ACLU contended, potentially giving the appointee an “extra two unlawful years” to serve before an election.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Highway Patrol)Traffic and injury accidents were up while deaths and arrests were down during the recently concluded Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.
The 85th annual event began Aug. 1 and continued through Sunday. The increased traffic followed a trend of higher attendance in round-numbered anniversary years.
The South Dakota Department of Transportation’s automated traffic counters at nine locations in Sturgis logged 537,459 vehicles entering the city during the rally, which was up 11% compared with last year, according to final numbers published Tuesday. It was also an 11% increase over the previous five-year average.
With the increased traffic came a shift toward greater accident severity. The overall number of traffic accidents reported by the Highway Patrol in the Sturgis and Rapid City areas during the rally was 93, only four more than last year, but the number of injury accidents increased from 35 to 66, while the number of non-injury accidents fell from 54 to 27.

The increased traffic was also accompanied by more tickets and warnings. There were 1,524 citations issued by the Highway Patrol this year, up from 1,455 last year, and 4,959 warnings, up from 4,445.
Meanwhile, drunken driving arrests by troopers fell from 155 to 119, misdemeanor drug arrests dropped from 281 to 266, and felony drug arrests declined from 163 to 104.
The number of traffic deaths in the state potentially attributable to this year’s rally is at least six, according to a South Dakota Searchlight analysis, down from 12 last year. Searchlight counts any motorcycle-involved traffic death anywhere in the state, not only during the official dates but also during the days just before and after the rally.
That’s different from the Highway Patrol, which only counts crashes on official rally dates and only in western South Dakota, and therefore typically undercounts rally-related deaths. Using those parameters, the Highway Patrol counted four deaths this year and three last year.
Neither method includes deaths that occur in other states while bikers are traveling to or from the rally, or deaths in nearby states such as Wyoming, where there are rally-themed events that attract bikers to ride back and forth across the state line. This year, the Wyoming Highway Patrol reported three motorcycle-involved crash deaths from the day before the rally’s official start through the rally’s end. 
 



 Recent motorcycle crash deaths in SD

The following six motorcycle-involved traffic deaths occurred in South Dakota during the days leading up to and including the 2025 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. All information is from the state Department of Public Safety, which includes the Highway Patrol.

Thursday, July 31: Anthony Michalicki, 70, of Pompano Beach, Florida, died from injuries suffered when the Harley Davidson he was driving just east of Deadwood on U.S. Highway 14A left the road and entered the ditch, separating him from the bike. 
Friday, Aug. 1: Manuel O. Acosta, 71, of Chicago, died from injuries he suffered when his westbound Harley Davidson began wobbling and fell down on Interstate 90 three miles east of Chamberlain, sending it into the ditch and separating him from the bike.
Saturday, Aug. 2: The 58-year-old male driver of a Harley Davidson (whose name has not yet been released) was traveling in the passing lane of U.S. Highway 16A in the Mount Rushmore area when he was unable to negotiate a curve and the bike tipped onto its side, slid and collided with three other motorcycles, killing the 58-year-old man and injuring the others.
Sunday, Aug. 3: Sturgis Police attempted to stop a 28-year-old man (whose name has not yet been released) on a Harley Davidson for exhibition driving near the Iron Horse Saloon, but the driver fled, resulting in a pursuit that ended when the motorcycle left the road and entered the ditch at mile marker 52 on U.S. Highway 14A, causing the man’s death the next day from injuries suffered in the crash. 
Monday, Aug. 4: A 60-year-old male driver (whose name has not yet been released) of a Harley Davidson on U.S. Highway 16A near mile marker 43 in the Black Hills slid into two other motorcycles while attempting to navigate a sharp corner, killing the 60-year-old and injuring his female passenger and the two other drivers.
Thursday, Aug. 7: The driver of a Toyota Tacoma pickup on state Highway 44 east of Rapid City made a left turn without seeing an approaching Honda CBR motorcycle, causing a crash that killed the motorcycle’s 23-year-old male driver (whose name has not yet been released) but did not injure the driver of the pickup.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GxtGz7QWIAAn1eH-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-12 16:57:13.167358

Overjoyed newsroom staff in communities across Wyoming are back on the job with pay after corporate closure laid off 30 employees.

Wyoming newspaper executives Robb and Jen Hicks and Rob Mortimore announced Tuesday they’ve reached an agreement to purchase eight local newspapers to keep them running after a corporate owner shuttered them without warning last week.
“What better news could you get,” said Marie Hamilton, reporter and managing editor for two of the papers: the Platte County Record-Times and Guernsey Gazette. “There was a lot of tears, but good tears,” she said of the staff reaction to the announcement. 
The announcement comes six days after the Illinois-based News Media Corporation suddenly closed its publications in Niobrara, Goshen, Platte, Sublette and Uinta counties. The sale agreement calls for rehiring all newspaper staff and immediately resuming publication of all titles, according to Robb Hicks. 
“We are honored to assume stewardship of these legacy community newspapers,” he said in an announcement posted to the newspapers Facebook pages. “Our foremost priority has been to ensure that these counties are not left without a credible, enduring source of local journalism.”
Mortimore expressed “an immense debt of gratitude to JJ Tompkins,” the former owner, in the announcement. 
“Our foremost priority has been to ensure that these counties are not left without a credible, enduring source of local journalism.” Robb Hicks, Wyoming publisher
“It would have been far simpler for him to yield to the demands of creditors,” Mortimore said. “Instead, he chose to work with us to safeguard the future of these Wyoming communities, to preserve their newspapers, and to ensure that every employee was paid and retained.”   
An overwhelmed and overjoyed Hamilton described Mortimore as pulling a rabbit out of a hat and emphasized the value of the new in-state ownership. 
“He’s a Goshen boy,” she said, of Mortimore, who grew up in Torrington and has long worked at and run newspapers in the state. “Wyoming problems need Wyoming solutions from Wyoming people.” 
Mortimore will continue to serve as group publisher. The Hicks have owned and operated Buffalo Bulletin, where Robb is publisher and Jen Sieve-Hicks serves as executive editor, since 1996. The Hicks family has multigenerational ties to Wyoming newspapers, dating back seven decades, the announcement said.
The agreement follows News Media Corporation’s announcement  Wednesday that it was closing its doors immediately and “permanently” — abruptly shuttering newspapers in Wheatland, Torrington, Evanston, Pinedale, Kemmerer, Lusk, Lyman and Guernsey. The eight Wyoming newspapers, with 30 employees, were among about two dozen newspapers across five states that suddenly went dark. 
Mortimore was the publisher of Wyoming Newspapers Inc., a subsidiary of News Media Corporation. Although he oversaw News Media Corporation’s publications in Wyoming and Nebraska, he said last Wednesday’s shutdown came as a “shock” to him, alongside the employees he managed.
“This closure had nothing to do with the Wyoming newspapers,” Hamilton said. “All of our papers were profitable.”
Not willing to watch their communities become news deserts overnight, Mortimore and many laid-off employees started looking for ways to keep the newspapers going. Hamilton and other staff kept working, without pay, to keep the papers going. Under the purchase agreement, Hamilton expects to receive a paycheck by the end of this week. 
Marie Hamilton was the managing editor and primary reporter for The Platte County Record-Times until she and 29 other employees lost their jobs with the closure of eight Wyoming newspapers. “We’re not done — not by a long shot,” she posted on social media of efforts to rescue local news in eastern Wyoming. (Lisa Phelps)
“We will get a paycheck on Friday, which I said, ‘I don’t care. You just told me my newspaper’s back,'” Hamilton told WyoFile.
Mortimore and the Hicks were not alone in their quest to get the papers back up and running. 
Darcie Hoffland, executive director of the state’s newspaper trade group, the Wyoming Press Association, told WyoFile late last week that the association had been scrambling to help find a solution.
“There’s a lot of people who care about these communities [and] are working really, really hard to get the job, to get these papers open as quickly as possible,” she said.
State law says newspapers must publish an edition at least once a week to be deemed an “official” newspaper and eligible to print legal notices — a coveted source of revenue that’s helped sustain Wyoming newspapers. News Media Corporation owned a significant chunk of Wyoming’s legal newspapers — eight of 39.
The newspaper closures had towns and counties across the state looking at ways to post and publish legal notices, from posting them in their clerk’s offices to moving publication to other newspapers. 
The Pinedale Roundup broke its publishing streak last week after its Illinois-based parent company instructed staff to cancel the Roundup’s Aug. 7 print edition, which had already been reported, edited and designed. Roundup Managing Editor Cali O’Hare then broke the news of the closures on the paper’s Facebook page and website. Today, the eight newspapers had more news to break online, posting to their Facebook pages the newly inked new purchase agreement.
In last Wednesday’s memo to employees, News Media Corporation CEO J.J. Tompkins said the company would “make all reasonable efforts” to issue final paychecks, while health insurance coverage was terminated immediately. 
In the memo to employees, Tompkins cited “financial challenges, a significant economic downturn impacting our industry, revenue losses and increasing expenses, and the recent failure of an attempt to sell the company…” 
Mortimore had informed staff in late July that a potential plan to sell the company to the Alabama-based Carpenter Media Group was no longer in play.
Tompkins said the company had explored “every possible avenue” to continue operating, but “reached a point where continuing business is no longer feasible.”

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.
“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Butler Hospital’s unionized workforce declared Tuesday that they made “movement” on wages and health plan costs to hospital owner Care New England during hours of negotiations last week.
Care New England CEO Michael Wagner chose a different noun for the union’s counterproposal in an email he wrote last week: “Ultimatum.”
The breakdown of harmony between management and the Providence psychiatric hospital’s roughly 700 members of SEIU 1199NE was apparent as members of the union’s bargaining committee held a Tuesday morning press conference outside the facility’s Blackstone Boulevard entrance.     
Asked by reporters if any bargaining talks were planned in the next week, registered nurse and bargaining committee member Dawn Williams said, “Right now, we do not have anything scheduled.”
Members of the union bargaining committee said they met for 18 hours on Aug. 6 with a federal mediator and Butler’s negotiating team. As day wound into night, union members said they offered two counterproposals in the spirit of settling the dispute. But at 3 a.m., union members said that the hospital team walked away from the bargaining table.  
“The process of coming up with the last two proposals that we did on Wednesday was…very painful,” Williams said. “It was very difficult because these aren’t numbers on a page. They represent a real impact on our people, our members, their lives, and their families.”
The strike will reach the 90-day mark this Friday, and is purported to be the longest hospital labor strike in state history. The hospital and union’s relationship soured after the March 31 expiration of the four contracts which covered Butler’s SEIU 1199NE members. Despite months of sporadic negotiations, plus the involvement of federal labor meditators, including in the most recent session, the two sides have not yet found a common ground to stand on. 
Tuesday’s press conference marked the first public, collective statement from the union since Butler announced Friday it would soon close an additional 29 beds in its addiction and detox unit.
Williams and other members of the Butler workforce’s bargaining committee emphasized they want to return to work but vowed the strike will continue as long as the hospital continues to propose what the union sees as inadequate compensation for the lowest-paid workers, such as clerical, dietary and sanitation staff. The starting pay would be $18.03 for these workers in the most recent hospital proposal from July 11. Union members voted to reject that proposal on July 29.   
“Our last two counterproposals brought us within $1.2 million, over four years, between our wage proposal and the employer’s proposal,” said Courtney Threats, a social worker and bargaining team member. “That’s $300,000 a year.”
Brooke Huminski, a social worker in the inpatient assessment center, told reporters that, in their latest counterproposal, the union was willing to accept a monthly premium of $110 monthly for workers with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).
“That is considerable movement on a plan that I deeply value,” Huminski said, citing her own experience with a chronic illness that she was able to get adequate care for — without excessive medical debt — thanks to her employee health insurance. 
“We understand the cost of health care is rising all around us, so we’re willing to pay a little bit more to have a really good health insurance plan as well as to get this done,” Huminski said. “It’s been 90 days. Why are we still out here? We are ready to go back to work.”
“We’re ready to get back to work,” Williams echoed. “We’re ready to do the work that needs to be done to get a proposal. We are ready, but where are they? Why did they walk away? Why aren’t they ready? Why aren’t Butler Hospital and Care New England ready?”
Williams continued: “The answer is because it’s never been about money for them. It’s about power and greed. They want it all.”

Care New England says union walked back progress 
Hillary Lima, a spokesperson for Butler, said Tuesday afternoon that the hospital did not have any comment on the union’s morning press event, nor did she confirm whether the beds in Butler’s addiction unit are officially shuttered.
But Care New England CEO Michael Wagner certainly had a take on the Aug. 6 bargaining talks, per an email he sent to colleagues inside and outside his hospital system. 
Wagner’s Aug. 7 email, obtained by Rhode Island Current last week, tells a different side to the story. Wagner wrote that by 3 a.m., the union had reversed any progress made earlier in the day by giving “an ultimatum to accept a narrow and costly set of wage increases.”
“Critically, we were not given the opportunity to negotiate on other elements of the contract that might have allowed us to maintain a financially sustainable agreement,” Wagner wrote. “At that point, it became clear that SEIU was no longer negotiating in good faith and had abandoned any meaningful effort to reach an agreement.”
The union, Wagner argued, “was intent on shifting the goal posts” in the most recent bargaining session. 
A Butler website also noted in an Aug. 7 post that the bargaining talks lasted 15 hours, not 18.
Mike Raia, also a spokesperson for Butler, has previously denied the claim of absent leadership, and said in an Aug. 5 email that Wagner and Butler President and Chief Operating Officer Mary Marran attended multiple bargaining sessions with union leaders. 
Typically, Raia added, the hospital’s bargaining team has full authority to reach an agreement, and it’s normal for these teams to represent employers in collective bargaining talks. 
“The content of those [July] meetings were off-the-record but it is not at all accurate for SEIU to claim Butler has refused to meet,” Raia also said in a July 30 email.
Outside the hospital, Williams volleyed the responsibility of making the next move back toward management.
“They have the ball,” she said. “It’s their turn. It is their turn to make a move. We’ve made moves. It is their turn. They have the ball, they have our proposal. It is their turn.”

WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — Lea Henderson expected the rent and utilities for the one-bedroom apartment she’s lived in for the past three years to go up 3% as defined in her annual lease.
So when Ledgeworks, the property management company based in Lebanon, sent her a lease renewal agreement in May that included a 20% rent hike for the unit at 112 South Main St. in downtown White River Junction near the Center for Cartoon Studies, Henderson, 26, was confused.
“Looks like there was a mistake here,” she wrote in a May 20 email to Ledgeworks, the company owned by Mike Davidson that manages his more than 300 residential units in the Upper Valley.
“I was expecting to sign a renewal for $1,287/month not $1,500/month. “
Cedar O’Dowd, 27, who’s lived for three years in a unit in 104 South Main St., the building next door to Henderson’s, is in the same position.
Both O’Dowd’s and Henderson’s leases, obtained by the Valley News, state: “the Base Rent shall be increased by 3% over the previous year’s Base Rent or by a percentage equal to the increase of the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U Boston) for the preceding year, whichever is greater.”

The CPI-U Boston was also 3% from May 2024 to May 2025, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But even after Henderson and O’Dowd both pointed out this clause in the lease, Ledgeworks refused to back down.
“The renewal we have sent you is the one we are still presenting to you. Please let us know your intentions,” a Ledgeworks employee wrote to Henderson on May 30.
The two residents reached out to several tenants rights organizations in Vermont and New Hampshire, but none could give a definitive answer as to whether raising the rent more than 3% is legal.

Because there is no binding legal precedent that interprets what the law is in this situation, “unfortunately, there isn’t a straightforward answer,” Rachel Batterson, an attorney at Vermont Legal Aid, said.
Since O’Dowd and Henderson’s leases expired July 31, it is unclear whether Ledgeworks could raise the rent more than 3% after the leases ended.
“I’m just not sure how a judge would interpret the actual situation where the (rent increase) notice was sent during the term of the lease while the 3% limitation was in,” Batterson said.
Ledgeworks put the 3% rent increase clause into the lease because the company tries “to be as predicable as possible for our residents and tenants,” Tim Sidore, Ledgeworks’ chief of operations, said in a Thursday phone interview.
“Typically, we try to keep increases as modest as possible, keeping in line with the cost of living and inflation,” he said. “Sometimes increases are higher than they are in other years.”
This year’s especially high rent increases are due to jumps in the cost of oil, propane, materials and labor, Sidore said.
“Given the dramatic rise of prices and inflation, rents must increase in order to cover costs,” he said.
The increases at the South Street buildings are meant to bring the units to “market rate.”
The units should cost closer to $1,645 a month, Sidore said. That rate would be considered affordable for someone making $61,450 a year, or 80% of the median income in Windsor County, according to the Vermont Housing Finance Authority.
Henderson, who works in the cafe at King Arthur Baking Company, makes about $44,000 a year.
“This apartment is not worth $1,500,” Henderson said in a phone interview last Thursday.
The units that O’Dowd and Henderson have lived in are both about 450 square feet, according to their leases.
“These are not luxury apartments,” a letter some tenants of the buildings wrote to Davidson in June said. “They are homes to low income and working class Vermonters who work in this community and whose labor local businesses benefit from.”
O’Dowd, a coordinator and producer at Junction Arts and Media, makes about $30,000 a year. They’ve lived in the one-bedroom unit with their ex-partner, who studied at The Center for Cartoon Studies when they first moved in. Their combined income is about $45,000 a year, O’Dowd said.
“This is the right apartment for artists in their 20s and it should be a price artists in their 20s can afford,” O’Dowd said in a phone interview last month.
The letter from the tenants also alleges the buildings are not in great condition and the apartments lack some amenities.
“At 112 S. Main St. there is no on-site laundry, and at 104 S. Main St. the laundry is coin-operated and the machines often break-down,” the letter said.
Complaints also included: siding falling off of 112 S. Main St.; fuel issues that led to lapses in heat and oven/stove usage; a shared dumpster often overflows; units do not include air conditioning and are “poorly insulated;” ventilation in the bathrooms is inadequate and ceilings regularly mold, the letter said.
Davidson did not respond to the letter, Henderson said. He also did not respond to the Valley News by deadline.
“We seek to address any reported maintenance issues in a timely manner,” Sidore said in an email to the Valley News.
In recent years, Davidson has renovated the interiors of both buildings, replaced the roof, installed skylights, replaced windows at 104 S. Main, installed a new heating system and fire sprinkler system at 112 S. Main and replaced siding on the front of 112 S. Main, Sidore said.
As a result of the rent increase, Henderson and O’Dowd decided to move out of the South Main Street buildings.
Through Henderson and O’Dowd’s personal connections in the area they found a two-bedroom apartment on Fairview Terrace, about half-a-mile from the South Main Street buildings.
The two signed a lease together for $1,050 a month, including heat and water, but not electricity and internet, Henderson said. It starts in September, O’Dowd said.
“I feel very lucky,” Henderson said.

Proposed ballot initiative aims to repeal Prop. 103, the California law that regulates home and auto insurance.


A proposed ballot initiative would drastically change the way property insurance is regulated in California by repealing a law voters passed almost four decades ago. 
Proposition 103 has regulated home, auto and other types of property and casualty insurance in the state since 1988. It requires insurance companies to seek approval from an elected insurance commissioner to raise their premiums, and allows members of the public to object to rate increases.
The initiative — which experts are calling a long shot — would throw all of that out. Insurance companies would not need the state’s approval to raise their policy holders’ premiums; the commissioner would be appointed by the governor instead of elected; and the public would no longer be able to intervene in rate filings.
The independent insurance agent who submitted the proposed measure, Elizabeth Hammack, wrote that she “has seen first-hand the dysfunction” that Prop. 103 has “wreaked upon our state.” Hammack did not immediately respond to CalMatters’ request for an interview.
Denni Ritter, a vice president for American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said the insurance industry group was not involved in drafting the measure and is “reserving judgment” while reviewing it.
To qualify for the November 2026 ballot, the initiative effort would need to collect more than half a million signatures by April.
If the initiative qualifies for next year’s ballot and is approved by voters, it could also throw a wrench into Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara’s plan to try to fix the state’s insurance market as insurers have refused to renew policies or write new ones as wildfire risk has grown. 
Lara crafted his plan around the confines of current insurance law while giving the insurance industry certain concessions, such as allowing them to use catastrophe modeling and to factor in their reinsurance costs when setting their rates. In exchange, the insurance department asks that insurers retain or increase their policies in areas considered at high risk for wildfires. The plan’s implementation began this year.
The insurance department did not immediately respond to questions about the proposal or how it would affect Lara’s plan.
Consumer Watchdog, the Los Angeles-based advocacy group whose founder wrote Prop. 103 mostly to address rising auto insurance rates, said in a statement that the proposal does not seem to be a “serious” or well-funded campaign. The group also cited a report that found Prop. 103 has saved California drivers more than $150 billion in auto insurance rates over the years, as well as a poll that found consumers blame insurance companies for rising premiums.
“We’re confident voters want more accountability from insurance companies,” Carmen Balber, the group’s executive director, told CalMatters. She said repealing Prop. 103 “would mean skyrocketing rates for home and auto insurance policy holders.”
Amy Bach, executive director of San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, said that while Prop. 103 has “important consumer protections,” the intervenor process has resulted in approval delays — which insurers have long complained about — and political pressure that have contributed to California’s problematic insurance market. 
“I don’t give the ballot measure a high degree of success,” Bach said. “People are not happy about escalating premiums.”
Another consumer advocacy group says Prop. 103 has helped keep California home and auto insurance rates lower than the national average. 
Consumer Federation of America, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy organization, “has studied state insurance markets for decades, and this initiative would institute the regulatory system used in states that have seen some of the most dramatic rate spikes around the country,” said Douglas Heller, director of insurance for the group. 
Heller added that California is not alone in facing an insurance crisis, and that “removing oversight of the insurance companies at this moment would be like shutting down the fire department in the middle of a blaze.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092622_PressConference_LJ_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 16:57:13.167358

Article Summary

Illinois has long had some of the most rigorous proficiency standards in the nation for student performance.
The Illinois State Board of Education is seeking to bring them closer to other states, which will boost proficiency scores in the upcoming school year.
Illinois’ superintendent of education says the strict standards result in schools being unfairly labeled as needing interventions and students being inaccurately labeled as not on track for college or a career.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – Education officials in Illinois expect to see a marked increase this year in the percentage of students classified as proficient in reading, writing and math, along with a slight decline in proficiency rates in science.
That’s not because of any change in the way schools are teaching or how well students are learning, but rather a change in the way the state reports scores on the annual assessments students are given in those core subjects.
During a media briefing Tuesday, State Superintendent of Education Tony Sanders said the new scoring system has been in development for about 18 months. Pending final approval by the State Board of Education, which is scheduled to vote Wednesday, the new grading system will be used in the 2025 report card that is due to be released this fall and will reflect scores from the tests students took this spring.
For years, those scores have been reported on the annual Illinois Report Card, which tells the public how students are performing overall, and which groups of students are falling behind. The scores are also used to hold schools accountable for improving student performance and bringing all demographic groups, including the most disadvantaged, up to proficiency.
But state officials have also complained for years that the way scores have been reported – and especially how scores are categorized as above or below the proficiency level – do not accurately reflect how well students are doing.
For example, recent report cards have shown that about two-thirds of Illinois high school graduates go on to enroll in a two- or four-year college within 12 months of graduation. But scores from the state assessments given each spring show fewer than half of them perform at grade level in English language arts, and even fewer are classified as proficient in math.

“Put simply, as currently designed, our proficiency rates do not reflect the reality of student progress,” Sanders said. “They’re misaligned with what it actually means to succeed in college and career.”
The inaccurate picture results from what are known as “cut scores” that divide students into different performance categories, Sanders said.
Federal law requires states to administer assessments and to report publicly how students are performing on those tests. But states are given great latitude in deciding where to draw the dividing lines between proficient and nonproficient, Sanders said. For many years, Illinois has had some of the most rigorous proficiency standards in the nation.
The consequences of that kind of scoring system go beyond merely unflattering report cards that show low percentages of students performing at grade level, he said. It also results in schools being unfairly labeled as needing interventions to improve their performance, and students themselves being inaccurately labeled as not on track for college or a career.
Proposed new system
Under the proposed new system, student scores will be divided into four performance categories: below proficient, approaching proficient, proficient, and above proficient. And a new system of cut scores will be used to separate students into those four categories.
The new scoring system will apply to the Illinois Assessment of Readiness, which covers English language arts and math in grades 3 through 8, as well as the Illinois Science Assessment, which is given to students in grades 5 and 8. It will also be used for the ACT exams, which will be used starting this year as the state assessment for students in 11th grade.
Sanders emphasized that because the state is establishing new performance categories and using new cut scores to define those categories, it will not be possible to compare proficiency rates under the new system with those of prior years.
“Proficiency rates in Illinois have been trending up, but on the 2025 report card, we will not be able to tell the magnitude of year-over-year improvement based on our proficiency data because 2025 sets a new baseline,” he said.
Instead, Sanders said, officials will compare future results with prior years using a metric called the Student Growth Percentile, which uses raw test scores to measure how much students have learned in a given year relative to their peers.

(Photo provided by the University of Louisville)LOUISVILLE — The University of Louisville announced an expansion of the U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell and Secretary Elaine L. Chao Archives with the political figures Tuesday. 
McConnell, the longest serving party leader of the U.S. Senate, graduated from the university in the 1960s and later established the McConnell Center, a nonpartisan academic program, for UofL students. The McConnell-Chao Archives were installed at the university in 2009 with a permanent gallery displaying exhibits, films and more about U.S. government, history and politics. 
The expansion increases the “capacity and functionality” of the archives, UofL said in a press release. Additions include an archive storage room to house collections of McConnell and Chao, a digital processing room, a new research carrel and an exhibit showcasing memorabilia related to the senator.

“I’ll say spending life with Elaine has been a blessing,” McConnell said during a ceremony with university officials and dignitaries. “Sharing this archive is an honor.” 
Chao is the first Asian American woman to serve in a cabinet-level position and held such a position in two presidential administrations. She was secretary for the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of Transportation. McConnell and Chao married in 1993. 
“Campaigning, for me, in every corner of Kentucky over the years to extend his leadership has been one of the greatest honors of my life, and I am so proud that with the expansion of this archive, his extraordinary accomplishments will continue to inform and inspire leaders for generations to come,” Chao said. 
McConnell, who has represented Kentucky in the Senate since 1984, is not seeking reelection next year. 
The expansion is not yet fully open to the public, but tours were available for those attending Tuesday’s ceremony. 
UofL President Gerry Bradley called the expansion “a meaningful milestone in the life of our campus and in the preservation of American political history” and thanked donors for supporting the project. UofL’s press release did not include the cost of the expansion. 
Bradley thanked McConnell for continued support for the university, including securing federal dollars over the years. The president also expressed gratitude for recent help from McConnell’s office with international students who temporarily lost their visas a few months ago. Bradley said “a call to Sen. McConnell’s office made that go away.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/54716704941_e8ec5e14b8_k-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-12 16:57:13.167358

Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025,  that Marx Development Group plans to buy four of West Virginia’s state-run long-term care facilities. (Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)The state of West Virginia has reached a deal with a New York-based development group to sell four state-run long-term care facilities for $60 million, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday.
Marx Development Group will purchase Hopemont Hospital in Terra Alta, Jackie Withrow Hospital in Beckley, John Manchin, Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont; and Lakin Hospital in West Columbia and make “significant” investments in the state, Morrisey said. 
“The sale of these facilities would produce a significant amount of revenue for the state, spur investment in the renovation and expansion of these facilities, and, I think, increase the level of quality of health care that’s provided to patients,” Morrisey said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon. “We also believe that all this can be done in a way that preserves many jobs and retaining a lot of the staff that have been working hard for many, many years to provide care for their fellow West Virginians.”
Together the facilities are licensed for about 500 beds. 
MDG owns and operates long-term care facilities in states in the region, according to a news release from Morrisey. Through its subsidiaries, Majestic Care and Bluegrass Consulting Group, it owns 55 properties with more than 5,000 licensed beds. 
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday afternoon. 
In July 2024, the state Department of Health Facilities announced a plan to sell the facilities, including hiring Lument Securities, LLC, a firm that advises in healthcare mergers and acquisitions.
Morrisey said the facilities all operate at a loss and would require the state to invest $100 million over the next few years to rebuild and renovate. 
“Furthermore, even if the state invested this money, the long term operating costs, they’re only going to continue to rise, but they’d rise without substantially improving the level of care that’s provided to the patients. Not a good mix,” he said.
The sale is expected to close Sept. 30 with a possible 30-day extension. 
As part of the deal, the company has agreed to build three to five new facilities to replace aging facilities and source the materials and labor from West Virginia, Morrisey said. 
Morrisey said the state continues to pursue the potential sale of its other facilities, which include 
Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital, Welch Community Hospital and William R. Sharpe Jr. Hospital. The long-term goal is to eliminate most of the need for the state’s Department of Health Facilities, he said.
“It’s no secret that I want to reduce the number of departments and reduce the number of agencies to drive efficiency,” he said. “So in consultation with the Legislature, I will be happy to have those conversations and look at different ways we can keep saving resources.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — As Oklahoma students return to school in the coming days, they’ll have backpacks on, pencils and laptops ready, and their cellphones out of sight.
For the next year, state law requires all Oklahoma public schools to ban student use of cellphones and personal electronic devices for the entire school day. The only devices exempt from the new law are ones that are school-issued, medically necessary or needed for emergencies.
Parents, students and educators across the state said they’re optimistic the cellphone ban will help limit distractions and keep classrooms focused on learning. But, they acknowledged the new ban could be a “challenge” to adjust to, especially during lunch and passing periods.
Some students at Classen High School of Advanced Studies at Northeast have gotten used to watching Netflix during their lunch hour or looking at social media during down time, said rising senior Amasha Samaraweera. This year, that won’t be an option.

Some teachers at the Oklahoma City high school already enforced a “phone jail” in their classrooms, but others had a more relaxed policy, said Samaraweera, who leads the Student Leadership Council in Oklahoma City Public Schools.
Oklahoma City is the largest school system in the state that didn’t have a districtwide cellphone restriction until state law changed this year. Several other Oklahoma districts — and 11 other states — had already implemented some version of the policy.
Samaraweera said she hopes the daylong ban will eliminate the temptation of Tik Tok when she has free time in the school day and force her to focus on homework and reading instead. Not all of her peers are happy with the change.
“We grew up with phones all of our lives so having it put away for eight hours a day, it can be a lot,” Samaraweera said. “I think it’s very valid for some students to feel a little bit concerned about this right now. But one big hope that I have for our student body is we’re extremely adaptable. We can change really fast. We can adapt to any sort of situation. So I’m sure that students over the years, over a course of time, they’ll get used to it.”
The district’s general counsel, Tony Childers, said he expects the policy change will be a struggle but a necessary one.
“I think it’ll be a challenge for students, but we also think it’s going to be beneficial for students,” Childers said during a back-to-school news conference Monday. “We think it’ll help us refocus in the classroom, for students to stay focused on what’s important without being too distracted by devices.”

Students already have enough screen time and distractions, even without cellphones during the school day, said Tarrah Ross, who has three children attending Broken Arrow Public Schools.
It wasn’t many years ago, she said, that her district urged families to buy students a cellphone so they could use it as a tool in the classroom. Ross said she’s glad the policy has since swung in the opposite direction.
What’s crucial, she said, is whether the cellphone ban will be applied consistently. One of her children, now a high school senior, complained that enforcement of his school’s cellphone restrictions varied from teacher to teacher.
“He’s like, ‘If everybody has to do it, fine, but if not everybody’s going to do it, then I want to be able to use it, too,’” Ross said.
The statewide ban on cellphones and personal devices won’t change much for Norman Public Schools parent Brent Norwood and his children. His fifth grader and sixth grader already are used to their school requiring cellphones to be put away.
“When we told them about this new policy, they were like, ‘I thought that was already the rule,’” he said.
Norwood said he hopes to see the long-term impact of the statewide policy when today’s middle and high school students arrive at the University of Oklahoma, where he teaches economics. He said he’s seen students become too dependent on personal devices, especially over the past five years.
The statewide cellphone ban won’t apply to colleges and universities, and Norwood doesn’t prohibit devices in his classes, either. 
But, he can’t help but notice how often students wear noise-canceling earphones, even when they visit him during his office hours. Spending less time plugged in and more time engaged would be a good thing, he said. 
At the K-12 level, he hopes students’ interpersonal skills get a boost with more face-to-face interaction.
“Less dependence on liking someone’s posts and more just going up and socializing at lunchtime, that’s what I’m hoping it does,” Norwood said.

(Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.

The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”

A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

There was little discussion Tuesday about the plan to consolidate the Missouri Schools for the Severely Disabled, or MSSD. Board members delved into the plan more thoroughly during a May meeting and a retreat last month.
“The State Board of Education believes this is the first step in providing more opportunities and strengthening education for all students enrolled in Missouri Schools for the Severely Disabled,” Board President Mary Schrag said in a news release. “This decision is not taken lightly but will result in a more efficient program that enriches quality resources provided to students and their families.”
The following schools will be required to close by the end of June 2026: Briarwood in Harrisonville, Citadel in Potosi, College View in Joplin, Crowley Ridge in Dexter, Delmar Cobble in Columbia, Dogwood Hills in Eldon, Gateway/Hubert Wheeler in St. Louis, Lakeview Woods in Lee’s Summit, Lillian Schaper in Bowling Green, Ozark Hills in Salem, Prairie View in Marshall and Rolling Meadow in Higginsville.
Six of the schools were already under “temporary emergency closure” because of staffing issues, impacting 61 students. The other six buildings set to close have a combined enrollment of 64 students and were at risk of emergency closure, Mark Wheatley, the department’s assistant commissioner of special education, told the board.
The change comes as MSSD struggles with declining enrollment, with 36% fewer students over the past 16 years, and $50 million in deferred maintenance between 34 school buildings.
A consultant hired by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education called the current program “unsustainable.”
Over the past two years, a committee has worked with consultants to give the program a direction. Their recommendation is to consolidate the schools, closing 24 existing buildings and constructing two new ones to condense the program to 12 locations.
Missouri is the only state that operates separate day schools for special education, though the practice was once commonplace nationwide.
Despite a nationwide push to better integrate students with learning disabilities, some parents say Missouri’s model works for their students. When consultants polled parents about their satisfaction, 85% said they felt that MSSD met their child’s needs better than previous schools.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051325_eslinger1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-12 16:57:13.167358

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. Coast Guard commissioned its first additional polar icebreaker in 25 years in Juneau on Sunday, marking what officials called a new era in Arctic activity for the United States.
The newly rechristened Storis, formerly the oilfield supply ship Aiviq, is the first in a series of icebreakers expected to join the Coast Guard in coming years. The Storis and subsequent ships, officials said, are critical for the United States to maintain its sovereignty and control of its borders in and near the Arctic Ocean.
“What we’re doing here today is we’re really just preparing to build our Arctic fighting force,” said Troy Edgar, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, parent agency of the Coast Guard.
Long trek to Lone Star State sparked plan for SC maritime academy

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was one of several members of Congress who secured funding for the Coast Guard to purchase the Storis for $125 million under a special contract and operating arrangement during the Biden administration. The purchase deal passed Congress after years of lobbying and political donations by the ship’s former owners.
The Aiviq, built to support Royal Dutch Shell’s oil drilling operations in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska, was available because of a disaster that saw Shell’s drilling rig break loose from the Aiviq during a 2013 storm in the Gulf of Alaska. The rig ran aground in the Kodiak archipelago and Shell abandoned its drill plans for the Arctic.
The Aiviq was modified after post-disaster reviews found flaws in its design, and it went on to serve under contract with the Australian government in Antarctica. Then, the U.S. government became interested in the ship to fill a gap in Arctic coverage.
The U.S. Navy has no icebreakers, which leaves the Coast Guard as the agency in charge of icebreaking operations, critical for opening frozen seas to commerce, research and military missions. The agency currently has just one heavy icebreaker, and that ship is typically assigned to help operations in Antarctica. That leaves the medium icebreaker Healy as the only U.S. icebreaker available for general-purpose missions in the Arctic.
A 2023 analysis by the Coast Guard concluded that the service needs eight to nine polar icebreakers, including four or five heavy ships and four or five medium ones to perform its assigned missions.
“I think Singapore has more icebreaking capacity than we do,” Sullivan said. “That has left us far behind our adversaries. Russia has more than 50 operational icebreakers, many nuclear-powered, many weaponized. China, which has no Arctic territory, is building a polar fleet and is spending a lot of time off our shores, including this summer.”
SC to finalize environmental cleanup of USS Yorktown

As Sullivan spoke, China is operating at least five research icebreakers in international waters near Alaska.
Capt. Corey Kerns is the ship’s first commanding officer, fresh from an assignment in Japan as a liaison officer with the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.
“For the Coast Guard, the big strategic thing is to show that we can operate it, get it up north, show the flag,” Kerns said.
During his time in Japan, he became familiar with the disputes over the Senkaku Islands, whose ownership is disputed among China, Taiwan and Japan.
Ships from all three nations visit the waters around those islands.
“The ability to be present guarantees your ability to to maintain sovereignty. And that’s what we’re trying to get at here in the Arctic. We need more icebreakers to be present in our waters and be clear what is our waters,” he said.
 First of many icebreakers planned for Coast Guard

In January, President Donald Trump said he would seek to acquire 40 Coast Guard icebreakers. The “Big Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July included almost $9 billion to build a series of heavy, medium and light ships.
Those include a series of heavy Arctic icebreakers larger than the Storis. The first of those, the Polar Sentinel, is expected to come from Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in 2030, with additional ships every two years afterward.
“This is an amazing moment, because it doesn’t happen that often, but it’s going to be happening a lot more,” said acting Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Kevin E. Lunday.

The Storis is scheduled to be homeported in Juneau, where Sunday’s commissioning took place, but not for several years. For the time being, it will be homeported in Seattle, Washington.
Sullivan, speaking at the commissioning, said he would like to see the new ships homeported in Alaska as well — it’s where the ice is, he said to applause.
The Trump-signed budget measure includes $300 million for a new Coast Guard pier and other facilities in Juneau; construction has not begun, and no site has been finalized.
Both the Storis and the under-construction heavy icebreakers are too large to fit in the Coast Guard’s Kodiak base or in any port north of the Aleutian Islands. The Storis draws 34 feet, according to specifications published in 2013. The new heavy icebreakers are expected to have a similar draft. Either figure is deeper than what’s available in northern Alaska right now.
By the book, said Cmdr. Philip Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, it takes the Coast Guard eight to 10 years to set up a new port from the time it’s chosen.
“We want to move much faster, but there’s a lot of work that has to be done to build out the pier and the shore infrastructure,” Lunday said.
He said things like housing and child care need to be available to accommodate Coast Guard personnel.
Currently, Juneau is experiencing major shortages of both.
“I chair the Coast Guard subcommittee,” Sullivan said, “so working with the Coast Guard, working with Juneau, working with the state, we’re going to press this. We’ve already made good progress on that.”
 Additional work needed aboard Storis

The Storis, too, will need work and testing before it can fully perform its duties. During a pre-commissioning cruise on Saturday for members of the media and the families of the crew, one of the ship’s variable-pitch propellers malfunctioned, helping turn a planned five-hour excursion into an eight-hour one.
The malfunction was a minor one, but fixing it may have required turning off main power for a time, the ship’s captain said, and he didn’t want to do that while families were aboard.
The Storis has a helipad, but a Coast Guard helicopter has never landed there, tried a mid-air hoist, or refueled from the ship. Some labels throughout the ship still bear the name Aiviq, and the ship’s interior art includes photos from Louisiana bayous and New Orleans streets. In the ship’s mess hall are condiments bearing the names of southern grocery stores.

On Saturday’s cruise, employees from Edison Chouest Offshore, the company that formerly owned the Storis, stood alongside uniformed Coast Guard officers on the ship’s bridge.
“He’s my coach,” said Lt. j.g. Sophia Scott of chief mate Devin Keister, who wore civilian clothes next to her.
Since the spring, employees from Edison Chouest have been operating the Storis alongside enlisted Coast Guard members and officers, a unique setup for a Coast Guard ship.
Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, helped organize the purchase of the Storis and the sprint to get it ready.
“I’ll never forget March 4 of 2025 when Admiral Lunday, our acting Commandant of the Coast Guard, directed me and my team to prepare Storis for operations and to sail away from Pascagoula, Mississippi, where the ship had been purchased and put into storage, no later than 1 June of 2025. I’m no mathematician, but that’s less than 60 days later, and at that point, zero crew members had reported aboard,” he said.
After sailing away, the ship spent another two weeks in Seattle for additional work, then arrived in Juneau during the first week of August.
Lunday said the Coast Guard’s partnership with Edison Chouest enabled the Coast Guard to put the Storis in service “much faster than we would have traditionally done.”
“The imperative,” Lunday said, “is that we build out the nation’s icebreaker fleet. When we see the potential adversaries that are moving to build their icebreakers, we’ve got to move faster as the United States, and we’re going to do that. … The original plan was not to have Storis up here for another year, but the national imperative was to move faster, and so that’s why it’s here.”
 Storis has a mixed history

In 2012, while towing the circular drill rig Kulluk from the Arctic Ocean to Seattle, the Aiviq ran into a heavy storm south of Kodiak. The ship’s engines died, the tow line broke, and the Kulluk ran aground after the Aiviq’s crew was unable to re-establish the tow.
No oil spill resulted and no one was injured, but it contributed to Shell’s decision to abandon its Arctic drilling plans.
Two years later, the Coast Guard published a report on the accident, concluding that actions by the tow crew, management decisions and “design engineering deficiencies … relating to the Aiviq” contributed to the wreck.

Specifically, the report noted that vents allowed seawater to contaminate the ship’s fuel.
Since then, those vents have been modified, raised farther above the deck, and the ship went on to conduct two successful voyages to Antarctica. The ship is rated to break three feet of ice while moving at five knots, but during those trips, it was able to break between three and five feet while still moving forward, Baxa said.
After Shell discontinued its Alaska offshore drilling, Edison Chouest lobbied members of Congress and urged lawmakers to purchase the Aiviq for use by the federal government.
The Coast Guard initially resisted. In a 2016 hearing of the U.S. House’s Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, then-Coast Guard Vice Commandant Charles Michel told lawmakers that “our current opinion is that the ship is not suitable for military service, without substantial refit.”
Then-Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, called Michel’s statement a “bulls**t answer” because the Aiviq would be asked to move ice, not perform military duties.
In 2022, after Young’s death in office, Congress passed the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act, which approved funding for the Coast Guard to buy a “United States built available icebreaker.”
The Coast Guard, which had been considering a Finland-built ship, switched to the Aiviq as the only available ship that met Congress’ qualifications.
Subsequent reporting by ProPublica showed an extensive history of political donations by Edison Chouest to members of Congress, including Alaska’s delegation.
“It is ready for Coast Guard service,” Lunday said of the Aiviq-turned-Storis when asked about the July 2016 hearing that labeled the Aiviq as unfit.
“We’ve learned a lot since then, and we’ve had great support from Congress to have the appropriations necessary last year to purchase the ship,” he said.
Sullivan, among the members of Congress who received contributions from Edison Chouest, denied that those donations contributed to the decision to purchase the Aiviq.
“It has nothing to do with it,” Sullivan said. “Zero. I’ve been pressing for more icebreakers any way possible for our country … and the Coast Guard was looking at the idea of a commercially available one.”
 New ship carries relics of prior history

The new Storis is named after its predecessor, an icebreaker that was commissioned in 1942 and served until 2007, becoming the oldest commissioned Coast Guard cutter in the fleet at the time of its decommissioning and scrapping.
In 1957, it and several other ships sailed through the Northwest Passage, marking the first time an American ship had taken that route.
Thirty-two years after that historic voyage, the Storis assisted with the cleanup after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Ed Sasser was a crewman on board at the time. On Saturday, he sailed aboard the new edition of his former ship.
“It’s pretty cushy compared to the old Storis,” he said, noting that both ships were and are unique vessels, not part of a larger class of ships.
If he were young again, he’d serve aboard the new ship “in a New York minute.”
“Time will tell how useful it is,” he said.

Remnants of the ship’s former life remain obvious throughout.
Belowdecks are large steel containers, intended to haul bulk dry concrete or other material to offshore oil fields. For now, they’re empty until the Coast Guard either removes them or finds a use for them.
Other pieces of the Storis’ original purpose could be useful to its new mission. Its stern holds heavy-duty towing gear, and large firefighting cannons jut from its superstructure.
The ship has no internal laboratory space, as does the Coast Guard’s other medium icebreaker, the Healy, but it does have deck attachments for container modules that could allow it to accommodate labs.
Already, one of those spaces was in use Sunday, holding the ship’s brand-new armory, including four .50-caliber machine guns.
“I’ve made this joke for many, many years … it’s that if you can imagine it, and you can put it into a standard 20-foot IMO container, I can embark it on board. … we had on board a very, very senior Marine Corps officer, and he asked, ‘hey, what if I put a Marine Raider team in a box?’ I said, ‘Yes, sir, I can embark that on board.’ It really does provide that flexibility for missions,” Baxa said.
The Coast Guard’s staffing contract with Edison Chouest is scheduled to run through November, and it could be extended for one year.
Both Baxa and the ship’s captain said they’ll be recommending that extension.
Lt. Cmdr. George Greendyk, the engineer officer on board the Storis, said he hasn’t had problems with the Edison Chouest civilian crew.
“Everywhere we go, we have people that have seen something like this before, and they’ve been certainly helpful answering questions for us and guiding us as we run the engineering plant,” he said.
“Right now, our primary mission is to just focus on learning the ship, training, preparing our policy and procedures,” said Lt. D.J. Corbett, the ship’s operations officer.
Corbett said that over the next two months, the Storis will head west, to Kodiak, then through the Bering Sea and north, through the Bering Strait. The ship’s port calls are still being finalized.
Corbett said being aboard an icebreaker means being able to see and do things that no other Coast Guard cutter experiences.
“I still remember the first time that I ever saw ice,” she said. “We were going down south. We had crossed the Antarctic Circle, and all of these massive icebergs just started flowing past us. And then we had right whales that were popping up and coming to see the ship. We had orcas. It was our last sunset. As we were heading south, it would be 24 hours of sunlight. So all of this was happening, the sun was setting, and then we saw a green flash that night. At first, we didn’t believe it. We were like, Did everyone see that? And so it was my moment of, I’m living in a National Geographic special. It was really amazing.”
 The ship’s first captain looks ahead

Kearns, the ship’s first captain, is an officer who started as an enlisted man in 1996 and rose through the ranks, later earning degrees in ship design. He helped design a new class of icebreakers for the Great Lakes and served as the Coast Guard’s liaison to the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet, which patrols the western Pacific.

“Normally, you start off a ship designed by (the question): What capabilities are you trying to achieve? In this case, we need Arctic presence. That was the most important thing. So we’re willing to take some risk or we’re forced into it because our shipbuilding projects are so behind,” he said.
Critically for the ship’s future, he said, is to come up with the equivalent of the ship’s operating manual. Coast Guard officers are trained to run ships, but the Storis is unique.
“What are all the things you need to learn to do the same job on Storis? And then run all of our people through that. … I think success will be when we get all of that documentation done and then get all of our watchstanders what would be considered fully qualified,” he said.
Kerns acknowledged that there are some people who would prefer that the Storis jump quickly into law enforcement, fisheries patrols and search and rescue. He prefers a slower pace.
“We need to learn how to crawl. And that’s what we’re doing, Kerns said.
For example, the crew of the Storis hasn’t yet launched the ship’s small craft, which are stored in bays along the side of the hull, in open water.
The newly opened National Medal of Honor Museum in Texas has SC roots

“We’ve just started to gain proficiency in launching that in protected, calm seas. So next would be, what does it look like to launch that in open water? And then how do we need to drive the ship from the bridge to create the right conditions to safely launch that boat? And then that would help us build into, ‘Oh, this is how we would  perform Coast Guard mission sets.’”
Asked about the ship’s history, the critical 2014 report and whether he has safety concerns, he said no.
“I have no concerns. I feel totally safe on Storis,” Kerns said.
He said he’s familiar with reporting that analyzed what went wrong with the Aiviq and why it was unable to keep the Kulluk from running aground.
“It easily gets attributed to design flaws for the ship, which is a little bit misleading. In extreme weather, every ship has design flaws. There’s constraints on operations. Ships are designed to operate in certain conditions to a certain extent, and if you operate the ship past those constraints, you’re going to find out what’s going to fail first,” he said.
Some engineering changes were made after the Kulluk accident — the Aiviq’s fuel vents were raised, “which means you can take more water in the vicinity of them before it would down-flood. It’s not that it couldn’t possibly happen again, but it’s less likely.”
Kerns said the “creature comforts” aboard the ship are the most easily noticeable difference from a purpose-built Coast Guard ship.
The Storis has heated handrails, walkways and exterior stairs, a feature intended to eliminate the need for crew to beat ice away as it forms.
“There’s a lot of automation in places that we might not use it, because we use manpower instead,” he said.
Kerns said he’s also been impressed with the ship’s multiple redundancies.
“Almost every system has backups to the backups. They really thought about this thing being in the Arctic and independent and away from logistical support. There’s different ways to make water. There’s ways to handle sewage. I actually feel very comfortable with what the capabilities are,” he said.
“I’m definitely looking forward to doing ice breaking on this thing. It’s a lot of fun to drive,” Kerns said.

(Photo by Bob Daemmrich for The Texas Tribune)The Texas for All Coalition announced that three Florida cities will participate in a National Day of Action Saturday designed to stop the Donald Trump-inspired redistricting plan before the 2026 midterm elections.
There will be rallies in Palm Coast, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee, an interactive map indicates. 

The 90-minute Tallahassee rally starts at 9 a.m. The address isn’t public and available only to those who register. 
The one-hour Palm Coast rally is being held at Old Kings Road & Palm Coast Parkway Southeast and begins at 11 a.m.  
Meanwhile, the Jacksonville rally starts at 11 a.m. at 5945 New Kings Road, Jacksonville, and is slated to last 90 minutes.


The Texas for All Coalition’s goal is to mobilize as many rallies nationally as possible, and the group created FightTheTrumpTakeover.com as a digital headquarters.
“Across Texas, and across the country, communities are speaking out in a united voice to call for an end to the Trump takeover,” Drucilla Tigner, executive director of Texas For All, said in a prepared statement.
The announcement comes as the Texas Senate approved new congressional lines in a mid-decade redistricting effort that could help Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 election, the Texas Tribune reported Tuesday. 
“The vote was 19-2, with nine Democrats absent after exiting the Senate floor moments after the maps were taken up, a show of protest against what they framed as a ‘corrupt process,’ ” the Tribune reported.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Dozens of Texas House Democrats left for Illinois and other parts of the country, bringing work on redistricting in that chamber to a halt as the chamber continues to lack the minimum headcount needed to conduct business.
  Protests are planned in these Florida cities.
Trump, concerned Republicans could lose control of the House of Representatives after next year’s midterm elections, called on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last month to add new GOP seats.
Once Abbott agreed to do that, however, the gears began working in other states — blue and red — to follow suit.

Ron DeSantis said last month that his state had been “malapportioned” — and has touched on the need to redraw congressional districts since a Florida Supreme Court ruling upholding a map promoted by the governor that ultimately netted Florida four additional GOP seats and eliminated Black representation in North Florida.
Writing for the majority in that case, Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz concluded that legislators had a “superior” obligation to follow federal equal-protection law, and not Florida’s Fair Districts Amendments, which say districts can’t be drawn in a way that diminishes the ability of minorities to “elect representatives of their choice.” 
House Speaker Daniel Perez also appears on board and announced last week that he’s creating a Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting, with the goal of conducting hearings when the Legislature returns this fall for its already scheduled committee meetings.
“As many of you are aware, there are national conversations ongoing in other states related to midterm redistricting,” Perez wrote in a memo to members of the Florida House.

The Office of Management and Enterprise Services in a message to stakeholders said it was investigating network service issues statewide affecting multiple agencies.
The office was working on a resolution, the message said.
“We are currently investigating and have determined this as not a breach of state systems,” said Christa Helfrey, OMES spokeswoman. “Each agency determines its work schedule and when to adjust daily operations.”
The Oklahoma Department of Labor and  Oklahoma Ethics Commission closed early, according to the agencies.
The Oklahoma Department of Corrections sent administrative staff home early, said Kay Thompson, a spokeswoman.
Department of Corrections facilities saw minimal disruptions, she said.
Tuesday was election day for 22 counties.
“It is not impacting our elections today,” said Misha Mohr, a spokeswoman.
The Pardon and Parole Board was not able to connect with DOC facilities where inmates were scheduled to make personal appearances, said Tom Bates, executive director.
But the agency was able to continue with its business because attorneys were able to speak on the offenders’ behalf, he said.
Some staff at the Oklahoma Attorney General’s office went home early to continue working, said Phil Bacharach, a spokesman.
The outage did cause delays in some of the agency’s work, he said.

Katie Hobbs met with Indigenous healthcare officials and traditional practitioners during a roundtable discussion on Aug. 8, 2025, about Arizona’s traditional healing Medicaid benefits. (Photo by Shondiin Silversmith/Arizona Mirror)The effort to secure coverage for traditional healing services for Indigenous peoples across Arizona started over 10 years ago, with many health care professionals working to improve access for patients seeking alternatives to Western medicine.
“It was a long time coming,” Terrilynn Nez-Chee said.
Nez-Chee is Navajo and the director of revenue cycle management for the Tse’hootsooi’ Medical Center in Fort Defiance. She also serves as the chair of the Traditional Healing Workgroup for the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System.
“It was a long journey,” she added, but all the work put in was worth it.



Offering more access to traditional healing practices through the state’s Medicaid program is a significant win for people seeking such services through the Indian Health Service or a tribally operated health facility.
The Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, or AHCCCS, is the state’s Medicaid program and provides health care coverage for about two million Arizonans — about 28% of the state’s residents — including 167,000 Native Americans.
AHCCCS received approval in October from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to cover traditional healing services provided through the Indian Health Service and tribally operated health facilities in Arizona.
Arizona is one of only four states that have received federal approval to cover traditional healing practices as a Medicaid benefit, joining California, New Mexico and Oregon.
Indigenous traditional healing is a comprehensive medical system encompassing a range of holistic treatments used by Indigenous healers to treat various acute and chronic conditions, as well as to promote health and well-being, according to the National Institutes of Health/National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
After federal approval, Gov. Katie Hobbs allocated $100,000 from the state to secure over $222 million in federal matching funds for culturally relevant traditional healing practices.
“Through our bipartisan balanced budget, we’re able to secure the necessary state funds to be able to draw down the federal funds to cover traditional healing,” Hobbs said, adding that she understands many people have advocated for decades to get the service covered.
Hobbs held a roundtable discussion with health care officials and traditional practitioners at the Center for Native American and Indigenous Futures at NAU on Aug. 8.
Hobbs heard what traditional healing means for the Navajo Nation and White Mountain Apache Tribe, the two tribes present for the roundtable.
“I am committed to ensuring that health care is accessible to Arizonans across the state, and that those deeply personal health care decisions are able to happen in the way that meets everyone’s needs,” she said. “This is a huge step forward in doing that.”
Ann Marie Chischilly, the vice president of Native American Initiatives at NAU, said Hobbs’ administration has demonstrated a strong commitment to supporting Indigenous peoples across Arizona, and her work will leave a lasting impact on the communities.
Traditional healing practices vary across tribal nations, but some standard practices include sweat lodges, prayers, talking circles and ceremonial rituals.
Chischilly said that Indigenous medicine people and traditional knowledge holders have always been “our original healers and our scientists.”
“Your steadfast commitment from time immemorial to our ways of healing is deeply honored,” she added. “We’re proud to live in a time where both Western science and Indigenous knowledges are increasingly recognized and respected as equals.”
Funding for traditional healing services provided by the Indian Health Service or tribally operated health care facilities will be 100% reimbursed by the federal government.
The state would need to pay for reimbursements involving non-Native family members of Indigenous people covered by Medicaid who receive their health care from Indigenous providers.
Even though traditional healing services have not been covered under federal programs like Medicaid previously, many health care facilities in tribal communities continue to offer these services to Indigenous patients.
For Nez-Chee, having coverage for traditional healing methods in Arizona fills that access need but also creates a path to educating young generations.
“It’s more than reimbursement, it’s reeducating and regrowing our tradition and our culture,” Nez-Chee said. “It’s a community development.”
She said that improved community understanding and access to traditional healing help people understand its role in the daily lives of many Indigenous people.
As the state moves forward, Nez-Chee said that the workgroup is trying to ensure that the process includes all 22 tribes in Arizona because they understand that each tribe is “very unique in their culture and tradition.”
“We made it to where it would be open-ended, to where they can tailor and customize the purpose of the reimbursement with their organizations and healthcare,” she said, adding that this allows healthcare providers to involve the community, traditional practitioners, and physicians in the process.
Now that traditional healing practices are covered, Nez-Chee said the work begins for everyone to engage with their community to let them know about these services within their health care facilities.
For the White Mountain Apache Tribe, Michael Tate said they are actively working to include traditional healing services within their care efforts for both behavioral and physical health.
“This is a big milestone for all tribes,” he said, because it shows that traditional healers are equivalent to what a doctor is in the system.
Tate is the chief executive officer for the White Mountain Apache Behavioral Health Services and has been actively working to secure access to traditional healing services since 2019.
“We’ve always had the option, regardless of us getting reimbursed,” Tate said. “We covered the service.”
The tribe does not have traditional practitioners on staff, and when patients request services, Tate said they usually rely on the patient to select who they want to provide that service from within the community.
Traditional healing services are not widely used within the hospital setting for the White Mountain Tribe. Tate said that it is most likely due to the fact that it is a very private experience and many don’t want to share that information openly with a health care provider.
The traditional practices aren’t meant to be written down or shared publicly, and Tate said their tribe is very concerned about that potentially happening because their communities have been taken advantage of before.
“We don’t want this to be a big fraud,” he said, explaining that the sober living facilities scam is what drives this caution because a lot of Indigenous people were exploited, especially from the White Mountain Apache Tribe.
“Organizations who are not good might take advantage of this program,” Tate said. “We don’t want this to be bigger than it needs to be.”
Tate said that the White Mountain Apache people need the service and he just wants to make sure that it is being provided for the right reasons.
“There’s always gonna be bad actors out there that’re gonna try to take advantage of this,” he said. “We need to protect our own teachings, our own way of life.”
Tate shared his concerns about the possibility of fraudulent scams happening with Hobbs and her staff during the roundtable discussion.
Zaida Dedolph Piecoro, the governor’s state health strategist, said that since the benefit is specifically for tribal health facilities, only those providers can bill for the service.
AHCCCS will not determine who traditional practitioners are or who they can reimburse, she said, because it was vital to ensure that the benefit remained about the healing practices being self-directed and self-determined.
“It’s determined by tribal leadership and determined by tribal health facilities,” Piecoro said, adding that someone can not just walk into a tribal health facility and tell them they want to provide traditional services.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis selected Republican state Sen. Jay Collins to be his next lieutenant governor on Tuesday, immediately leading to speculation that the retired Army Green Beret could be the candidate to run for governor in 2026 and continue the DeSantis legacy.
Collins, 49, had been rumored to be the pick to succeed Jeanette Nuñez for months, telling the Phoenix in May that were his name in the mix, “that’s an incredible honor.”
Speaking at the Green Beret Association in Tampa just north of MacDill Air Force Base, DeSantis said he looked for a lieutenant governor who could help deliver “more wins” for Floridians and be capable of leading the state should he leave his job before he is term-limited out of office in January 2027.
“You have to be strong on policy and you have to have a record of delivering big, conservative results,” DeSantis said.
“You’ve got to have a foundation of conservative principles. Rudderless ships will never find true north, and it’s very important that people bring with that, because we can talk about issues right now. A year from now into the future, you don’t know what’s going to go your way, so what are you going to look to as your frame of reference as you tackle big issues.”
The governor referenced Collins’ military career, including his service as a Special Forces medic in the U.S. Army and later as a member of the Green Berets. He was deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and twice to South America. He was awarded a Purple Heart and sustained injuries that led to the amputation of a leg.
Collins works as chief operating officer for Operation BBQ Relief, which distributes meals to Americans following natural disasters. In June, he traveled to the Middle East to help Floridians return to the United States during a military conflict between Israel and Iran.
“He was in these countries during the middle of a war, personally helping to rescue his fellow Floridians and fellow Americans,” DeSantis said. “Sen. Jay Collins is the Chuck Norris of Florida politics.”
In his speech, Collins thanked DeSantis, calling him “The GOAT,” and used military argot in describing how he plans to address his role as the state’s new lieutenant governor.
“The battlefield, it may change, but the mission stays the same,” he said. “We are going to protect and preserve every single thing that matters. We will not stop our fight. We will not slow down, we will continue to take the fight forward, because this is not politics, it is about people. It is about the people who are in this audience, the people we fight for, and the people we remember each and every day.”
Collins promised to be “relentless in the pursuit of excellence.”
“Excellence is a choice. We will not falter. We will not fail. We will not stop. Until we keep fighting and achieve excellence, all we do is the Florida standard, and that is my promise to you, governor.”
Political background
Collins, a resident of Hillsborough County, first came on the political scene in 2021, when he announced he would challenge Democrat Kathy Castor for Congress.
Shortly after that, DeSantis himself recruited Collins to skip that race and instead run for the District 14 state Senate seat in 2022 that had been held by Democrat Janet Cruz. Collins went on to defeat Cruz by 10 percentage points and quickly became a close political ally of the governor.
He has been a consistently conservative voice in the Senate since then. Among the bills he has championed was legislation to repeal the state law that bans the purchase of a long gun for anyone under 21 years of age. It passed the House but languished in the Senate.
He’s been a stalwart supporter of Hope Florida, the community-based welfare program initiated by First Lady Casey DeSantis that came under fire earlier this year and whose foundation is reportedly being investigated by state prosecutors.
The question on everyone’s minds during Tuesday’s press conference (which Casey DeSantis — for a while all but promoted by the governor as a possible successor — attended) is whether Collins would run for governor of Florida next year, taking on U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump and has raised more than $22 million.
Neither DeSantis nor Collins took questions from news reporters following the press conference. Collins did tell a group of reporters earlier this month in Orlando that while he would not say whether he would enter the race, he did believe that some other Republican needed to take on Donalds.
“I think competition’s good for anybody,” he said. “And look, I don’t want anybody to say anything. I have no umbrage with Byron. I don’t. I believe we should have a choice. Byron is a conservative leader. His family have done great things in the community. And, in the end, you know, what I think our government, our people, our world works better with choice, and we will see where life goes, but, in the end, we’re going to be okay. Florida’s in a great position.”
Donalds congratulated Collins on being appointed lieutenant governor, writing on X, “I wish him all the best and look forward to working together on behalf of our great state.”
‘Performative’ politics
DeSantis has made it clear that he is looking to support someone other than Donalds next year.
“Politics has become so performative, we often lose sight of why you’re really there,” he said at one point Tuesday in praise of Collins.
“It’s not to emote on social media. It’s not to get on as many TV shows as possible. Jay embodies one of our core principals. While words can be meaningful, it’s ultimately deeds that are the most powerful. You’re in office to deliver results for the people who put you there, not to serve your own personal interests. And I think that Jay’s life story has been the embodiment of that.”
Not everyone was in support of the pick.
DeSantis Watch, an organization critical of the governor, issued a statement contending that “the list of politicians willing to be associated with his failed agenda of higher costs and fewer freedoms has dwindled.”
“With the selection of Jay Collins it is clear the only supposed allies the Governor has left are other politicians looking to play on his own narcissistic need for complete and total fealty to advance their own quests for higher office,” DeSantis Watch communications director Anders Croy said.
“It is a testament to how Ron DeSantis views his job as an elected official that the qualifications for a constitutional officer are not whether you have real solutions to lower costs or raise wages for Floridians, but whether you’re willing to stand beside his administration as its last days are defined by bullying, corruption, and political ambition over doing what’s right for the hardworking people of our state.”
Several Republican legislators were on hand, including Panhandle Rep. Michelle Salzman, who, like Collins, served in the U.S. Army. She said it was important for her to travel to Tampa to observe the event. But she evaded the question of whether she would support Collins if he runs for governor.
“I’m going to let him decide that,” she said while laughing. “I don’t want to get into the middle of all of that. But I am very excited for him. I love him very much. He’s a phenomenal leader.”

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)The Nevada Republican Party thinks the state should build its own high-security immigration detention center and name it “Coyote Compound.”
The party sent a fundraising email Aug. 8 asking if Nevada should follow Florida’s example and construct its own detention facility.
“Florida has Alligator Alcatraz — a high-security ICE detention center designed to detain and process illegal immigrants quickly and efficiently,” reads the email. “Now, we’re asking: Should Nevada have something similar? We’re calling it the Coyote Compound, and it would send a clear message: Nevada takes border security seriously.”
After the email heavily suggests what readers’ answers should be, the email urges readers to click a link to take a poll. And after submitting their preference for the “Coyote Compound” (“Yes,” “No,” or “I’m not sure”) readers are directed to a page where they’re invited to donate money to the party.
The state Republican Party, which did not respond to a request for comment, may have been more focused on raising money for itself instead of actually galvanizing government and community support for construction of a much-maligned — and expensive — detention camp.
The detention center in Florida’s Everglades was opened last month. The hastily built facility, which is expected to hold up to 5,000 beds, has been heavily criticized for abhorrent conditions, a lack of transparency concerning practices and detainees, and environmental concerns.
The ACLU has also warned of reports where people who are detained there “are fed maggot-infested food, denied medical care, not given access to water, flushing toilets, or showers, and are not allowed to go outside.”
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized $245 million in funding, provided by Florida taxpayers, to get the facility up and running.
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo and Republican state Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus did not respond to requests for comment.
“The crisis at the border isn’t just a border state problem anymore, it’s a national emergency, and Nevada needs to be part of the solution,” the Nevada Republican Party asserted in its email.
That claim seems to be at odds with Trump, who recently asserted “We now have the most secure border in modern American history.”
The email from the state Republican Party advocating a Florida-style immigration detention camp happened to be sent the same day Lombardo confirmed he would authorize the Nevada National Guard to assist with President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda.
Laura Martin, the executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada and a steering committee member of the Nevada Immigrant Coalition decried the Republican Party’s push, even if only in a fundraising email, for a “Coyote Compound.”
“Joe Lombardo is the de facto leader of the Nevada Republican party and this kind of violent, racist rhetoric is exactly what is taking our state down a path of economic collapse,” Martin said. “Nevadans deserve strong leadership that respects all residents, not culture war-chasing gimmicks designed to remind people why our nickname is the Mississippi of the West.”

On Feb. 14, Congress approved a 90% reduction in funding for the healthcare navigators, which had started as the country approved the Affordable Care Act. Those navigators are part of the “Cover Montana” program. Those changes will begin at the end of this month when the funding for the navigator program runs out. These navigators, both in person and via the phone, have helped thousands of Montanans get signed up for healthcare, whether through the healthcare.gov website, or begin the Medicaid process.
For example, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit, navigators also helped people enroll in federal health insurance. As redetermination happened — a process of reverifying a resident’s eligibility for programs like Medicaid — navigators were there for that, too.
But beginning in September, the navigator pool in Montana will shrink by around 90%, as federal funding has left the Montana Primary Care Association, which runs the “Cover Montana” program and its team of navigators with no other choice than layoffs. Olivia Riutta, who manages the state’s navigators, said seven full-time staff members will lose their jobs as well as some contracted employees who work with residents to navigate the healthcare system in the Treasure State.
 

  Federal fallout: Medicaid and insurance in Montana 

The Daily Montanan is launching a series of articles that breaks down some of the biggest changes implemented by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in the so-called “Big, beautiful bill.”
All four members of Montana’s Congressional delegation — Republicans Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke — voted for these changes. 
Today’s stories are the second installment:
Navigators no more: In February, Congress also voted to defund most of the health insurance navigators at the state level. In Montana, 90% of the navigators won’t be available after many of these changes become reality, leaving residents to answer questions on their own, or try their luck accessing one of the few left after the cuts. These navigators helped residents find insurance, understand their eligibility and explain policy differences. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Less leeway: States like Montana had previously come up with their own work eligibility and verification programs. But with the new Trump rules surrounding Medicaid, that means states have less flexibility and fewer resources to navigate the changes (Story by KFF Health News)
Our previous stories have included:  
Another big change in the Big Sky: Whether you’re one of more than 100,000 people on Medicaid or whether you purchase your health insurance on the marketplace (healthcare.gov), recent federal changes will mean a decrease in people who qualify under expanded Medicaid, as well as hefty health insurance premium hikes from those who purchase a plan. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Is $50 billion enough: Congress has allocated $50 billion to be used for rural state hospitals, which had been identified as particularly vulnerable in the “Big, beautiful” bill. Republicans from rural states demanded the money in exchange for the support, but will the fund be enough? And, what happens after it’s depleted? (Story by Stateline)



Though the cuts will decimate the program, it won’t leave it completely shuttered. Riutta said they’ll still be able to continue a phone hotline for people who need help, but that could come with longer wait times and no face-to-face contact. In the remaining days of August, while the funding is still in place, the team is also putting together online materials that could help residents manage the sometimes tricky world of health insurances.

Riutta said the first Donald Trump administration had also cut back on healthcare navigators, so it wasn’t surprising to see another cut. During the Joe Biden administration, those cuts were restored and, in some cases, expanded.
However, Montana has also been a success story. Before Medicaid expansion, the state claimed one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. Since then, navigators helped more than 77,000 residents enroll in insurance, according to the Cover Montana. Still, many of those changes could be undercut by upcoming changes made through the “big, beautiful bill” Congress passed. Those changes include the elimination of enhanced tax credits for health insurance on the federal marketplace, and now more onerous work requirements for those enrolled in Medicaid. Those changes, Riutta said, could leave many people confused.
“We won’t have the same capacity as open enrollment happens and, at the same time, there are big changes coming,” she said. “What we know is that for folks to enroll and effectively use coverage, they often need someone to walk alongside them and show them the process.
“It will be really sad that we won’t be able to help with that.”
Currently, Riutta’s teams are spread throughout the state to help Montanans navigate the changes face to face. Those teams will cease operations.
“Our capacity will be limited, and let’s face it: Some folks are just better suited to in-person visits,” Riutta said.
She said the navigators have also been a helpful resource as the healthcare context changed. For example, when the Affordable Care Act rolled out, residents had to learn about the marketplace; when Medicaid expanded in Montana, navigators helped with eligibility; when COVID-19 changed insurance programs, navigators were there, and even as the redetermination process upended some of the system, navigators helped make sure coverage was re-established for those who needed it.
“We were just able to spend time and get residents were comfortable,” Riutta said.
She said sometimes navigators are residents’ last stop before giving up on insurance — something that could leave them vulnerable in the future.
“People want to call someone in their community. They want to go down the road or meet face to face because it’s complicated and complex,” she said. “There have always been ongoing changes. We are expecting more Montanans to have questions.
“If we want Montanans to have health insurance so that they get preventative services and get established with a primary care provider, then we need to take time for what they need and how to enroll. Sometimes, we have to show them how to use their coverage so that they can do the things they want to do.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Navigators_01-resized-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 15:57:41.401831

Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.
These states’ moves and Trump’s massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they’re logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.
But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don’t stray too far from Trump’s law.
“The statute sets both the floor and ceiling” for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.
South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state’s laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state’s Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be “an exercise in futility.”
Arkansas’ plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Arizona’s proposal also includes something that’s not in the federal law: A ban on “able-bodied adults” receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.
Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.
The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
“We don’t exactly know what that will cover,” Hinton said.
It’s unclear how federal officials will respond to the states’ requests, she added, but “we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.”
States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.
The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.
Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona’s Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.
Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona’s plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.
The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.
Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements — called “community engagement” standards under the state plan — in 2019, but the state’s application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.
After Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality “as soon as is practicable.”
The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.
Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn’t know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.
“The state should have a say,” Lammers said. “We’re very independent, and everyone is different.”
In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.
In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina’s proposal “a state-specific solution.”
The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. “Georgia Pathways to Coverage” expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they’re working, not monthly. That’s a pivot away from the program’s initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.
Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia’s Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.
So Georgia is among the states in limbo, awaiting guidance from the federal government.

Later this summer, a fluorescent reddish-pink spiral will bloom across the Wilkinson Basin in the Gulf of Maine, about 40 miles northeast of Cape Cod. Scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will release the nontoxic water tracer dye behind their research vessel, where it will unfurl into a half-mile wide temporary plume, bright enough to catch the attention of passing boats and even satellites.
As it spreads, the researchers will track its movement to monitor a tightly controlled, federally approved experiment testing whether the ocean can be engineered to absorb more carbon, and in turn, help combat the climate crisis.
As the world struggles to stay below the 1.5-degree Celsius global warming threshold—a goal set out in the Paris Agreement to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change—experts agree that reducing greenhouse gas emissions won’t be enough to avoid overshooting this target. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, published in 2023, emphasizes the urgent need to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere, too.
“If we really want to have a shot at mitigating the worst effects of climate change, carbon removal needs to start scaling to the point where it can supplement large-scale emissions reductions,” said Adam Subhas, an associate scientist in marine chemistry and geochemistry at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who will oversee the week-long experiment.
The test is part of the LOC-NESS project—short for Locking away Ocean Carbon in the Northeast Shelf and Slope—which Subhas has been leading since 2023. The ongoing research initiative is evaluating the effectiveness and environmental impact of a marine carbon dioxide removal approach called ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE).
This method of marine carbon dioxide removal involves adding alkaline substances to the ocean to boost its natural ability to neutralize acids produced by greenhouse gases. It’s promising, Subhas said, because it has the potential to lock away carbon permanently.
“Ocean alkalinity enhancement does have the potential to reach sort of gigatons per year of carbon removal, which is the scale at which you would need to supplement emissions reductions,” Subhas said. “Once the alkalinity is dissolved in seawater, it reacts with carbon dioxide and forms bicarbonate—essentially dissolved baking soda. That bicarbonate is one of the most stable forms of carbon in the ocean, and it can stay locked away for tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years.”
But it will be a long time before this could happen at the magnitude needed to mitigate climate change.

According to Wil Burns, co-director of the Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal at American University, between 6 and 10 gigatons of carbon need to be removed from the atmosphere annually by 2050 in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate target. “It’s a titanic task,” he said.
Most marine carbon dioxide removal initiatives, including those involving OAE, are still in a nascent stage.
“We’re really far from having any of these technologies be mature,” said Lisa Levin, an oceanographer and professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, who spoke on a panel at the United Nations Ocean Conference in June about the potential environmental risks of mining and carbon dioxide removal on deep-sea ecosystems.“We’re looking at a decade until any serious, large-scale marine carbon removal is going to be able to happen—or more.”
“In the meantime, everybody acknowledges that what we have to do is to reduce emissions, right, and not rely on taking carbon out of the atmosphere,” she said.
Marine carbon dioxide removal
So far, most carbon removal efforts have centered on land-based strategies, such as planting trees, restoring soils and building machines that capture carbon dioxide directly from the air. Increasingly, researchers are exploring whether the oceans might help.
“Looking at the oceans makes a lot of sense when it comes to carbon removal, because the oceans sequester 70 times more CO2 than terrestrial sources,” Burns said. What if it can hold more?
That question is drawing growing attention, not only from scientists. In recent years, a wave of private companies have started piloting various methods of removing carbon from the oceans.
“It’s really the private sector that’s pushing the scaling of this very quickly,” Subhas said. In the U.S. and Canada, he said, there are at least four companies piloting varied ocean alkalinity enhancement techniques.
Last year, Ebb Carbon, a California-based startup focused on marine carbon dioxide removal, signed a deal with Microsoft to remove up to 350,000 metric tons of CO2 over the next decade using an ocean alkalinity enhancement process that splits seawater into acidic and alkaline streams. The alkaline stream is then returned to the sea where it reacts with CO2 and stores it as bicarbonate, enabling the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In return, Microsoft will purchase carbon removal credits from the startup.

Another company called Vesta, which has headquarters in San Francisco, is using an approach called Coastal Carbon Capture. This involves adding finely ground olivine—a naturally occurring olive-green colored mineral—to sandy beaches. From there, ocean tides and waves carry it into the sea. Olivine reacts quickly with seawater in a process known as enhanced weathering, increasing ocean alkalinity. The company piloted one of their projects in Duck, North Carolina, last year where it estimated approximately 5,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide would be removed through coastal carbon capture after accounting for project emissions, according to its website. 
But these efforts are not without risk, AU’s Burns said. “We have to proceed in an extremely precautionary manner,” he said.
Some scientists are concerned that OAE initiatives that involve olivine, which contains heavy metals like nickel and chromium, may harm marine life, he said. Another concern is that the olivine could cloud certain ocean areas and block light from penetrating to deeper depths. If too much alkalinity is introduced too fast in concentrated areas, he said, some animals might not be able to adjust.
Other marine carbon dioxide removal projects are using other methods besides OAE. Some involve adding iron to the ocean to stimulate growth in microscopic plants called phytoplankton, which absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Others include the cultivation of large-scale farms of kelp and seaweed, which also absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The marine plants can then be sunk in the deep ocean to store the carbon they absorbed.
  In 2023, researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution conducted their first OAE-related field experiment from the 90-foot research vessel R/V Connecticut south of Massachusetts. As part of this first experiment, nontoxic water tracer dye was released into the ocean. Researchers tracked its movement through the water for 72 hours to model the dispersion of a plume of alkalinity over time. Credit: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
One technique that has not yet been tried, but may be piloted in the future, according to the science-based conservation nonprofit Ocean Visions, would employ new technology to accelerate the ocean’s natural process of transferring surface water and carbon to the deep ocean. That’s called artificial downwelling. In a reverse process—artificial upwelling—cooler, nutrient-rich waters from the deep ocean would be pumped to the surface to spur phytoplankton growth.
So far, UC San Diego’s Levin said she is not convinced that these trials will lead to impactful carbon removal.
“I do not think the ocean is ever going to be a really large part of that solution,” she said. However, she added, “It might be part of the storage solution. Right now, people are looking at injecting carbon dioxide that’s removed from industry activities on land and transporting it to the ocean and injecting it into basalt.”
Levin said she’s also worried that we don’t know enough yet about the consequences of altering natural ocean processes.
“I am concerned about how many field trials would be required to actually understand what would happen, and whether we could truly understand the environmental risk of a fully scaled-up operation,” she said.
The experiment
Most marine carbon dioxide removal projects that have kicked off already are significantly larger in scale than the LOC-NESS experiment, which Subhas estimates will remove around 50 tons of CO2.
But, he emphasized, the goal of this project is not to compete in size or scale. He said the aim is to provide independent academic research that can help guide and inform the future of this industry and ensure it does not have negative repercussions on the marine environment.
There is some concern, he said, that commercial entities may pursue large-scale OAE initiatives to capitalize on the growing voluntary carbon market without first conducting adequate testing for safety and efficacy. Unlike those initiatives, there is no profit to be made from LOC-NESS. No carbon credits will be sold, Subhas said.
The project is funded by a collection of government and philanthropic sources including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Carbon to Sea Initiative, a nonprofit that brings funders and scientists together to support marine carbon dioxide removal research and technology.
“We really feel like it’s necessary for the scientific community to be delivering transparent, trusted and rigorous science to evaluate these things as these activities are currently happening and scaling in the ocean by the private sector,” Subhas said.
The LOC-NESS field trial in Wilkinson Basin will be the first “academic only” OAE experiment conducted from a ship in U.S. waters. It is also the first of its kind to receive a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency under the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act.
“There’s no research in the past or planned that gets even close to providing a learning opportunity that this research is providing for OAE in the pelagic environment,” said Carbon to Sea Initiative’s Antonius Gagern, referring to the open sea experiment.
The permit was granted in April after a year of consultations between the EPA and other federal agencies.
During the process’ public comment periods, commenters expressed concerns about the potential impact on marine life, including the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, small crustaceans that they eat called copepods and larvae for the commercially important squid and mackerel fisheries. In a written response to some of these comments, the EPA stated that the small-scale project “demonstrates scientific rigor” and is “not expected to significantly affect human health, the marine environment or other uses of the ocean.”
Subhas and his interdisciplinary team of chemists, biologists, engineers and physicists from Woods Hole have spent the last few years planning this experiment and conducting a series of trials at their lab on Cape Cod to ensure they can safely execute and effectively monitor the results of the open-water test they will conduct this summer in the Gulf of Maine.
They specifically tested the effects of sodium hydroxide—an alkaline substance also known as lye or caustic soda—on marine microbes, phytoplankton and copepods, a crucial food source for many marine species in the region in addition to the right whales. “We chose sodium hydroxide, because it’s incredibly pure,” Subhas said. It’s widely used in the U.S. to reduce acidity in drinking water.
It also helps counter ocean acidification, according to Subhas. “It’s like Tums for the ocean,” he said.
Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs excess carbon dioxide, causing its pH to drop. This makes it harder for corals, krill and shellfish like oysters and clams to develop their hard calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.
This month, the team plans to release 50 tons of sodium hydroxide into a designated area of the Wilkinson Basin from the back of one of two research vessels participating in the LOC-NESS operation.
The basin is an ideal test site, according to Subhas, because there is little presence of phytoplankton, zooplankton, commercial fish larvae and endangered species, including some whales, during this season. Still, as a precautionary measure, Woods Hole has contracted a protected species observer to keep a look out for marine species and mitigate potential harm if they are spotted. That person will be on board as the vessel travels to and from the field trial site, including while the team releases the sodium hydroxide into the ocean.
The alkaline substance will be dispersed over four to 12 hours off the back of one of the research vessels, along with the nontoxic fluorescent red water tracer dye called rhodamine. The dye will help track the location and spread of the sodium hydroxide once released into the ocean, and the vessel’s wake will help mix the solution in with the ocean water.
After about an hour, Subhas said, it will form into a “pinkish” patch of water that can be picked up on satellites. “We’re going to be taking pictures from space and looking at how this patch sort of evolves, dilutes and stretches and disperses over time.”
For a week after that, scientists aboard the vessels will take rotating shifts to collect data around the clock. They will deploy drones and analyze over 20 types of samples from the research vessel to monitor how the surrounding waters and marine life respond to the experiment. They’ll track changes in ocean chemistry, nutrient levels, plankton populations and water clarity, while also measuring acidity and dissolved CO2.
In March, the team did a large-scale dry run of the dispersal at an open air testing facility on a naval base in New Jersey. According to Subhas, the trial demonstrated their ability to safely and effectively deliver alkalinity to surface seawater.
“The next step is being able to measure the carbon uptake from seawater—from the atmosphere into seawater,” he said. That is a slower process. He said he expects to have some preliminary results on carbon uptake, as well as environmental impacts, early next year.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OAE-Chris-Murray-lab-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 15:57:41.401831

She is the agency's seventh director.,"Katie Blount, who oversaw the opening of two state history museums in 2017 and helped coordinate a redesign of the state flag in 2020, said Tuesday that she will retire next year as director of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.
Blount joined the department in 1994 as public relations coordinator. She worked as assistant to the director and deputy director for communication before being named director in 2015. She is the second woman to hold the job. Charlotte Capers led the department from 1955 to 1969.
“Embracing complex stories draws audiences and earns the trust of partners in a position to pour resources into Mississippi,” Blount said in a press release.
She said she will retire June 30, the end of the current state budget year. Blount said the department’s employees deserve credit for telling the state’s story and preserving history.
In recent years, the department has repatriated ancestral remains and burial objects to Native American tribes. It also has worked on projects including stabilization of the Windsor Ruins and revitalization of the Grand Village of the Natchez Indians, both in southwestern Mississippi, and development of a new Vicksburg Civil War Visitor Center set to open in 2028.

Mug shots of Freedom Riders are displayed on the halls of one of the galleries inside of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.
The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History are under one roof in downtown Jackson and are collectively called the Two Mississippi Museums. They opened during the state’s bicentennial celebration.
After legislators voted in 2020 to replace a Confederate-themed state flag that had been used since 1894, Blount joined Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and then-House Speaker Philip Gunn in a ceremony to retire the old flag to the museums.
A commission to design a new flag met that summer at the two museums, choosing a magnolia surrounded by stars and the phrase, “In God We Trust.” The design went on the November 2020 ballot, and voters overwhelmingly ratified the choice.

Reuben Anderson, a former Mississippi Supreme Court justice who chaired the flag commission and is a past president of the Department of Archives and History Board of Trustees, said in a statement to Mississippi Today on Tuesday that his message to Blount is: “Just a Big Thank You for all you have done for the Museum the City of Jackson and Mississippi.”
In June, Blount received a lifetime achievement award from the American Association for State and Local History.
Spence Flatgard, current president of the Archives and History board, praised Blount’s work.
“Katie is universally respected by her peers and state leaders,” Flatgard said in the department’s press release. “Her love for public service and for Mississippians has helped us tell our story to schoolchildren and to presidents.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06214352/IMG_0079.jpg,,,2025-08-12 15:57:41.401831

The post Sen. Eric Barlow will run for Wyoming governor appeared first on WyoFile .","Sen. Eric Barlow will run for Wyoming governor in 2026, the Gillette Republican and former Speaker of the House announced Tuesday. 
“I ask for your support as we embark on this vital journey for our state’s future,” Barlow said at a campaign event in Wright, according to a press release.
Barlow is the biggest name to officially announce a run for governor. Without an incumbent in the race, several other notable Wyoming politicians have either expressed an interest in running or are rumored to be mulling the possibility. They include U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, who sought the job in 2018, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Senate President Bo Biteman and Speaker of the House Chip Neiman. All are Republicans.
Current Gov. Mark Gordon is technically prevented from seeking a third-term in office, though he could challenge that, as the Wyoming Supreme Court has ruled that term limits on the other top elected positions in the state were unconstitutional.
Barlow is not the first candidate to announce — former gubernatorial candidate Brent Bien announced last year and political newcomer Joseph Kibler announced in April. 
Born in Gillette and raised on the family ranch southwest of town, Barlow served as a U.S. Marine and worked as a large-animal veterinarian and a rancher before getting elected to House District 3 in 2013. 
As a lawmaker, Barlow led the House as speaker in 2021 and 2022 and now chairs the Senate Labor, Health and Social Services Committee as well as the Mental Health and Vulnerable Adult Task Force.  
“I am a leader who stands firmly on sound, conservative principles and who will fiercely defend your rights, including the Second Amendment and the sanctity of life,” Barlow said in his announcement. “I will protect your private property rights, safeguard our public lands, and keep Washington, D.C. out of Wyoming’s business.”

His office has estimated that counties need more than 9,000 people to fully staff the state’s polling sites and county election offices for each election. The agency said retired Nebraskans have historically made up the largest portion of the state’s poll workers, but Evnen is urging young Nebraskans to join them. 
“We could not conduct our elections smoothly and independently without the work of thousands of Nebraskans who step up and serve their communities as poll workers,” Evnen said. 
Nationally, 772,000 Americans served as poll workers in the 2024 presidential election, according to the 2024 Election Administration and Voting Survey Report. That’s down from what’s typically been 1 million.

The effort is recognition of National Poll Worker Recruitment Day, when the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency that works with state and local election officials to improve the voting process, kicks off a national effort to encourage more people to volunteer at their local county clerk’s office and sign up to be election workers ahead of the November general election. 
The effort was established in 2020, during a pandemic that left many retirees at home. 
Poll workers are paid both for their training and service on Election Day. Poll workers must be at least 16 years of age and, if 18 or older, registered to vote in their county. 
Nebraska has a unique backup plan for addressing the shortage of election workers — a draft.  Douglas County primarily uses the process, and it works a lot like jury duty.
The next statewide elections in Nebraska are in 2026, where the state will likely be in the national spotlight. Evnen said the state is “continually recognized as a leader in election procedures and security, and that is due in large part to our county election officials and their poll workers.” 
Evnen is running for re-election in 2026 and is trying to balance defending the state’s elections his office administers and echoing the concerns of some Republicans and President Donald Trump over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election, which former President Joe Biden won.

Bailey was hoping the state’s highest court would block a temporary injunction issued by Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang on July 3 that allowed surgical abortions to resume in Missouri. 
Zhang’s injunction pointed to the constitutional amendment approved by Missouri voters last year enshrining the right to an abortion in the state constitution. The attorney general contends Zhang abused her discretion in issuing the injunction. 
In a 7-0 ruling Tuesday, the Supreme Court said Bailey should not have skipped the court of appeals in his quest to overturn Zhang’s order. 
“​​For this reason, this court transfers the case to the court of appeals, where appellate jurisdiction properly lies,” wrote Judge Mary Russell.
The current fight over abortion rights has been a state question since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision. The decision triggered a law that banned all abortions in the state except in cases of medical emergency that endangered a woman’s life.
In response, voters last year approved Amendment 3, legalizing abortion up until the point of fetal viability. But because the amendment did not directly repeal state laws banning or regulating abortion, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, based in Kansas City, and Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, based in St. Louis, sued to block enforcement of those laws.
Zhang has not yet ruled on the lawsuit, but did issue the temporary injunction preventing the state from enforcing numerous regulations, including a 72-hour waiting period and special licensing laws applying only to abortion facilities.

However, President Donald Trump’s administration has since canceled its support for the program amid an effort to clawback $7 billion in solar energy funds, a move the head of the state’s environmental agency says is regrettable. 
With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminating the federal Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which included Solar For All funding, Environmental Protection Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a Thursday social media post that the agency no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program, nor the funds to keep it alive. As a result, state leaders who were promised funds have been left in confusion. 
EGLE Director Phil Roos said in a statement Tuesday that the state’s MI Solar for All Program would provide an average savings of $400 per family per year while creating approximately 700 high-quality local jobs, all while increasing Michigan’s energy independence and building resilience against power outages and extreme weather events.
“Regrettably, the EPA wants to retroactively cut funding for this vital program at a time when such initiatives should be prioritized. We are currently working with Michigan’s Attorney General to determine our next steps,” Roos said in the statement.
According to EGLE, the state was obligated $156.1 million in federal funds to provide direct investments into rooftop solar, community solar, energy storage and upgrades, as well as workforce development, community education and outreach and technical assistance.
The state agency has also announced $13.9 million in awards to 13 pilot projects across the state, including projects in Berrien, Chippewa, Delta, Kent, Oakland, Ottawa, Washtenaw, Wayne and Wexford counties. The future of those programs is uncertain in the wake of the federal grant withdrawal.

An estimated 15 live within the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula.  (Photo credit John Froschauer)Two members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation introduced a bipartisan resolution on Monday to back red wolf repopulation and recovery efforts.
Filed by Democratic Congresswoman Valerie Foushee (NC-04) and Republican Congressman Greg Murphy (NC-03), the resolution asks for continued support and approval of federal programs and initiatives, such as wildlife corridors, to aid in protecting North Carolina’s native red wolf population.
North Carolina is home to the only wild population of red wolves in the world. An estimated 15 live within the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula.
The species has declined by more than 85% in the 2010s from roughly 130 to 15 wolves, according to the North Carolina Wildlife Federation.
“It is imperative that we ensure that red wolves do not go extinct,” Foushee (NC-04) said in a statement.
Red wolves once roamed throughout the eastern seaboard, spanning from New York to Florida, and as far west as Texas, the resolution read.
Threats to the survival of red wolves include habitat loss, collisions with vehicles, gunshot mortality, and hybridization with coyotes, according to the Wildlife Federation.
“With the only wild population of red wolves being located in Eastern North Carolina, it’s vital that we recognize the preservation efforts,” said Murphy.
There are around 270 captive red wolves around the country at zoological parks and repopulation programs, according to the resolution.
In 1967, the red wolf was classified as “threatened with extinction” under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966.
Recovery efforts began after this. The Red Wolf Recovery Program was established in 1973, leading to the first-ever reintroduction of a carnivorous species declared extinct in the wild in 1987, according to the resolution.
The Red Wolf Recovery Program is the lone federal effort dedicated to restoring the species’ wild population.
The program confirmed four wild litters of red wolf pups were born recently on the Albemarle Peninsula, Defenders of Wildlife announced on Friday.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RedWolf-Photo-credit-John-Froschauer.jpg,,,2025-08-12 14:58:09.633806

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)A provision of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act that caps the federal tax deduction for gambling losses at 90% will be costly for gamblers and the Nevada economy, but a potential boon to the illegal betting industry, say experts who joined U.S. Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) Monday in Las Vegas to discuss her effort to restore the full deduction.
Under current law, gamblers can deduct up to 100% of their losses against their winnings. But under the new law, even a gambler who breaks even would end up with a tax liability. 
A bettor who wins $100,000 in a year and then loses it would owe taxes on $10,000. 
The town hall coincided with the opening of Bet Bash, an annual gathering of gamblers at Circa in downtown Las Vegas, just blocks from the panel at Las Vegas City Hall. 
“I’m a 28-year old from New Jersey. I wagered $10 million myself last year with a 4% edge,” an unidentified man told the panel, adding that under the new law he’d be “paying taxes on a million dollars despite winning $400,000.” 
In a 37% tax bracket, the levy amounts to $370,000, resulting in a net profit for the year of $30,000. 
The cap applies to recreational and professional gamblers, who report their winnings and losses as business income and expenses on Schedule C, according to tax experts. Pros can also deduct business expenses such as travel and tournament entry fees 
“If you’re professional, you get self-employment tax on top of that,” said Russell Fox, a local tax professional and member of the panel.

Dina Titus, Adam Robinson of American Bettors’ Voice, former Nevada Gaming Control Board chairwoman Becky Harris, local tax professional Russell Fox, and Nevada Resort Association President and CEO Virginia Valentine warn about fallout from gambling tax provisions in the OBBB passed by conressional Republicans and signed into law by President Donald Trump.

The new law is expected to cut into gambling action across the board, but is especially problematic for professionals, according to Adam Robinson of American Bettors’ Voice, an organization representing the interests of domestic gamblers. 
“If you’re pulling anywhere from 3% to 8% a year on the total amount of money you’ve wagered, in terms of the professional profitability bell curve, you’re probably in pretty good shape,” Robinson said, adding that under Trump’s tax provision, “if you’re not beating the market by 11% or more, it doesn’t make financial sense.” 
The hold (the amount of money a betting operation retains from wagers) in Nevada sports books is currently, on average, about 5% to 6%, up from lower percentages in previous years.  
DraftKings, which enjoyed record revenue in the second quarter of this year, announced its hold for the quarter “exceeded 11.5%,” up from 9.5% in the first quarter. 
The site is known, as are casino sports books, to limit the play of some savvy bettors. 
DraftKings did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In a recent interview, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said the cap on gambling deductions “doesn’t make sense. If you can’t deduct all your losses, you know, how does that make sense that you pay income tax on something that’s not actually income.”
“It’s not just an accounting quirk,” said Robinson with American Bettors’ Voice. “It’s a policy with massive unintended consequences.” Among them, he says, is damage to Nevada’s economy.
“High Volume VIP play and professional play is the backbone of casino handle in sports betting liquidity. If it’s no longer financially viable to bet recreationally or professionally, those players are going to take their action elsewhere,” Robinson said. “That means fewer trips, fewer hotel nights, fewer restaurant visits, fewer tips, fewer jobs.”
Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican who endorsed and was endorsed by Trump, did not respond when asked if he’s reached out to the president about the policy’s impact to the state’s economy. 
The policy will also undercut the gambling tax base developing in other states, Robinson asserts. “I’m from Illinois. I can tell you emphatically that they’re leaning on gaming for tax revenue. If the big players leave, state revenues will drop across the board.”
Lawmakers will respond, he says, by raising taxes on operators, who will “respond with worse odds, higher fees, fewer promotions.” 
Players, he says “aren’t dumb. They understand the tax implications of what’s happening here, and they know if they’ll be taxed unfairly at regulated books, they’ll just move their action to offshore sites, or they’ll go back to their local book, or they’ll look to emerging prediction markets.”
The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) projects the measure will raise roughly $1.1 billion over ten years.
“I don’t think you can raise $1 billion, because if you make people pay taxes on fake money, they’re not going to deduct it or report it or even gamble here,” Titus suggested. “They’ll go offshore or to the black market.” 
Titus is sponsoring the FAIR BET (Fair Accounting for Income Realized from Betting Earnings Taxation) Act, to restore the full deduction. “It’s not partisan. We’ve got some Republicans who are co-sponsors. It’s not ideological. It’s just not fair tax policy.” 
GOP, Dems agree Las Vegas is the perfect place to discuss ‘big’ bill, but for very different reasons

Titus noted that Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, while at a field hearing in Las Vegas last month, admitted the policy “needed to be fixed. It’s kind of like the arsonist saying, ‘let me help you put the fire out.’” 
Tourism and hospitality generate more than a third of Nevada’s gross domestic product, account for 28% of the state’s employment, and 22% of wages earned.
Titus noted gambling is in every state with the exceptions of Hawaii and Utah. “But members of Congress don’t really understand all the complications of gaming, because it’s not as big a deal in their district as it is here.” 
Ripple effect
The cap on the gambling loss deduction, scheduled to go into effect next year, comes as Americans face increased costs from tariffs, cuts to federal food, energy, and education assistance, and the elimination of coverage for millions who receive Medicaid, Titus noted.  
“It’s a perfect storm, and Nevada is always kind of the canary in the coal mine,” she said. “The economy is hit hardest here, and it takes us longer to recover. People have to have a little money in their pocket to go on holiday, and if they’re hurting around the country, we’re going to feel it.”
Visitation to Southern Nevada was off 11.3% in June compared with last year, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. 
“We’re the only state that I’m aware of that can actually lay claim to the fact that the gambling industry is our main industry driver,” former Nevada Gaming Control Board chairwoman Becky Harris said, adding she’s “frankly surprised that gambling caught the attention of somebody to have them want to mess with the tax policy.” 
Nevada Resort Association President and CEO Virginia Valentine noted that how the new law will affect player behavior remains to be seen, but warned even the perception of a lack of fairness “is probably enough” to turn off some customers. 
“The proposition when you walk into the casino is that you’re going to play your money, the game’s going to be fair, and at the end of the day, you’re going to be taxed fairly,” she said.
Harris observed that even stock market losses are deductible. She wondered what’s next from the feds. 
“What is the federal government going to come in and fiddle with next that’s going to be to everybody’s disadvantage?” she asked. “Why are you inserting yourself into my jurisdiction? Why are you trying to dictate policy?”
Harris noted that Nevada sports books were once “almost taxed out of existence” by the federal government.
In 1951, two decades after Nevada legalized gambling, the feds imposed a 10% tax on sportsbooks in response to opposition. The effort put some books out of business and drove others underground. The tax came down to 4% in 1974. Today, sports books pay a federal excise tax of 0.25% on each wager.  
“I remember a quote from the late Paul Volker, who was a chair of the Federal Reserve,” said Fox, the tax accountant. ‘Whatever you tax, you get less of.’”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-632829324-1024x623.jpg,,,2025-08-12 14:58:09.633806
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-12 18:05:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,Tommy Duff tries to stake out ‘outsider’ identity in first political speech,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/12/tommy-duff-tries-to-stake-out-outsider-identity-in-first-political-speech/,"Billionaire Duff, in speech to Rankin County Republicans, stopped short again of announcing a run for Mississippi 
Governor.","It took Tommy Duff precisely 20 seconds to invoke the outsider businessman who rose to power with no experience holding elected office. Duff would have mentioned President Donald Trump even sooner had he not paused a few seconds to wait for applause to hush. 
Trump, Duff exclaimed before a room full of Republican insiders at a hotel in Rankin County on Monday night, has surpassed his 200th day in office. He said the changes Trump has brought about are self-evident, and the impact of the administration’s agenda is as direct as the president at its helm. He said Trump is someone who says “this is what we’re doing, and then does it.”
“And I think the thing that appeals to me the most about President Trump and watching his policies is the fact that he’s an outsider,” Duff added. “He looks at things in a different perspective. He thinks that if we’ve operated this way for so long, why don’t we change? Because maybe what we’ve been doing has not been working.” 
In what Duff’s advisers characterized as the first political speech of his life, the billionaire tire baron on Monday outlined some of the challenges he believes Mississippi must tackle, and the “vision” he has for doing so. That vision was largely short on policy specifics. 
In a sit-down interview with Mississippi Today in June, at an event with business leaders in July, and at a “Lincoln-Reagan-Trump” dinner on Monday, Duff has hinted at the broad outlines of what could become a gubernatorial campaign agenda. But Duff has largely done so without offering specific policy proposals, citing the nearly 27 months remaining until Election Day in 2027. 
Duff, Mississippi’s richest man, again stopped short of formally announcing a run for governor in 2027, but he has said publicly he is considering entering the race. 
His speech on Monday was not a divergence from his recent public appearances, as he remarks did not shed light on where he stands on a wide range of ongoing public policy debates in Mississippi, including the intra-party Republican fights on school choice and Medicaid expansion.
But he expanded on his prior calls for Mississippi to get serious about fixing its brain drain problem. Mississippi has seen a large share of its college graduates flee to other states in search of, among other priorities, lucrative jobs. 
Keeping more Mississippi-educated college students and offering the job opportunities that may incentivize them to stay, along with improving the state’s labor force participation rate, will set the stage for what Duff sees as the state’s central challenge: overtaking other southeastern states in the race for economic investment. That should involve increasing economic activity in Mississippi in areas of the state that are losing population, such as the Delta, Duff said. 
“We’re doing great in education. I am so proud of our educational advances and what we’re doing, and I give great tribute to the leaders of Mississippi for that,” Duff said. “We are doing great as a state as far as our economic activity, but there are pockets of our state that are just desperate for assistance, desperate. How can we continue to grow our state?” 
Education and economic development were the dominant themes in a speech that ran just under 30 minutes. 
Duff, who with his brother is reportedly worth a combined $7 billion, said he supported the Legislature’s “reduction” of the state income tax. In 2025, Mississippi’s Republican majority passed legislation that will gradually eliminate the tax over several years. 
But Duff also used the occasion to draw historical parallels that could prove helpful later. By the second minute of his remarks, he had mentioned not only Trump, but Kirk Fordice, who entered Mississippi’s 1992 gubernatorial race as a businessman and political outsider. Fordice rode that political image to the governor’s mansion, becoming the first Republican governor in Mississippi since Reconstruction.
For Fordice and other Republicans, Rankin County has been a key GOP stronghold. 
Duff spoke in Flowood at the Sheraton’s The Refuge, the same hotel where incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves celebrated his reelection in 2023. 
The event, which organizers said was sold out, charged $100 for individual tickets. Tables cost $1,000, with the priciest tier landing at $10,000 for access to a VIP sponsor reception and two VIP tables. State legislators mingled with local party officials and lobbyists inside a cavernous ballroom, outside which a bar overlooked the hotel golf course. 
Duff’s political action committee promoted fundraising for the event, with proceeds going to the Rankin County Republican Executive Committee. 
Duff keynoted a speaking program that included at least one of his potential rivals for the governor’s mansion: Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson.
Gipson, 48, a former state lawmaker, lawyer, and Baptist minister, has already thrown his cowboy hat in the ring for the governor’s race. Gipson, who has served in state government for 17 years, delivered the invocation on Monday, informing the crowd that a higher power had made clear Mississippi’s biggest problem had nothing to do with public policy. 
“You saw our greatest problem was not education. Our greatest problem was not financing. Our greatest problem was not health care. Our problem was sin,” Gipson said.  
The speakers also included Secretary of State Michael Watson, seen as a likely candidate for lieutenant governor in 2027. Watson introduced Duff, highlighting his business success as an exemplar of both the American Dream and a Republican Party that venerates individualism. 
“He could clock out, but he hasn’t because he cares. And I think that’s an important piece of being an elected official, not that he is one, but just in case,” Watson said. “We believe it’s good to celebrate freedom, rugged individualism, hard work, entrepreneurship and success. We celebrate the positive things happening in Mississippi and America right now, and we celebrate that the American Dream is alive and well.” 
When Duff took the stage, he cast the story behind his business empire in a less individualistic light, pointing out that he had help along the way. 
“I went about a year without a paycheck. But luckily, I lived at home, and mom and dad took care of it. But we worked and we had fun, and as we grew, I learned a lot of things. One is that I’m not that important. The culture and the people are what’s important.” 
With respect to the current culture war, Duff’s remarks were short on red meat, though Duff did mention an episode from years ago when he and his brother Jim were asked by a Forbes Magazine reporter whether they had a DEI policy (the answer was no). 
Duff also mentioned his eight-year stint on the state Institutions of Higher Learning Board, claiming to have helped improve the financial health of the state’s higher education system. Duff has also done that through private donations – he and his brother have donated about $50 million to Mississippi universities.
Duff’s remarks also drew from a conversation he reported having with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. The men each spoke at a July 28 summit hosted by Mississippi Today and Deep South Today. 
Duff said Dimon asked him why only just over half of Mississippi adults eligible to work are working, as shown by a labor-force participation rate that lags most other states. Duff, who through his companies employs thousands of Mississippi residents, said the answer is a lack of well-paying jobs.
That sentiment seemed to be shared by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who, in another private conversation with Duff, reportedly nudged him to bring more of his company’s jobs to the state. 
“She said, let’s talk about how you’re going to have more (employees). Let’s talk about what other businesses you can put in our state. And I stopped, and I said, this lady really learned from Donald Trump,” Duff said. “She really understands things, because she approaches it in a different manner.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05145514/3X0A0670-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-12 14:58:09.633806

DemasMembers of one of the state’s foremost environmental advocacy groups are taking the state’s largest electrical utilities to task for more than $250,000 in political contributions made over the past six months. 
In a statement last week, the Michigan League of Conservation voters called out Consumers Energy and DTE Energy for political contributions to more than half of members in the Legislature, particularly members sitting on energy policy committees. 
“While Michigan families continue to pay the highest rates in the Midwest for the worst service, DTE and Consumers are writing check after check to lawmakers helping their CEOs protect this broken status quo,” Bob Allison, deputy director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters said in a statement. “Michiganders of all political stripes chafe at our elected leaders being so blatantly influenced by the very utilities they, by law, are responsible for overseeing on behalf of us.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The issue of political contributions is a bipartisan one, the league said, with DTE cutting $10,000 checks to the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate in both the first and second quarter of the year. The company also made political contributions to individual lawmakers. Consumers Energy followed a similar strategy, with both caucuses and several lawmakers receiving thousands in campaign contributions, the league said. 
According to the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group and energy watchdog, the two companies serve more than 80% of electricity customers in the state, while Michigan ranks among the worst in the nation for energy reliability and affordability.
Additionally, the League notes that the most recent round of donations is only what is publicly reported, pointing to an article from Bridge Michigan which noted that a “dark money” nonprofit linked to Consumers Energy spent more than $4.5 million on campaign donations in 2022 while a nonprofit linked to DTE spent $4.9 million. 
In a statement to the Michigan Advance, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry said the company is in compliance with all applicable laws regarding corporate donations and political contributions. 
“These disclosures showcase DTE’s commitment to our customers and communities we serve, helping us meet our aspiration of being best in the world and best for the world. The political contributions the company makes are supported by the DTE voluntary employee PAC or DTE shareholders – not from customer revenue,” Lowry said.
Consumers Energy Spokesperson Brian Wheeler similarly noted that its political contributions either originate from investor funds, or voluntary contributions employees make to their CMS Energy Employees for Better Government Political Action Committee – never customer dollars.
“[The PAC], is nonprofit, nonpartisan, and governed by an employee-run steering committee that is independent of the Corporation’s officers and Board. Participation in the PAC is voluntary and gives employees a voice in the political process, and all PAC contributions are publicly disclosed on the Secretary of State’s website,” Wheeler said.
The Michigan League of Conservation Voters is one of a host of organizations challenging lawmakers to forgo donations from Michigan’s energy utilities, with 24 members of the Legislature signing on. 
The coalition is also backing a ballot initiative to ban regulated utility companies and companies seeking government contracts from making political contributions.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_1696-2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-12 14:58:09.633806

(Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)North Idaho health officials on Tuesday identified the state’s first confirmed measles infection in a resident since 2023. The case was reported amid the nation’s worst outbreak of the disease in decades. 
The Panhandle Health District reported the case was an unvaccinated child in Kootenai County; the confirmation of the infection marked the first case in the state’s Panhandle area since 1991, according to a press release from the health district. 
Health officials last week reported that the measles virus was detected in wastewater in Coeur d’Alene, indicating someone in the area was infected, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Measles is a highly contagious virus and spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, the Panhandle Health District press release said. The virus can stay in the air two hours after an infected person has left. Symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash. 
Traveler visiting eastern Idaho had measles. But officials don’t think the public was exposed.

While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.
Cases of the disease nationwide reported in 2025 have already surpassed the total number of cases in 2024, the release said. Measles has been reported in 41 jurisdictions, including in Washington, Montana, Oregon and Wyoming. Among those cases, 13% have been hospitalized, most of them children, the release said. 
State health officials also previously reported that a child from another country visiting eastern Idaho had measles, the Sun reported. 
Health officials encourage people to verify their family’s vaccination records with their primary care provider or through the Docket App. A person is considered immune if they were born before Jan. 1, 1957, have a documented history of laboratory-confirmed measles or have documentation that they received both doses of the MMR vaccine. 
“The measles vaccine is highly effective, and for most people, two childhood doses of vaccine is all they will ever need to protect themselves against measles for their lifetime,” the release said. The MMR vaccine is typically given between 12 and 15 months of age followed by another dose at 4 to 6 years of age. It can be given as early as 6 months of age for those who are traveling to areas with known measles infections or in the event of a local outbreak of measles, the release said.
 What to do if you’re exposed to measles

The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death. A high fever, cough, runny nose, rash and red, watery eyes are common measles symptoms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, says. 
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.

As of this month, 12 states, mostly Republican and in the South, have opted to limit SNAP recipients from purchasing foods such as soda and candy. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

The incident unfolded around 11:15 a.m. Mike Tejpal said he was outside when he saw a Dodge Charger, Nissan Maxima and Ford Explorer pull up to the entrance. Men dressed in military-style vests got out and moved swiftly through the glass doors at the front of the building, he said. Most were wearing masks and dark baseball caps, he said.
“It was like a storming of the courthouse,” said Tejpal, who is part of a local group that documents immigration arrests in the vicinity of the building.
Criminal defense lawyer Francisco Cardona said he was inside the court clerk’s office when he heard a commotion. Cardona said he turned and saw five or six officers running toward a bathroom.
“I thought it was just somebody trying to fight in the courthouse, but as soon as we stepped outside it was clear to everyone that it was ICE agents,” he said.
Cardona said the officers pushed against the bathroom door, which was obstructed from the other side. Connecticut judicial marshals, who provide security for the building, then cleared lawyers and members of the public from the area, he said.
Cardona said he saw federal officers leave a few minutes later, taking two men in custody with them. He said one of the opaque panels on the bathroom door was broken, and he could smell an odor that resembled pepper spray.
“It was quite the scene,” Cardona said. “It’s just like you see in the movies.”
Watching from outside, Tejpal said one of the detained men was crying and spitting as he emerged in handcuffs. Video he captured shows officers walking the men out of the building and loading them into vehicles.
Tejpal said about five to seven minutes transpired between when the officers arrived and left.
Representatives of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to an email seeking comment about the arrests.
Rhonda Hebert, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Judicial Branch, responded to questions about the incident with a written statement. In it, she referred to restrictions put in place by the Trust Act, a state law that limits cooperation between state and local law enforcement and ICE.
“The Judicial Branch adheres to the Trust Act,” Hebert said. “Under the act, we are not to prevent or assist ICE in the apprehension of individuals in the courthouse.”
Members of local advocacy groups say they have observed federal immigration officers operating around the Stamford court since at least early July.
Arrest data shows migrants in the state with pending criminal charges have increasingly been a focus for local ICE officers.
However, in Stamford, arrests were previously thought to have occurred only outside the court building, said David Michel, a former Connecticut state representative who regularly documents immigration arrests in the area.
Michel, who is part of a coalition called Stamford Norwalk United with Immigrants, said lawmakers and the governor should strengthen protections for migrants in Connecticut.
“It feels like we’re in a state of lawlessness,” Michel said. “When I document this, I feel like I’m in another country.”

As of this month, 12 states, mostly Republican and in the South, have opted to limit SNAP recipients from purchasing foods such as soda and candy. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends, and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.

The Delaware Court of Chancery will introduce a new automated case assignment system, known as “wheelspin,” on September 15, 2025. 
The changes, part of a broader upgrade to the court’s electronic filing system, are designed to streamline case management, balance workloads among judges, and remove discretion from the case assignment process.
Among the updates, the court will replace its Supplemental Information Sheet with a graphical user interface featuring drop-down menus. The goal is to generate more uniform, accurate, and accessible data to help the court monitor case trends.
“We also hope that the electronic format will make new filings easier for filers,” said Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick.
 The updates also bring a new, narrower definition of “related cases”: “cases are related if they arise from the same factual predicate or transaction and involve overlapping companies or parties.” This change means that a case will not automatically be assigned to a judge who previously handled litigation involving a defendant corporation unless the new matter stems from the “same factual predicate or transaction.”
RELATED STORY: Gene Truono named Delaware Republican Party Chair
Categories previously handled by Magistrate Judges, such as books and records and advancement actions, will remain with them. A Standing Order also allows certain contract disputes to be sent to Superior Court Judges in the Complex Commercial Litigation Division.
“The current assignment system resulted from a collaborative pilot program spearheaded by Vice Chancellor Morgan T. Zurn. I am grateful for her leadership on this matter,” said Chancellor McCormick.
The procedural overhaul has been welcomed by Citizens for Judicial Fairness, which has long pushed for randomized case assignments in the Court of Chancery.
Delaware Speaker of the House Rep. Melissa Minor-Brown, who has supported the shift to automated assignments, added: 
“Fairness and justice are the guiding principles of our judicial system, but we can’t fully uphold them by standing still. We have to continually look at how innovation and improved systems can move us forward. Bringing wheelspin, or automated randomized case assignments, to our courts will improve their operations and ensure they remain a beacon of fairness.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tingey-injury-law-firm-veNb0DDegzE-unsplash-2-scaled-e1755017349629-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-08-12 13:56:47.534661

Kim Reynolds announced Aug. 12, 2025. Guard members are shown here marching in a parade at the Iowa State Fair. (Photo courtesy of Iowa National Guard)Iowa National Guard soldiers will deploy to provide support for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in September, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Tuesday.
The deployment, set to begin Sept. 8, will involve 20 National Guard soldiers providing “administrative and logistical support” to ICE officials based in Iowa who are enforcing immigration laws, according to the news release. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has authorized the National Guard action as a supportive federal Title 32 mission, meaning the soldiers will be on active duty under state control but with federal pay.
Reynolds said the announcement comes in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to provide assistance to ICE as the agency carries out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts. The New York Times reported in July National Guard deployments are planned in 20 states with GOP governors, including Florida, Tennessee and Virginia.
Iowa is one of the states participating in this effort. In a statement, Reynolds linked the announcement to previous Iowa National Guard deployments to the U.S. southern border. The governor has sent state National Guard members to Texas to assist with state immigration enforcement efforts in 2023 and 2024, in addition to sending Iowa Department of Public Safety officers and Iowa State Patrol troopers to assist with missions in previous years.
“Just as we supported Texas when the Biden Administration left them to defend the border, Iowa will continue to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws — this time, by working with the Trump Administration to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in our state,” Reynolds said in a statement. “By providing administrative and logistical support, the Iowa National Guard will free up local ICE officials to continue their work outside the office to enforce the law and keep our state safe.”
The governor has repeatedly emphasized her commitment to working with the Trump administration and ICE in the national immigration crackdown. But some immigrant rights advocates say these actions will hurt Iowa’s immigrant communities.
Alejandra Escobar with the organization Escucha Mi Voz Iowa said in a statement earlier in August the decision to use the Iowa National Guard in ICE efforts “represents an unprecedented escalation in anti-immigrant policy” that could result in civil liberties violations and risk the safety of Iowa families.
“Escucha Mi Voz members demand Governor Reynolds keep the Iowa National Guard out of immigration enforcement,” Escobar said. “Deploying the National Guard against our state’s hard working immigrant communities is morally indefensible and risks widespread violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights. We will be closely monitoring this situation and are prepared to mobilize communities statewide against any action that threatens Iowa families.”
The state government has also taken other actions to be involved in federal immigration law enforcement. The Iowa Department of Public Safety signed an agreement with ICE in March to establish a three-person task force of special agents, deputized to carry out certain federal immigration law enforcement actions, like issuing immigration detainers.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird also pursued a lawsuit against Winneshiek County and its sheriff, Dan Marx, after he made a Facebook post saying he would not honor ICE detainer quests for people suspected of being undocumented immigrants, if requests had not been approved by the courts. The lawsuit was dismissed in July, as Bird said Marx and the county “have committed to continue to honor ICE detainers and cooperate with federal immigration authorities.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iowa-national-guard-e1738277998553.jpeg,,,2025-08-12 13:56:47.534661

Sessions are designed to engage Nebraskans, particularly members of Black, Native American, Latino, immigrant and rural communities who disproportionately face barriers in accessing legal support and in navigating the justice system, the coalition said in a statement.
Organizers hope to spark community conversations about challenges and gather feedback to develop solutions. In addition to sharing concerns and service gaps, community education will be provided on basic legal issues.
A’Jamal Byndon, chair of Movement in Omaha for Racial Equity (MORE), a key coalition partner, said the “Justice Access Engagement Sessions” are a critical step to expanding access and eliminating justice deserts.
“Your voice matters, and it is essential to building a more equitable legal system for everyone,” he said.
Food will be served at the sessions that are free and open to the public. Registration is requested online or by phone, at 402-212-7083. 
Similar sessions will be scheduled this fall in Scottsbluff and Lincoln. 
In addition to MORE, the coalition includes the Omaha and Lincoln chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Nebraska Appleseed, ACLU of Nebraska, Legal Aid of Nebraska, the Nebraska State Bar Association, Legal Aid of Nebraska and local private attorneys.

Kennedy Jr. has upended COVID vaccine approvals and recommendations, creating uncertainty where coverage was routine.","If you want a covid-19 shot this fall, will your employer’s health insurance plan pay for it? There’s no clear answer. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has upended the way covid vaccines are approved and for whom they’re recommended, creating uncertainty where coverage was routine.Agencies within HHS responsible for spelling out who should get vaccinated aren’t necessarily in sync, issuing seemingly contradictory recommendations based on age or risk factors for serious disease.But the ambiguity may not affect your coverage, at least this year.“I think in 2025 it’s highly likely that the employer plans will cover” the covid vaccines, said Jeff Levin-Scherz, a primary care doctor who is the population health leader for the management consultancy WTW and an assistant professor at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. They’ve already budgeted for it, “and it would be a large administrative effort to try to exclude coverage for those not at increased risk,” he said.With so much in flux, it’s important to check with your employer or insurer about coverage policies before you roll up your sleeve.Here’s what we know so far, and what remains unclear.Q: How have the recommendations changed?What used to be straightforward is now much murkier. Last year, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech covid vaccines were recommended for anyone at least 6 months old.This year, the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is narrower. Although the vaccines are broadly recommended for adults 19 and older, they are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people or for healthy children 6 months through 17 years old.Kennedy announced the changes in a video in May, citing safety risks for young people and pregnant people as justification.But his claims have been widely disputed by experts in vaccines, pediatrics, and women’s health. An analysis by FactCheck.org found that the secretary “misrepresented scientific research to make unfounded claims about vaccine safety for pregnant people and children.”In addition, recently announced changes to the vaccine approval framework have further chipped away at eligibility.Moderna announced July 10 that the FDA had fully approved its Spikevax covid vaccine — but approval is restricted to adults 65 and older, and for people from 6 months through 64 years old who are at increased risk of developing a serious case of covid.Two other covid vaccines expected to be available this fall, Novavax’s Nuvaxovid and Moderna’s mNexspike, are also restricted. They are approved for people 65 or older and those 12 to 64 who have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of developing severe covid.Notably, Pfizer’s Comirnaty covid vaccine is still approved or authorized for people 6 months of age and older without any restrictions based on risk factors for covid — at least for now. But the FDA could change that at any time, experts said.Increasing restrictions “is definitely the direction they are moving,” said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at KFF who authored a KFF analysis of vaccine insurance coverage rules. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.HHS did not provide an on-the-record comment for this article.Q: How might these changes alter my insurance coverage for the vaccine?That’s the big question, and the answer is uncertain. Without insurance coverage, people could owe hundreds of dollars for the shot.Most private health plans are required by law to cover recommended vaccines, whether for covid, measles, or the flu, without charging their members. But that requirement kicks in after the shots are recommended by a federal panel — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — and adopted by the CDC director, according to the KFF analysis. The committee hasn’t yet voted on covid vaccine recommendations for this fall. Its next meeting is expected to occur in August or September.Still, employers and insurers can opt to cover the vaccines on their own, as many did before the law required them to do so. But they may require people to pay something for it.In addition, the narrower recommendations from different HHS agencies might result in some health plans declining to pay for certain categories of people to get certain vaccines, experts said.“I don’t think an employer or insurer would deny coverage,” Kates said. “But they could say: You have to get this product.”That could mean a 45-year-old with no underlying health conditions raising their covid risk might have to get the Pfizer shot rather than the Moderna version if they want their health plan to pay for it, experts said.In addition, up to 200 million people may qualify for the vaccines because they have health conditions such as asthma or diabetes that increase their risk of severe disease, according to a commentary published by FDA officials in the New England Journal of Medicine.Health care professionals can help people determine whether they qualify for the shot based on health conditions.Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, which represents health plans, said in a statement that plans will continue to follow federal requirements for vaccine coverage.Q: What are the options for people who are pregnant or have children they want to have vaccinated?Many parents are confused about getting their kids vaccinated, according to a KFF poll released on Aug. 1. About half said they don’t know whether federal agencies recommend healthy children get the vaccine this fall. Among the other half, more said the vaccine is not recommended than recommended.Meanwhile, Kennedy’s recommendation that healthy children not get vaccinated has a notable caveat: If a parent wishes a child to get a covid vaccine and a health care provider recommends it, the child can receive it under the “shared clinical decision-making” model, and it should be covered without cost sharing.Some policy experts point out that this is the way care for kids is typically provided anyway.“Outside of any requirements, vaccines have always been provided through shared decision-making,” said Amanda Jezek, senior vice president of public policy and government relations at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.There’s no similar allowance for pregnant people. However, even though Kennedy has stated that covid vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people, pregnancy is one of the underlying medical conditions that put people at high risk for getting very sick from covid, according to the CDC. That could make pregnant people eligible for the shot.Depending on the stage of someone’s pregnancy, it could be difficult to know whether someone should be denied the shot based on their condition. “This is uncharted territory,” said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.Q: How will these changes affect access to the vaccine? Will I still be able to go to the pharmacy for the shot?“If far fewer are expected to be vaccinated, fewer sites will offer the vaccinations,” Levin-Scherz said. This could be an especially notable hurdle for people looking for pediatric doses of a covid vaccine, he said.In addition, pharmacists’ authority to administer vaccines depends on several factors. For example, in some states they can administer shots that have been approved by the FDA, while in others the shots must have been recommended by the ACIP, said Hannah Fish, senior director of strategic initiatives at the National Community Pharmacists Association. Since ACIP hasn’t yet recommended covid shots for the fall, that could create a speed bump in some states.“Depending on the rules, you still may be able to get the shot at the pharmacy, but they might have to call the physician to send over a prescription,” Fish said.Q: What do these changes mean long-term?It’s impossible to know. But given Kennedy’s vocal skepticism of vaccines and his embrace of long-disproven theories about connections between vaccines and autism, among other things, medical and public health professionals are concerned those views will shape future policies.“The recommendation changes that were made with respect to children and pregnant women were not necessarily made in good science,” Corlette said.It’s already a challenge to convince people they need annual covid shots, and shifting guidelines may make it tougher, some public health experts warn.“What’s concerning is that this could even further depress the uptake of the covid vaccines,” Jezek said.KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

On July 29, Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jonathan D. Frieden ruled in favor of nine Democratic senators who filed the lawsuit after the appointees continued serving without being confirmed by the General Assembly. Frieden opined that the Senate committee on Privileges and Elections’ rejection of the appointees served as a signal that the legislature wasn’t willing to confirm the new additions to the boards.
The senators consider George Mason University Rector Charles Stimson, University of Virginia Rector Rachel Sheridan, and Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors President James P. Inman, all of whom are named in the suit, as responsible for allowing the rejected appointments to serve on their respective boards.
Miyares said the temporary injunction granted by Reid is causing more problems than it solves for the courts and the institutional leaders.
“A central purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo between the parties while litigation is ongoing,” wrote Miyares. “But the circuit court’s preliminary injunction disrupts the status quo, compelling the Rectors to take the unprecedented step of barring participation by board members who have been serving for months—a step they do not have the legal power to take.”
In his petition, Miyares argues that the circuit court’s injunction is incorrect because the Senators don’t have the right to sue and are targeting the wrong defendants, specifically the university rectors. 
He also stated that the senators did not demonstrate that they would suffer any irreparable harm and are unlikely to succeed on their constitutional claim. He explained that the refusal of the appointees must involve a “completed and final refusal” by both the House and Senate, not just the committee of senators who rejected the appointments. The attorney general added that the senators’ theory that a vote by one committee of one chamber constitutes refusal by the General Assembly is wrong.
Before the appeal was filed, Democrats stated that the court affirmed the Senate’s constitutional authority to confirm or reject board nominees, and that the Senate’s authority cannot be bypassed. Democrats including President Pro Tempore L. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Committee Chair Aaron Rouse, Virginia Beach filed the initial suit. 
In response to Miyares’ petition, Surovell said Tuesday he was puzzled by the AG’s argument that “the General Assembly has been confirming people in the wrong way for the last 100 years” when Miyares served in the House of Delegates for six of those years and “never said anything.”
On Tuesday afternoon, Senate Democrats posted a video on social media reiterating their intent to defend Virginia’s public universities from partisan attacks.
No court date has been set, as the Supreme Court will determine whether to hear the case.

Why are there only a few people growing it?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Dave Altimari to discuss his article, “Made in the shade: CT tobacco farmers roll with the times,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Dave’s story here.
WSHU: You smoke cigars. So it must be fascinating to look behind the scenes into tobacco growing in Connecticut, considering shade tobacco leaves grown in the upper Connecticut River Valley are some of the best in the world. So tell us a little bit about the Connecticut tobacco and the shade tobacco specifically, and what you found when you went to look into this.
DA: So Connecticut shade tobacco has always been known as the best tobacco to wrap a cigar in the world, and I was surprised to learn that it’s basically not really grown here anymore. The only person who grows Connecticut shade tobacco now is a farmer in Southwick, Massachusetts.
WSHU: Wow. Why so? If it’s much sought after, why have the farmers left the business?
DA: Several reasons. First, it is a hard crop to grow. There are six pickings. It’s very susceptible to bugs and bad weather, and it doesn’t like a lot of wet weather. And it’s also, you know, after you pick it, you have to hang it, and you have to let it hang for like two months. So it’s a little tricky to handle. But the real reason was that some of the major cigar companies realized that, for some reason, Ecuador and the Upper Connecticut River Valley have almost the same climate and soil, and that they could move their operations to Ecuador and pay significantly less to get the tobacco.
WSHU: So labor was responsible.
DA: A lot of the major companies now grow what they call Connecticut seed shade tobacco in Ecuador. But it is not the same thing.
WSHU: Okay. Now, what happens with the tobacco leaves? You said it takes a while for them to be dried out, and picking the tobacco is labor-intensive. I was fascinated when I read in your article that people had to crawl on the ground to pick the leaves. Could you just describe that?
DA: Some of the plants are 10- 12 feet high. There were six pickings, and we went to the first one, which was in late July. So they had to literally pick the leaves off the bottom of the plants. So what they do is scoot along the ground, pick the leaves, and put them in a little plastic bin.
WSHU: And this cannot be mechanized. It has to be done by hand.
DA: All by hand. There were about 50 people picking on the day we were there. It was mostly a mix of older Jamaican guys and high school kids. Some of these guys have been doing this for 40 years, and for some of the others, it was their second day on the job. So it’s quite a mix of people. And Dwight Arnold, the farmer who grows it in Southwick. You know, he’s basically there running the show. He knows everybody’s name. He’s moving people between different rows of tobacco. It’s all also underneath this, like a white cloth covering.
WSHU: That’s why it’s called the shade tobacco, because it has a shade.
DA: To keep it from the sun and also to it, it’s very warm. It almost makes it more tropical. It was interesting to see the difference between standing outside and then going underneath the cloth, the shade cloth. It was definitely a little more humid, which is good for the tobacco. So he has about 35 acres now that he’s planting. There used to be well over 1000 acres of shade tobacco planted in Connecticut, not that long ago, in the 80s and maybe the early 90s. Tobacco hasn’t disappeared. A lot of those farmers now grow what they call broadleaf tobacco, and that is used more as tobacco to fill a cigar, not as a wrapper. It’s different, so easier to grow, not as temperament, not as temperamental. And so a lot of farmers have switched to growing what they call Connecticut broadleaf.
WSHU: Now, tell us, what is the difference between the wrapper and the filler? Was that distinction made?
DA: So broadleaf, the leaves, that they pull the whole plant. It’s not just one or two leaves six times. They do it one harvest, pull the whole plant, and hang the whole plant upside down to let it dry. The process of drying is very similar. You still need the sheds and to hang everything from, but it’s much easier to get it to that point. You just pull the whole plant and hang it upside down. It dries quicker. You don’t have to worry about it ripping. You know, the Connecticut shade is only used for a wrapper, so you have to, if you rip it or tear it, it’s no good. The tobacco browns as it hangs. It’s hard to handle. You have to; it’s a delicate thing to handle, and you don’t want to rip it at that point, because now it’s almost ready to be sent to the factory.
WSHU: So if it is ripped, it can’t be used to wrap.
DA: Yeah, you’re not going to wrap a cigar with a ripped wrapper; it won’t work.
WSHU: And the shade tobacco that’s grown here is sent to the Dominican Republic for drying again.
DA: Yes. So what happened is Dwight has a contract with the company that sells Macanudo cigars, and so they basically have told him, We will buy whatever you grow, and we will use it on our high-end Macanudo cigars as Connecticut shade wrapper cigars. So he probably after he picks it, he probably dries it out in his sheds for six weeks to two months, depending on circumstances and weather, and then it gets shipped down to the Dominican, where the Macanudos are made, and it is dried some more. It generally takes roughly a year from when a leaf is picked until somebody wraps a cigar in it.
WSHU: Wow. So what’s the future for the tobacco farmers of Connecticut?
DA: Actually, after my story ran, I got two phone calls from farmers who used to grow Connecticut shade, and they wanted Dwight’s phone number. They missed growing it. And so what’s happened is a lot of these farms that you know pass down between generations. So the 27-year-old manager of one of the farms called me this morning and she said, Can you get me Dwight’s number? I picked it when I was small, and I miss it. And you’d be surprised how many farmers miss growing it. So Dwight has a client, as I said, and they seem to take whatever he grows. He’s expanded. He started at 15 acres. He’s up to 35, I think he’s going to go, possibly go to 50 next year. So I don’t know if it’s going to ever be make a comeback to what it was, you know, 30 years ago, but it is, there is a market for it still, so hopefully it’ll still be grown, because it is still, you know, everybody talks about kind of gets known for its pizza and basketball teams, but in a lot of places in the world, it’s actually known for its tobacco.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0722_SR_TobaccoFarm_028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 13:56:47.534661

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Time to start shopping for a buyer with the cash and creativity to make over the Providence Place mall.
A July 28 order by Providence County Superior Court Judge Brian Stern lets court-appointed receivers list the mall property for sale, redirecting profits to private lenders owed more than $250 million in principal and interest from a 2011 mortgage loan. The listing expected to hit the market in September also offers a chance to revive the sprawling shopping destination in the heart of downtown Providence — either as a mall, or something else entirely.
Once the symbol of the capital city’s renaissance, the 25-year-old mall has lost its luster  amid losses in flagship tenants and changes to consumer shopping habits. Its future was put in further jeopardy after it was placed in court-appointed receivership last fall. Private lenders in a petition filed on Oct. 29 in Providence County Superior Court alleged former mall owner and operator Brookfield Properties owed them $259 million in principal and interest from a loan taken out in 2011, which was backed by nearly all of its 1.3-million-square-foot footprint.
John Dorsey Jr. and Mark Russo, the pair of West Warwick lawyers named permanent receivers, spent the last eight months readying the property for sale, bringing in a new management company to oversee daily operations and investing nearly $100,000 in repairs and improvements to the shopping center and adjacent parking garage. The receivers also implemented a new code of conduct in March, including a provision that visitors under 18 be accompanied by an adult after 5 p.m. 
The protocol was met with public criticism, but has received positive feedback from tenants and security officers, Dorsey and Russo wrote in a June 17 status update to the court. They also touted improved tenant sales, extensions to existing leases and $800,000 in property insurance premium savings as examples of the turnaround under their watch.
Upcoming improvements include a parking garage maintenance and repair plan, a survey of the mall’s heating and cooling systems and a new housekeeping vendor. These costs helped to shape a final operational budget, which was submitted to Stern, but not made available for public viewing.
But positive changes to mall operations and infrastructure can’t erase the financial troubles of its past. Brookfield, which has owned Providence Place since it acquired prior mall owner GGP Inc. in 2018, still owed $258.5 million in April to the U.S. National Bank Association, the primary creditor for the $305 million loan granted in 2011, according to court filings. The loan matured in May 2024; every extra day the balance goes unpaid comes with an extra $39,000 in interest owed.

Stern’s latest order affirms the request of local bankruptcy attorney Joseph DiOrio, who represents U.S. National Bank Association, to direct any proceeds from the sale of the mall or its assets to its creditors to repay what they are owed.
DiOrio acknowledged requests for comment Tuesday but did not immediately provide a response.
With Stern’s permission, the receivers inked a deal with Chicago-based firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) to serve as broker for the property sale. The agreement was submitted to Stern, but also not available for public view.
Dorsey was removed from the receivership case on Aug. 5 after being tapped to serve as a federal bankruptcy judge.
The mall is expected to go to market in mid-September after JLL finishes its “due diligence” and analysis, Mark Russo, now the sole receiver in the case, confirmed via email Tuesday. 
“As for the process moving forward, JLL will lead a robust marketing effort to identify the highest and best offer for the property,” Russo said.
Rating agency KBRA estimated the appraised value of the property at $240 million in May 2021, down from a $558 million value when the mortgage loan was secured in 2011. Russo did not immediately respond to questions Tuesday regarding whether there will be a new appraisal prior to the listing.
The mall opened in 1999 after a series of delays and changes to financing and development terms. The final funding package for the $460 million project featured a state bond and a tax treaty with the city of Providence. The state deal used mall sales tax revenue to repay the debt on the bond that paid for construction. The state made its final, $73 million payment on the bond in 2019.
A separate, 30-year tax treaty with the city of Providence is set to end in 2028. Under the agreement, the mall pays $500,000 a year in city property taxes. If taxed at fiscal 2026 city commercial rates, the property would be paying nearly $24.9 million in taxes.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday.

A new restaurant there uses a program that supports vendors who are legally blind.,"A new restaurant at the former Sun-n-Sand Motor Hotel in downtown Jackson says it will serve up comfort food in partnership with a state program that provides support to Mississippians who are legally blind.
Hen & Egg was founded by the Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration, the Mississippi Department of Rehabilitation Services and Chef Nick Wallace. 
The old Sun-n-Sand is a midcentury modern structure that’s a short walk from the Capitol. The hotel operated from 1960 to 2001 and was a longtime gathering spot for state legislators and lobbyists, as well as civil rights activists. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History designated it a state landmark in 2020.

Hen & Egg opened to the public Tuesday with operating hours of 7 a.m.-7 p.m Monday through Friday and 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Sundays. The restaurant has an event space on the second floor.
Wallace, who was born and raised in Mississippi, has been featured on several cooking shows, such as “Chopped” and “Top Chef.” He runs Nissan Cafe in the Two Mississippi Museums in downtown Jackson, also in partnership with the Department of Rehabilitation Services. 
Wallace said when the department reached out three years ago to ask him to join the project at the old Sun-n-Sand, it was easy for him to agree. 
“They’re very honest people, and they just want the best for Mississippians,” he said Monday.
The restaurant is part of the Business Enterprise Program, which provides support and opportunities for Mississippians who are legally blind to become food service vendors.

By state and federal law, vendors who are legally blind get priority to operate vending facilities in state-owned and federally-owned buildings.
Hen & Egg’s vendor is Eddie Turner, a Brandon resident who is also the vendor for the Roy M. Wheat Galley at Naval Air Station Meridian and the Micro Market at the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.
Turner, who has been blind his entire life, credits the program with helping him and others make a living and be independent. 
“I just can’t say enough about it. It’s just a great program,” Turner said. “There’s a lot of blind people across the country that benefit from it.”

Dorothy Young is director of the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation for the Blind, which runs the Business Enterprise Program. Young said Hen & Egg was also the idea of the state Department of Finance and Administration.
“The Department of Finance and Administration … wanted to revitalize a lot of state agencies around downtown, and this was just one of the buildings that they invested in,” she said.
The Sun-n-Sand fell into disrepair in the years after it closed. The state bought the building in 2019, demolishing most of it to create a parking lot for state employees. After outcry from preservationists, the commercial part of the hotel was restored in 2021 and turned into a meeting and event space, and now the restaurant.

Narrow yellow signs of “POSTED, no trespassing” hang on the doors and windows of every building.
Half a dozen cars, held hostage with yellow parking boots, remain in a lot behind the student center.
And questions hang in the air: What’s next for the now-empty college that educated students in Gaffney for nearly two centuries? What can the town do to prevent the private university’s campus from falling into disrepair?
As more institutions of higher education close across the country each year, due to financial struggles and falling enrollment, small college towns are grappling with what to do with the sweeping quads, expansive athletic fields and mammoth historic buildings left in the wake.

At least 16 colleges closed in 2024, according to Inside Higher Ed. Fifteen closed the year before.
Now it’s Upstate South Carolina’s turn to face the challenge.
‘A neighborhood school’
Limestone employed nearly 480 people before its closure, all of whom lost their jobs in a city of less than 13,000.
“Obviously we’re devastated that the college closed,” James Taylor, Gaffney’s town administrator, told the SC Daily Gazette. “It’s been a significant contributor to both the economy and culture of Gaffney.”
The campus sits on the site of the former Limestone Springs community. A limestone quarry supported the town. Nearby springs were said to have healing qualities, and the town’s former hotel, which became the college administrative offices, once drew travelers fleeting stifling summers and malaria outbreaks in the Lowcountry.
Founded in 1845 by Thomas Curtis, a Baptist minister from England, the college began as Limestone Springs Female High School. At the time of its opening, it was the first women’s college in South Carolina and among the first in the country.
SC governor calls for study to consider consolidating colleges ahead of ‘enrollment cliff’

As the college grew, Gaffney’s historic residential district built up around it. Hundred-year-old homes stand on either side of the tree-lined boulevard that stretches between downtown Gaffney and the campus.
“These neighborhood folks definitely care about what happens to the college due to the fact that it truly is a ‘neighborhood school,'” said Cassidy Holman, a real estate agent who is helping sell several homes in the area. “People see it every day when they are driving home, riding bikes, walking their dogs or going for their early morning runs.”
Holman said the school often opened up its auditorium to community events, such as musicals, beauty pageants and the annual Peach Festival talent show. The same was true for the tennis courts when the school team wasn’t using them.
State Sen. Harvey Peeler, a Gaffney native and powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, passes by the school nearly every day.
Both his wife and mother are Limestone alumnae and his grandfather’s farm backed up to college property.
“Students on one side of the road and cows on the other side,” Peeler said.
“It’s such a beautiful campus and has such a great history,” he added. “You just think of all the memories there, and it’s just hard to swallow. It’s a gut punch.”
Taylor said the school is using what’s left of its meager endowment to keep the power on and regularly patrol the campus to deter vandals.
‘We may be talking years’
City leaders have been in discussions with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which holds the main lien on the property for a $30 million loan it granted in 2018.
Taylor said it’s the city’s hope the school will remain an educational facility, rather than subdivided into multiple uses.
But as much as residents would like for something to happen quickly, he’s realistic.
“We may be talking years instead of months,” he said.
Holman said her real estate firm has handled listings for university employees who have left town to find new jobs. There are also rental homes that previously catered to the students and sports teams.
“The silver lining is that our real estate market in the Upstate of South Carolina is strong, and potential buyers are definitely out there,” she said.
At least one potential developer has announced plans for repurposing the property.
A private equity firm wants to re-open the campus as a college focused on science, technology, engineering and math, according to the project’s leader and Clover native Dwayne McClure.

“Gaffney sits right on Interstate 85, between the nation’s second largest banking city after New York and one of the fastest-growing manufacturing and innovation hubs in the country,” McClure told the Daily Gazette. “There’s no reason why a university with its geographic proximity to both Charlotte and Greenville-Spartanburg shouldn’t be successful.”
McClure said his firm hopes to do what the administrators of Limestone could not by raising money from private investors to restart the school. He said they’ll work to secure government and industry contracts to keep it operating long term.
“A for-profit institution that derives most of its profit from intellectual property and contracting, that is going to be the economic engine behind the university that will finance further development,” McClure said.
McClure said his firm, Quantum Foundry Capital, has already begun raising $55 million needed to pay off all loans, cover sums still owed to former faculty and ensure all buildings are up to code. The federal government has yet to let bidders inside locked buildings on the 125-acre campus.
If chosen as the buyer, McClure’s group will have to get the school re-accredited. While it goes through that process, he said they hope to work with the state’s technical college system to operate workforce training programs that don’t require accreditation.
McClure said his firm also is working with a group of Limestone alumni, which calls itself Saving Limestone. The goal, after 10 years, would be to turn over management of the school’s endowment to those alumni who wish to invest and remain involved.
Online students lose thousands of dollars following closure of SC’s Limestone University

“If there’s one thing that we’ve noticed from this whole process, it’s that they’ve had no voice in this,” McClure said of the school’s alumni.
The college means a lot to its graduates, he said. It’s where they met their spouse, got married, made some of the biggest decisions in their life.
About a third of McClure’s own high school teachers in Clover were Limestone graduates.
“It was the local institution of higher learning,” he said.
Instead of Limestone becoming part of South Carolina’s history, McClure said his firm wants to see it continue to move the town of Gaffney into the future.
Not many success stories
When it comes to redeveloping empty college campuses across the country, McClure said the sad part is there are not many success stories.
“If you’re lucky, the university gets turned into some sort of (U.S. Department of Defense) outpost, like a training center, or a police academy. Or maybe it gets incorporated with the school district,” he said.
But those publicly-funded uses tend not to come with the same level of economic impact for the community.
The town of Gaffney estimates Limestone previously contributed $150 million annually to the local economy through staff salaries, visitors coming for sporting events and student spending in the town.
“It works, but at best it’s about half the level it was prior,” McClure said “That’s a hard pill to swallow, because every dollar that leaves the community is now a denial of the future of that place.”
SC’s Limestone University to close after nearly 2 centuries

Peeler compared it to how the city of Columbia would look if the University of South Carolina closed its doors.
“To add to the challenge, Limestone is a private institution,” said Peeler, the Senate’s chief budget writer. “The citizens are wanting the state to step up, but it’s a private college. It’s not state supported. It would be easier if it was.”
In Alabama, Birmingham-Southern University, a 168-year-old college affiliated with the United Methodist Church, remains closed after two potential sales fell through over the past year.
A trash disposal company purchased the former College of St. Joseph campus in Vermont, turning it into a commercial driver’s license training hub for employees.
A nonprofit has repurposed the former campus of a Catholic university in Ohio, Chatfield College. It offers high school students access to college financial aid and career coaching to jobless adults, especially those recovering from addiction.
And in Philippi, West Virginia, repurposing of Alderson Broaddus University is gradually proceeding since the Baptist-affiliated closed after more than 150 years in operation.
The story of Alderson Broaddus
“I didn’t want to see this place start to crumble,” said Craig Phillips, who bought the campus at auction for $5 million in January 2024. “I was just afraid it was going to go to shambles.”
Phillips, who has made his living developing grocery stores and small shopping centers, said he and his daughter have rented some office space to local businesses. They host weddings and class reunions in the campus chapel and event space. And area sports teams have used the athletics fields for summer camps.
“Everything we can do to keep it going until something bigger comes along,” Phillips told the Daily Gazette.
It hasn’t been easy. The 187-acre campus came with 625,000 square feet of building space.
Meanwhile, the town has a population of less than 3,000. The county — Barbour County — has less than 15,500 people, according to 2020 Census data, with an economy mostly reliant on coal mining.
Phillips has replaced water lines on the campus and a couple roofs. When the school closed, it was sudden and the entire staff left without making any preparations for winter. When he first walked through the buildings, coffee mugs were still sitting on desks, just as they had been left.
Last September, Phillips inked a deal with West Virginia Wesleyan College to open a satellite campus in one of the buildings.
Wesleyan, using a state grant aimed at helping meet West Virginia’s health care needs, has enrolled more than 18 working nurses in a program that will take them from licensed practical nurses, a two-year degree, to a bachelor’s degree, said Provost Lynn Linder.
Alderson Broaddus had been known for its physicians assistant program. Wesleyan used the grant funding to update Alderson Broaddus’ simulation lab so it could continue educating people for the health field.
Closure of the private college was hard on the community. Some 150 people lost their jobs. The town lost a major employer and part of its identity.
Linder saw how difficult it was firsthand while speaking with a former Alderson Broaddus student who was enrolling at Wesleyan to finish her degree. The student’s parents were with her. Both the wife and husband had been Alderson Broaddus employees.
Linder said she is confident Wesleyan’s program on the Alderson Broaddus campus will succeed because it’s focused on a major workforce need for the area and supports nearby Broaddus Hospital.
“Colleges cant just do business as usual and expect not only to survive but to thrive,” Linder said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC_0842-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 13:56:47.534661

A nonprofit plans to ask four states to participate in a $19.5 million initiative aimed at transforming how people transition from prison to the workforce.
The Fair Chance to Advance initiative, led by the national nonprofit Jobs for the Future, hopes to provide funding and support over four years to help states expand access to postsecondary education in prison and strengthen connections to employment after release.
The new initiative comes as state prison systems across the country continue to launch and expand education and work training programs. With the restoration and expansion of federal Pell Grant eligibility to incarcerated students in July 2023, the U.S. Department of Education estimated then that 760,000 people were newly eligible for federal financial aid — fueling interest in prison education efforts.
But that momentum has not always been enough to connect formerly incarcerated people to well-paying jobs and opportunities that align with their qualifications — even for those who have earned advanced degrees — due to systemic barriers such as employer bias and restrictive occupational licensing requirements.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“What’s been the missing piece is making sure that those pathways are connected to quality jobs,” said Rebecca Villarreal, the senior director in the Center for Justice and Economic Advancement at Jobs for the Future.
Approximately 77 million U.S. adults, or about 1 in 3, have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and can face persistent barriers to securing education, employment, housing and other basic resources after incarceration.
States can apply for the program; full proposals are due in October. Each of the four participating states chosen will represent a different U.S. Census region, according to Villarreal. Each state is expected to receive funding, technical assistance and access to a national peer learning network as part of a two-phase process beginning in February 2026.
A key goal of the initiative, Villarreal said, is to make education and workforce training acquired during incarceration more visible and transferable to employers. The program also aims to ensure that prison-based education and work training align with in-demand occupations and the broader labor market needs of each participating state.
As part of the initiative, participating states also will collect data to track post-incarceration education and employment outcomes.

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 8 had burned more than 100,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
By that time it was already Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 116,859 acres with 6% containment as of Aug. 12. It’s believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, is also believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,549 as of Aug. 12, and is 30% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 51% contained and has burned an estimated 28,569 acres since it was started by lightning on July 12.

Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Lee Fire amid ‘extreme drought’ spreads as officials prepare for Wednesday heat


By: Delilah Brumer - Tuesday August 12, 2025 11:03 am


















  A photo posted to the Rio Blanco County Sheriff’s Office Facebook on Aug. 12, 2025. (Rio Blanco County Sheriff’s Office Facebook)
Containment of the Lee Fire west of Meeker has dropped slightly to 6%, compared to its 7% containment Monday. A Tuesday morning map of the fire, which is the fifth-largest in state history, showed 116,859 acres burned. That’s more than 3,000 new acres burned since Monday.
The Lee Fire started in Rio Blanco County and has spread toward Rifle in Garfield County, pushed by strong winds and dry conditions.
During a community meeting at Colorado Mountain College on Monday night, incident meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld said smoke conditions are expected to improve in Rifle throughout Tuesday as winds change. But fire crews still face challenges ahead, especially moving into Wednesday, Schoenfeld added.
“Wednesday is really the day to watch with regards to fire weather,” Schoenfeld said. “Wednesday is going to be warmer, and it’s going to be more of an unstable atmosphere.”
“In the past 30 days, we have gotten 5% of the normal precipitation, putting the area in extreme drought,” she added.

Lee Fire becomes 5th largest in Colorado history as Oak Fire burns to the south


By: Delilah Brumer - Monday August 11, 2025 12:19 pm


















The Lee Fire near the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County has grown to be the fifth-largest wildfire in state history as crews continued to battle fires in several parts of Colorado on Monday.
Dry weather and strong winds have pushed the Lee Fire south toward Garfield County, blazing through more than 113,000 acres. It was at 7% containment as of Monday. The fire was believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The state’s newest wildfire, the Oak Fire, sparked Sunday west of Pagosa Springs in Archuleta County. The blaze prompted mandatory evacuations in Elk Park and pre-evacuation orders in other nearby areas.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm


















High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

When the Affordable Care Act was passed in March 2010, the goal was to help more Americans get health insurance. And, indeed, the establishment of online marketplaces and a broadening of the eligibility guidelines for Medicaid accomplished that.
Fifteen years later, however, that system is anything but user-friendly.
Young adults looking for health insurance will likely benefit from talking with so-called navigators who work for the online marketplaces. But if you want to go it alone, here are some tips about shopping for a plan, based on the advice of policy experts and people who have spent hundreds of hours helping others navigate this unwieldy set-up.
Buckle up.
Start here
Begin your search at least two months before your 26th birthday. In some cases, you can sign up for a plan in advance so that it takes effect on your birthday.
First, find out if your family plan ends on your birthday or at the end of your birthday month. A few states allow young adults to stay on their family plan until they are 29, with certain conditions and, generally, higher costs. A navigator will know more.
You may have the option to stay, for a limited time, on your family’s plan under COBRA, a federal program that allows those with group health plans to extend their coverage past age 26. Odds that you will be approved for an extension are even higher if you can claim a disability.
Be aware, though, that this option will involve a considerable expense, since you will be required to pay the entire premium (the employer will no longer pay what is usually a substantial share). Those who claim a disability can often stay on the family plan after age 26, depending on the type of insurance the family holds.
If you’re undergoing medical treatment and can’t change hospitals or doctors, paying this premium may be your best course. You don’t have this option, however, if your family is insured through an Obamacare plan.
Before you start your search, make a list of the medicines and physicians you rely on, and highlight those you can’t do without. Rank them, even.
It’s quite likely that you will have fewer choices on the marketplace than you had on a parent’s plan. Be prepared to make some switches and trade-offs.

Find the right marketplace
Thirty-two states have adopted the federal marketplace as the place residents can go to compare and buy insurance policies. The rest run their own online marketplaces. You can find out here where to shop for insurance policies in your state.
Make sure you land at an official ACA website. There are many look-alikes run by private insurance brokers. The federal marketplace is found at healthcare.gov and nowhere else.
Note that official state marketplaces sometimes have unusual names. The New York State of Health, Kynect (Kentucky), Covered California, and CoverMe (Maine) are examples.
In states that use the federal marketplace, shoppers can find assistance here. On the state-based marketplaces, there is often a “find local help” button or a tab that directs you to a person who can help you find a good plan.
You will generally be asked to choose a broker, who is paid a commission if you sign up, or an “assister,” who provides the service at no cost. Assisters have received special training in the marketplace they serve, and, because they provide the service free, they have no financial incentive to steer you to a plan that pays a commission to the seller.
Assisters are often navigators who are funded by the marketplace, but in some cases they work for hospitals, health plans, or local nonprofits. You’ll have to ask.
While navigators are generally a surefire option for sound advice, they may become harder to find now that the Trump administration has cut funding for them in states that rely on the federal marketplace. (States that run their own marketplaces are unaffected.)
Many nonprofits and states run excellent programs that offer free assistance. And if, for example, you’re in the middle of cancer treatment, an assister affiliated with your hospital may offer better advice on picking a plan, since they will know which ones have contracts that may cover more of your expenses.
Ideally, these experts will walk you through the process and know which buttons to push to ensure you get the best coverage for your needs at the best rate for which you are eligible.
Sign up
Once you’re on an official website that markets plans under the ACA, you will be asked to enter your personal information as well as an estimate of your income.
Forty states and the District of Columbia cover single young adults with no children under Medicaid if their income is low enough to qualify. If you’re eligible, you should be redirected to the Medicaid website to start the enrollment process, or you may enroll directly on the marketplace site.
But be aware that the Republicans’ recently passed domestic policy bill has increased the requirements and the paperwork required to get on, and stay on, Medicaid.
Medicaid, a joint federal and state program that provides health insurance to low-income Americans, does not charge its members a premium, and it covers medications at a nominal cost or free. The caveat is that those enrolled in the program have a smaller number of in-network doctors and hospitals to choose from.
If your income is above the threshold for Medicaid, you will need to shop on the marketplace for a policy.
On most sites, a search tool allows you to check whether your doctor or hospital is in a particular plan’s network. But beware: The directories on which this search relies are notoriously inaccurate, despite federal laws mandating otherwise.
So, before you select a plan, call the doctor or hospital to confirm they accept the insurance plan you’re considering purchasing.
Do the math
When it comes to the math, it’s better to work on a computer than a phone. Generally, you can compare the costs of, and coverage offered by, only three plans at a time.
The following factors include premiums (taking account of any subsidy you get based on your income), as well as other expenses you’ll have to pay, called collective cost sharing:

The deductible — the amount you generally have to pay out-of-pocket before your insurance kicks in. (You may get a few “covered” visits with a primary care doctor; these won’t count against the deductible.)
Copayments — a fixed payment that you owe for any visit to a doctor or emergency room.
Coinsurance (this one can break the bank) — a percentage of the total bill, generally applied to hospital bills, that you have to pay. The plan may make it sound small, say, 10% to 30%. But if you have, for example, the common 80-20 split (in which the insurer pays 80% and you pay 20%), that can add up to a substantial sum. A single day in the hospital can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, and 20% percent of that is a large amount.
The out-of-pocket maximum — the most you’ll have to pay out in a year, so long as you stay in network and pay the deductible.

Doing the math means looking at this holistically, balancing what you can pay in a premium against what you can afford for the above charges. If the deductible is over $3,000 and the out-of-pocket maximum allowed yearly is $9,200 — do you have that much money on hand?
Generally, the lower the monthly premium in a plan, the higher the share of costs you’ll have to pay should you need medical care. Note that an insurer may offer very different plans on the same marketplace, with different payment policies and networks.
People with incomes up to 2½ times the poverty level may gain some relief from cost-sharing charges, but only if they sign up for silver plans. Plans are typically labeled bronze, silver, gold, and platinum; each tier reflects the percentage of your medical expenses that your plan pays overall. Bronze plans offer the least amount of coverage.
Choose wisely
Once you’ve narrowed your choices to a few plans, study each closely.
A plan with a low deductible might require a $1,000 daily copayment, or 50% coinsurance (you pay 50%) for hospital stays. A plan that lists your desired hospital system as in-network may include only some of its locations, and not necessarily the ones close to you or that offer the type of care you need.
When looking at a plan’s details, make sure to scroll down and read its “summary of benefits and coverage” for examples of the plan’s coverage of common medical needs. Pay close attention to which services require preauthorization and, for example, how many physical therapy visits they’ll cover each year. Preauthorization can be a long and cumbersome process.
Generally, the lower the premium, the more preauthorization will be required and the more limited the coverage will be. And check what drugs the plan covers (called the formulary) to see if yours are included, as well as its network of providers, to see whether your doctors are in it.
Marketplace plans tend to have limited offerings compared with job-based insurance; there aren’t as many doctors and hospitals to choose from. Click on the “provider directory” to see if an insurer’s network includes doctors and specialists you’re most likely to need, and hospitals that are acceptable and accessible to you.
Check to see if the policy offers any coverage for out-of-network providers. Some will pay, say, 60% or 70% of approved charges. It’s a useful perk if you need to see an out-of-network specialist, or if the wait for an in-network appointment is too long.
One study found that patients with marketplace plans have access to only 40% of doctors near their home, on average, and in some areas that figure was as low as 25%. It’s quite likely even lower for mental health providers.
A backstop
If you’ve tried to choose a plan and you’re still confused, look for one of the “easy pricing” or standard plans. These conform to certain basic standards laid out by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees the marketplaces for the federal government. These plans offer some primary care appointments before you have to start paying the deductible.
The government says these plans must carry the label “easy pricing” on federal marketplace sites. But they may be identified differently on state-run marketplaces. In New York state, for example, they are simply marked with an ST (for standard).
Still, funding for premium subsidies is in place for this year at least, and free expert assistance is still out there, so don’t delay. There are good deals to be had, if only you put in the work.
Good luck.

That is the age at which the Affordable Care Act declares that young adults generally must get off their family’s plan and figure out their coverage themselves.
When the ACA was voted into law in 2010, what’s known as its dependent coverage expansion was immediately effective, guaranteeing health insurance to millions of young Americans up to age 26 who would otherwise not have had coverage.
But for years, Republicans have whittled away at the infrastructure of the original ACA. Long gone is the requirement to buy insurance. Plans sold in the ACA’s online insurance marketplaces have no stringent quality standards. Costs keep rising, and eligibility requirements and subsidies are moving targets.
The erosion of the law has now created an “insurance cliff” for Americans who are turning 26 and don’t have a job that provides medical coverage.
Some, scared off by the complexity of picking a policy and by the price tags, tumble over the edge and go without insurance in a health system where the rate for an emergency room visit can be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars.

Today, an estimated 15% of 26-year-olds go uninsured, which, according to a KFF analysis, is the highest rate among Americans of any age.
If they qualify, young adults can sign up for Medicaid, the federal-state program for Americans with low incomes or disabilities, in most but not all states.
Otherwise, many buy cheap subpar insurance that leaves them with insurmountable debt following a medical crisis. Others choose plans with extremely limited networks, losing access to longtime doctors and medicines.
They often find those policies online, in what has become a dizzyingly complicated system of government-regulated insurance marketplaces created by the ACA.
The marketplaces vary in quality from state to state; some are far better than others. But they generally offer few easily identifiable, affordable, and workable choices.
“The good news is that the ACA gave young people more options,” said Karen Pollitz, who directed consumer information and insurance oversight at the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration.
“The bad news is the good stuff is hidden in a minefield of really bad options that’ll leave you broke if you get sick.”

Publicly funded counselors called “navigators” or “assisters” can help insurance seekers choose a plan. But those programs vary by state, and often customers don’t realize that the help is available. The Trump administration has cut funding to publicize and operate those navigator programs.
In addition, changes to Medicaid eligibility in the policy bill recently passed by Congress could mean that millions more ACA enrollees lose their insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Those changes threaten the very viability of the ACA marketplaces, which currently provide insurance to 24 million Americans.
In dozens of interviews, young adults described the unsettling and devastating consequences of having inadequate insurance, or no insurance at all.
MUST READ: A guide to finding health insurance once you turn 26
Damian Phillips, 26, a reporter at a West Virginia newspaper, considered joining the Navy to get insurance as his 26th birthday approached. Instead, he felt he “didn’t make enough to justify having health insurance” and has reluctantly gone without it.
Ethan Evans, a 27-year-old aspiring actor in Chicago who works in retail, fell off his parents’ plan and temporarily signed up for Medicaid. But the diminished mental health coverage meant cutting back on visits to his longtime therapist.
Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat and the first Gen Z member of Congress, was able to quit his job and run for office at 25 only because he could stay on his mother’s plan until he turned 26, he said.
Now 28, he is insured through his federal job.
“The ACA was groundbreaking legislation, including the idea that every American needs health care,” he said. “But there are pitfalls, and one of them is that when young adults turn 26, they fall into this abyss.”
Why 26?
Back in 2010, the decision to make 26 the cutoff age for staying on a parent’s insurance was “kind of arbitrary,” recalled Nancy-Ann DeParle, deputy chief of staff for policy in the Obama White House.
“My kids were young , and I was trying to imagine when my child would be an adult.”
Before that time, children were often kicked off family plans at much younger ages, typically 18.
The Obama administration’s idea was that young adults were most likely settling into careers and jobs with insurance by 26. If they still didn’t have access to job-based insurance, Medicaid and the ACA marketplaces would offer alternatives, the thinking went.
But over the years, the courts, Congress, and the first Trump administration eviscerated provisions of the ACA. By 2022, a shopper on a federal government-run marketplace had more than 100 choices, many of which included expensive trade-offs, presented in a way that made comparisons difficult without spreadsheets.
Jack Galanty, 26, a freelance designer in Los Angeles, tried to plan for his 26th birthday by seeking coverage on the California insurance marketplace that would ensure treatment for his mild cerebral palsy and for HIV prevention.
“You’re scrolling for what feels like years, looking at 450 little slides, at the little bars, and trying to remember, ‘Was the one I liked No. 12 or 13?’” he recalled. “It feels like it’s nearly impossible to make a good choice in this scenario.”
https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Kayla-Anderson_final.mp4
Out-of-pocket expenses have soared. Complex plans in the lightly regulated marketplaces featured rising premiums, high deductibles, and requirements that patients pay a significant portion of the cost of care, often 20% — a charge known as coinsurance.
More than half of Americans ages 18 to 29 have incurred medical debt in the past five years, a KFF Health News data investigation found. Few have the reserves to pay it off.
The networks of doctors to choose from in these plans are often so limited that an insured person struggles to get timely appointments. It can even be hard to find the official websites amid an explosion of look-alikes operated by commercial brokers.
Sharing her contact information with one site that appeared legitimate left Lydia Herne, a social media producer in Brooklyn, “drowning” in texts and phone calls offering plans of uncertain and unregulated quality. “It never ends,” said Herne, 27.
Young Invincibles, an advocacy group representing young adults, runs its own “navigator” program to help young people choose health insurance plans.
“We hear the frustration,” said Martha Sanchez, the group’s former director of health policy and advocacy. “Twenty-six-year-olds have had negative experiences in a process that’s become really complex. Many throw up their hands.”
Elizabeth Mathis, 29, and Evan Pack, 30, a married couple in Salt Lake City, turned to the marketplaces two years ago, after Pack went uninsured for a “really scary” year after he turned 26.
“Every time he got in the car, I thought, ‘What if?’” Mathis said.
The couple pays more than $200 a month for a high-deductible health plan backed by a federal subsidy (the kind set to expire next year). It’s a significant expense, but they wanted to be sure they had access to contraception and an antidepressant.
But last year, Pack suffered serious eye problems and underwent an emergency appendectomy. Their plan left them $9,000 in debt, for medical care billed at over $20,000.
“Technically, we gambled in the right direction,” Mathis said. “But I don’t feel like we’ve won.”
The affordability problem
The ACA was supposed to help consumers find affordable, high-quality plans online. The legislation also tried to expand Medicaid programs, which are administered by states, to provide health insurance to low-income Americans.
But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could not be forced to expand Medicaid. Ten states, led mostly by Republicans, have not done so, leaving up to 1.5 million Americans, who could have qualified for coverage, without insurance.
Even where Medicaid is available to 26-year-olds, the transition has often proved precarious.
Madeline Nelkin of New Jersey, who was studying social work, applied for Medicaid coverage before her 26th birthday in April 2024 because her university’s insurance premiums were more than $5,000 annually.
But it was September before her Medicaid coverage kicked in, leaving her uninsured while she fought a chest infection over the summer.
“People tell you to think ahead, but I didn’t think that meant six months,” she said.
https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Daisy-Creager_final.mp4
When Megan Hughes, 27, of Hartland, Maine, hit the cliff, she went without. An aide for children with developmental delays, she has a thyroid condition and polycystic ovary syndrome.
She looked for a health care plan but found it hard to understand the marketplace. (She didn’t know there were navigators who could help.) Now she can’t afford her medicine or see her endocrinologist.
“I’m tired all the time,” Hughes said. “My cycles are not regular anymore at all. When I do get one, it’s debilitating.” She is hoping a new job will provide insurance later this year.
Traditionally, most Americans with private health insurance got it through their jobs. But the job market has changed dramatically since the ACA became law, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, with the rise of a gig economy.
Over 30% of people ages 18 to 29 said in recent surveys that they were working or have worked in short-term, part-time, or irregular jobs.
The ACA requires organizations with 50 or more employees to offer insurance to people working 30 hours per week. This has led to a growing number of contract employees who work up to, but not past, the hourly limit.
Many companies, which say they can’t afford the rising costs of traditional insurance, offer their employees only a modicum of help, perhaps around $200 per month toward buying a marketplace plan, or a bare-bones company plan.
Young people juggling part-time jobs and insurance options face bumpy, daunting transitions.
In Oklahoma, Daisy Creager, 29, has had three employers over the past three years. Insurance was important to her, not least because her former husband had Type 1 diabetes.
As she left the first of those jobs, her husband’s endocrinologist helped the couple stockpile less expensive insulin from Canada, since they would be uninsured.
After a few months, they bought a marketplace plan, but it was expensive and “didn’t cover a lot,” she said.
When she found a new job, she dropped that plan, only to discover that her new insurance coverage didn’t start until the end of her first month of employment. The couple would be uninsured for a few weeks.
A few days later, she came home to find her husband unconscious on the floor, in a diabetic coma. After hovering near death in an intensive care unit for four days, he woke up and began to recover.
“I think I’ve done everything right,” Creager said. “So why am I in a position where the health insurance available to me doesn’t cover what I need, or I can barely afford my premiums, or worse, at times I don’t even have it?”
Kathryn Russell, 27, developed excruciating back pain two months before her 26th birthday. After extensive testing, doctors determined she needed a complex surgery, which her surgeon couldn’t schedule until after she would be off her family’s insurance plan.
Forget the pain and the fear of the operation, she said, it was insurance that kept her up at night. “There’s this impending terror of, ‘What am I going to do?’” she recalled.
(One day before she turned 26, her father’s company agreed to keep her on his plan for six more months, if he paid higher premiums.)
The idea that the ACA would offer a variety of good options for people turning 26 has not worked as well as the legislation’s authors had hoped. The “job lock” tying insurance to employment has long plagued the United States workforce.
Young adults need guidance on their options beforehand, said Sanchez of Young Invincibles. None of those interviewed for this story, for example, knew there were navigators to help them find insurance on the online marketplaces.
Experts agree that the marketplaces need stronger regulation.
In 2023, the federal government defined clearer standards for what plans in each tier of insurance should offer, such as better prescription drug benefits, defined copays for X-rays, or coverage for emergency room visits.
Certain types of basic care, such as primary care, should require just a small copay for at least a small number of initial visits. Each insurer must offer at least one plan that complies with these new standards for every level, known as an “easy pricing” option or a “standard plan.”
Most plans on the marketplaces don’t meet these criteria. Federal and state regulators had long planned to cull such “noncompliant” plans, gradually — fearing that doing so too quickly would scare insurers away from participating.
But with the priorities of the new Trump administration now in focus, and a Republican majority in Congress, it’s far from clear what course President Donald Trump, who sought to repeal the ACA outright in his first term, will take.
There are hints: Subsidies to help Americans buy insurance, adopted during the Biden administration, are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless the Republican-led Congress extends them.
If the subsidies expire, premiums are likely to rise sharply for plans sold on the marketplaces, leaving insurance out of reach for many more young adults.

Smith recently retired from the Columbus Police Department as a sergeant and previously oversaw the city’s School Resource Officer Division. She is a former school resource officer for Bartholomew County Schools.
“Providing a safe and secure environment for Hoosier students to learn and grow is a top priority for me both as Governor and as a father and grandfather. Our Office of School Safety puts that priority into action, and Sergeant Julie Q. Smith is uniquely qualified and dedicated to this mission to strengthen our schools and help students thrive,” Braun said.
Smith is a national instructor for the National Association of School Resource Officers as well as regional director for the Midwest states, and is president of the Indiana School Resource Officers Association.
“I’ve dedicated my career to keeping students safe, and it’s an honor to put my experience to work strengthening Indiana schools and communities as the Director of the Office of School Safety,” she said.
Braun created the Office of School Safety as part of his public safety agenda.
Indiana’s Secured School Safety Board will be absorbed by Braun’s Office of School Safety. The board, already under the Department of Homeland Security, oversees millions of dollars in annual safety grants awarded to Indiana schools.
Last year, for example, the board approved $24 million in safety grant funding shared to nearly 500 Indiana schools. In the new state biennial budget, the amount grows to to $27.1 million each year.

State Attorney General James Uthmeier is refusing to defend the law, which he considers unconstitutional. (Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)A gun violence prevention group is calling upon the U.S. Supreme Court to reject a legal challenge to Florida’s ban on individuals under 21 years of age purchasing long guns.
Brady, the gun safety group formerly known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court on Friday urging the justices to decline the opportunity to rule on the 2018 state law.
That provision was just one part of the wide-ranging Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Scott just weeks after 17 people were slain in the mass shooting in Parkland on Valentine’s Day in 2018.
Uthmeier, appointed to serve as the state’s attorney general by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year, announced in March that he and the governor believe the law is unconstitutional, saying that if “the NRA decides to seek further review at SCOTUS, I am directing my office not to defend this law.”
The NRA filed its petition for certiorari in May. It calls for the Supreme Court justices to review the split among federal circuit courts over whether adults under 21 enjoy Second Amendment rights. The Third, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits have ruled that they do, while the Tenth and Eleventh circuits have upheld laws banning firearm purchases by adults under 21.
Jeffrey DeSousa, the acting solicitor general in the Florida Office of Legal Affairs, has so far filed two 30-day extensions in response to the NRA’s petition, with his response now due at the high court by Aug. 20.
The Brady group is criticizing Uthmeier for his refusal to defend the law.
“After the horrors at Stoneman Douglas in Parkland in 2018 and courageous advocacy by traumatized  survivors, the Republican majorities in the Florida Legislature and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis collaborated on a commonsense age requirement for purchasing and receiving firearms,” said Brady Chief Legal Officer Douglas Letter, forgetting that it was actually Rick Scott who signed the law.
“Not only have similar age restrictions existed since our founding as a Nation, they are consistent with modern scientific knowledge regarding physical brain development and our constantly expanding knowledge and understanding of mature brain functioning,” Letter said in a statement.
“In refusing to do his job, Attorney General Uthmeier shamefully denies these facts and denies the success of the law in saving lives and decreasing the rates of gun deaths of the state’s minors. The Supreme Court should deny the NRA’s profit-driven request, and allow this bipartisan success to continue.”
The Florida House in March passed a bill (HB 759) that would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. It was the third straight year the chamber has done so, but both times the legislation failed to become law because it never moved in the Florida Senate.
Bob Jarvis, professor of constitutional law at Nova Southeastern University’s Shepard Broad College of Law, says he does expect the state to file a response in the NRA case, and that there’s a parallel to how a group of blue states reacted to the evolving issue of same-sex marriage a decade ago.
“In the Obergefell case some years ago (involving same-sex marriage bans), the attorneys general of California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania (among others) refused to defend their state’s same-sex marriage bans,” he said. “Instead, they filed an amicus brief supporting Obergefell. I would expect Florida to do the same thing here (i.e., not defend Florida’s law and file an amicus brief in support of the NRA).”

(Photo by Ryan Berry for Washington State Standard)John Braun, the top Republican in the Washington state Senate, launched his campaign Tuesday to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Marle Gluesenkamp Perez next year.
Braun, Senate Minority Leader since 2020, will take on the two-term incumbent in southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, which has drawn national attention as an electoral battleground that helps decide which party controls the U.S. House.
“I think the incumbent is genuine and good at press releases but hasn’t really done much to improve the lives of residents in southwest Washington,” Braun told the Standard on Tuesday.
The district encompasses Clark, Cowlitz, Lewis, Pacific, Wahkiakum, and Skamania counties and a small part of Thurston County. 
President Donald Trump won it three times. But Republicans lost the congressional seat in 2022 when Gluesenkamp Perez, co-owner of an auto repair and machine shop, beat Republican Joe Kent, a former Army Special Forces soldier who Trump backed.
It was one of that year’s biggest ballot upsets and thinned the ranks of Republicans in Washington’s 12-member congressional delegation from three to two.
Gluesenkamp Perez defeated Kent in their rematch last year while in the presidential race, Trump soundly beat Democrat Kamala Harris in the congressional district.
Braun, a Centralia resident in his fourth term as a state senator, brings legislative experience, electoral know-how and a brand of Republicanism he hopes will appeal to independent and GOP voters who shunned Kent.
But Braun must mend fences with those supporters. Some of them weren’t happy that the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, under Braun’s guidance, recruited and backed candidates in legislative races in 2024 that were not on board with the MAGA agenda.
In a tacit acknowledgement, Braun seemed to make a move in their direction this past week with his boisterous defense of Trump’s signature policy for tax cuts and spending reforms. This after he and the caucus had been intentional in their efforts to distance themselves from their party’s actions in the other Washington.
Asked whether he has Trump’s backing, Braun said there is “a clear path to earning the president’s support. We’ve got to do the work first.”

“I worry, if the judge does not set the bond hearing and up until the court date, and, obviously, she does get sent back to Mexico,” said Gina Martinez, the mother of Giovanna Hernandez Martinez, with the help of a translator on Sunday. “All of our family is here, all of her siblings, she has built her education here, she has all of her friends here.”
Giovanna Martinez has been at an ICE detention facility in Richwood, Louisiana since Friday. She had been in the Pickens County Jail since Tuesday after she was stopped along Interstate 20 because of an alleged traffic violation, according to the Leeds Police Department.

According to a statement issued by Paul Irwin on Thursday, chief of police for the Leeds Police Department, an officer in an unmarked vehicle driving along the interstate when the car driven by Giovanna passed the officer and was driving “at a high rate of speed of over 80 mph. The vehicle came within feet of striking other vehicles and erratically changed lanes.”
Giovanna’s brother, Dilan Hernandez, disputes that she was driving recklessly.
“On the dash cam it was obvious that wasn’t the case at all,” he said. “My sister was speeding a little bit, but we feel that, under the circumstances, it wasn’t fair at all.”
An officer in a different police vehicle then stopped Giovanna Martinez and asked for her driver’s license. She provided an identification card issued from Mexico. Officers then reached out to immigration agents per the department’s policy who then arrived on scene and took her into custody.
“I was really afraid at first,” Gina Martinez said when she first learned of her daughter’s arrest. “I didn’t know what was going on, what was going to happen. I didn’t know if it was a regular traffic stop or if immigration had gotten her. I didn’t know where she was going, and she didn’t pick up her phone.”
Giovanna’s parents brought her and her siblings to the country from Mexico in 2008, and she has been trying to get her citizenship, according to her family.
Multiple groups and organizations have spoken out in support of Giovanna Martinez since she was taken into custody by ICE on Tuesday. The Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama said in a statement last week that she is a trusted community partner and a role model. Giovanna Martinez operates a consulting business, Juntos Coaching and Consulting, that assists youth in Alabama.
“This is another example of the administration’s indiscriminate immigration enforcement actions,” said UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguía in a statement on Friday. “They are not going after ‘the worst of the worst,’ but are instead detaining a hardworking, beloved member of the community.”
Steven J. Raica, the bishop of Birmingham, urged people to work toward improving the immigration system.
“As always, we urge our lawmakers, community leaders, and every person of good will to take this issue seriously, to work diligently toward reasonable solutions and sensible accommodations whenever necessary, and to strengthen our nation as a place of hope for those yearning to ‘breathe free,’” he said.
Gina and her children attended mass at St. Theresa’s Catholic Church in Leeds, Alabama on Sunday where congregants prayed for Giovanna. Afterward, some attended a workshop where an immigration attorney informed people of their rights should they encounter immigration agents and provided an update on SB 53, recently passed by the Alabama Legislature, that creates the crime of human smuggling.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250810_152354-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-12 12:59:06.304648

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds celebrates SNAP waivers approval in Washington, D.C.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is planning to challenge U.S. Sen. Jon Husted next year for one of Ohio’s two seats in the Senate, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Tuesday. The race would surely take on a national profile as Democrats try to take control of a closely divided chamber and act as a counterweight to President Donald Trump.
The paper said that Ohio labor leaders have confirmed that Brown is getting into the race after losing Ohio’s other U.S. Senate seat in 2024, which he had held since 2007. Brown, 72, has maintained strong ties to organized labor.
Spokespeople for the Ohio Democratic Party and several others with ties to Brown couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. 
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, has traveled to Columbus twice in recent weeks, apparently trying to persuade Brown to make the race.
Husted, who was formerly the Republican lieutenant governor, is seeking his first election to the Senate seat in November 2026. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed him earlier this year to fill the seat that was vacated when JD Vance was elevated to the vice presidency. 
Brown, who had served as Ohio secretary of state, defeated then-U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine in 2006. Known as a Democrat who can attract independent and Republican votes, Brown lost by less than four percentage points in 2024 in a state that Trump carried by more than 11.
The presence of Brown in the Ohio U.S. Senate race might in some ways be a repeat of last year’s against Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland auto dealer. That contest turned out to be one of the most expensive races in U.S. history.
The Senate currently has 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. 
The Cook Political Report last week rated the races that are on the ballot this cycle. Of the 22 seats held by Republicans, it rated only one — an open seat in North Carolina — as a toss-up. Another, held by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, was rated as leaning Republican. 
Three more, including the Ohio seat held by Husted, were rated likely Republican. It’s unknown whether that will change if Brown makes the race.
With tariffs and deportations possibly feeding inflation and weakening the job market — and with legislation that blew up the deficit and slashed the social safety net while cutting taxes for the rich — Trump’s popularity is well under water. If problems worsen into the next year, that could drag down his fellow Republicans who stand for election.
Right now, gaming and technology businessman Chris Volpe of Columbus is the only officially announced Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026, pending an announcement from Brown.
Ohio 2026 Election
In addition to the statewide race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Husted, Ohio voters will also have an open-seat race for governor in 2026, along with all of Ohio’s other statewide executive offices, as all current officeholders are term-limited.
In the governor’s race, Dr. Amy Acton, the former director of the Ohio Department of Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate. On the Republican side, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and political newcomer Heather Hill are vying for the GOP nomination.
While there has been speculation that Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel might also run in the Republican primary, he has not yet made any announcement of a decision either way. The Ohio Republican Party officially endorsed Ramaswamy in May.
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026. Also running in the Republican primary for secretary of state is retired Air Force intel officer Marcell Strbich.
A Republican primary for the nomination for Ohio treasurer features former state Sen. Niraj Antani, current state Sen. Kristina Roegner, and Lake County Treasurer Michael Zuren.
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. Former state representative Elliot Forhan has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Attorney General. No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer.
The state also has one Ohio Supreme Court race in 2026. The sole remaining Democratic justice on the 6-1 court, Jennifer Brunner, faces a challenge from Republican Justice Patrick F. Fischer, as Fischer would be, by law, too old to run for reelection to his own seat in 2028.

(Larimer County Sheriff's Office)Whenever an “emergency” is declared by our government — whether it’s in the name of public safety, public health, or pretty much any other reason — many Coloradans on either side of the political aisle are skeptical, as are a lot of journalists, and even some elected officials.
Sometimes the increased government control may be justified, other times not so much. But every time emergency measures are proposed, the instinct of most Coloradans has been to investigate the facts for fear of yet another power grab.
Oddly, there’s one government “emergency” that an alarming number of citizens, media outlets, and elected officials across the political spectrum not only won’t investigate, not only will attack or censor anyone questioning, but will promote outright disinformation around it to ensure a lack of transparency or accountability.
That “emergency”? Wildfire.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
What is it about the fear of wildfire that cuts off rational thinking, despite it only killing about 500 people since 1990 in the U.S., an average of 14 people per year?
While every death from wildfire is of course a tragedy, the most credible threat is home loss, firefighting expenses, and costs of rebuilding. Luckily, the overwhelming scientific consensus points to home hardening and defensible space pruning up to 100 feet around houses as the most effective way to save homes and lives.
While there has been some small progress on home hardening in Colorado, the vast majority of funding and conversation around wildfire is still focused on cutting down vast swaths of public forests in the name of “community protection.”
Surely, if we’re spending millions of taxpayer dollars on “wildfire fuel reduction” logging while gutting environmental laws to push through even more — including rescinding the Roadless Rule, “emergency” logging authorization across 112 million acres of National Forests, and what appears to be the largest logging project in Colorado history, the “Lower North-South Vegetation Management” in Pike National Forest southwest of Denver — that’s because there’s no doubt that cutting forests keeps our homes from burning, right?
At least, that’s what you’ve been told by those carrying out or financially benefiting from “fuel reduction” logging on public lands. But the truth is the science is at best conflicted — at worst, shows such logging can increase the likelihood of homes burning — evidence many of these entities privately acknowledge but publicly deny.
Forest Fire Malfeasance, the new report from Eco-Integrity Alliance, uncovers how the unprecedented scale of cutting biodiverse, carbon-storing forests in Colorado is in part the result of an effort to mislead citizens, elected officials, and media through the bad-faith denial, misrepresentation, and dismissal of peer-reviewed science and community concerns while scientists and citizen advocates are publicly smeared and defamed as disreputable.
Hundreds of emails from a Colorado Open Records Act request show evidence of Jefferson County commissioners and Open Space staff working with 23 government officials, land management agencies, logging industry trade groups, a university, and other entities to push through thousands of acres of controversial “fuel reduction” logging in Colorado public forests.
One such email from federally-funded Colorado Forest Restoration Institute at Colorado State University to U.S. Forest Service’s Pike National Forest, and forwarded through Jefferson County Open Space, privately acknowledges that abundant science contests the efficacy of “wildfire fuel reduction,” and that the agencies “overpromise” results from such cutting, while advising to never admit this to the public or media.
A quote: “There are numerous studies demonstrating both effectiveness and lack of effectiveness of forest density reduction (‘forest thinning’) projects on altering fire behavior and effects. Engaging in toe-to-toe trench warfare with competing science papers would result in stalemate — and win for the opponents.”
Other emails show land management agencies and logging industry trade groups providing provably false information and defaming ecological advocates to reporters to (often successfully) convince outlets to not report on the story.
Sadly, the consequences of these policies are not simply harm to forest ecosystems, watersheds, wildlife populations including endangered species, carbon-storage, and recreational opportunities. Ironically, the outcome is a likely increase in community vulnerability to wildfire through widespread tree removal.
This practice dries out and heats up the forest microclimate and opens stands to wind, which can rapidly spread flames, potentially overwhelming evacuees and firefighters — while commandeering taxpayer dollars and attention away from the only actions scientifically proven to protect communities: home hardening and defensible space pruning up to 100 feet around structures.

,DC,2025-08-12 16:27:46+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump taps economist from far-right foundation to head agency that tracks jobs numbers,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-economist-far-right-foundation-head-agency-tracks-jobs-numbers,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump nominated conservative economist E.J. Antoni to fill the top spot at the Bureau of Labor Statistics after abruptly firing the previous statistician following a disappointing jobs report earlier this month.Trump announced the nominee late Monday on his Truth Social platform, stating that “Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.”Antoni, an economist at the far-right Heritage Foundation, has harshly criticized the previous BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden in 2023 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate 86-6 in January 2024. The bureau tracks national economic data, including employment figures.Without providing evidence, Trump slammed the latest jobs report, released Aug. 1, as “RIGGED” and fired McEntarfer hours later.The economy gained just 73,000 jobs in July, according to the monthly report. BLS also significantly adjusted May and June figures, to 33,000 for both months, down from the previously reported 291,000. Revisions to past reports often happen after the bureau receives updated data from businesses and federal agencies.U.S. economic data collection is often referred to as the “gold standard,” as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a Trump appointee, said last month.Trump faced backlash for firing McEntarfer, including from his own former BLS commissioner.William Beach, whom Trump tapped in 2017 to lead BLS, told CNN McEntarfer’s firing was “groundless.”BLS data is “more accurate now than they were 30 years ago,” Beach said during the Aug. 3 interview.In an Aug. 4 appearance on Steve Bannon’s WarRoom podcast, Antoni said BLS data collection is “outdated.”“You need somebody who is willing to overhaul the entire thing,” he told Bannon.Shortly after Trump’s November win, Antoni posted on X that “DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to BLS.”Kevin Roberts, Heritage Foundation’s president, said Tuesday that Trump made a “stellar choice” in nominating Antoni.""EJ Antoni is one of the sharpest economic minds in the nation—a fearless truth-teller who grasps that sound economics must serve the interests of American families, not globalist elites,” Roberts said in a statement. “His leadership as chief economist at The Heritage Foundation has been instrumental in advancing our mission to protect American families and rebuild a resilient economy rooted in free enterprise.”Antoni contributed to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a roughly 900-page far-right blueprint to overhaul government institutions published ahead of Trump’s election win.",,,,2025-08-12 12:59:06.304648

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)   A federal judge in Rhode Island has sided with a coalition of domestic violence support groups in momentarily barring the federal government from enforcing a newly imposed set of restraints on Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants.
Senior District Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued his 27-page ruling on Friday, Aug. 8, granting the preliminary stay requested by the plaintiffs — an assembly of 17 state-level coalitions who work with domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
The preliminary stay halts the Office on Violence Against Women, an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice which distributes the VAWA grants, from instituting conditions the agency was set to apply to grant applications starting Tuesday, Aug. 12. The funding policy change would require grant applicants to align their projects and services with President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging directives to discontinue federal funding of DEI and what the administration calls “gender ideology.”
“This order is a critical step toward protecting survivors and ensuring that communities across the country can continue to provide the services Congress mandated,” the plaintiffs said in a joint statement issued Friday. “The administration’s attempt to politicize essential funding that supports survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault was not just unlawful, it was cruel.”
The plaintiffs’ legal team included attorneys from Democracy Forward, the ACLU of Rhode Island, the National Women’s Law Center, the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, and Daniel Jacobson, a former counsel for the U.S. Office of Management and Budget during the Biden administration, and now head of Jacobson Lawyers Group.
Jacobson and Democracy Forward’s Kristen Bateman made their case during a July 29 hearing before Smith, arguing that the Office on Violence Against Women violated the Administrative Procedure Act by unlawfully instituting the new funding conditions.

The organizations who rely on these funds, the attorneys argued, would see their work imperiled if they had to forgo federal funding critical to their operations. Applicants also had to certify adherence with the new restrictions, which attorneys argued could trigger future federal prosecution under the False Claims Act.
Smith agreed in his ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on at least one of their Administrative Procedure Act claims. There was not enough evidence for the court to conclude whether or not the restrictions are fundamentally invalid, Smith wrote. But, the judge argued, administrative law is designed to provide clear reasoning for the actions taken by federal agencies — something absent in the office’s adoption of the new funding conditions.  
“The Court understands that this matter arises on an expedited basis, and perhaps a fuller administrative record will disclose more of the Office’s decisionmaking process,” Smith wrote. “But on the present record, the Court can only conclude that the Office engaged in a wholly under-reasoned and arbitrary process.”
Smith’s ruling returned several times to a court document he had discussed at the July 29 hearing: a declaration from Ginger Baran Lyons, the deputy director of the Office on Violence Against Women, that was filed on behalf of the federal government’s case. 
“The Office provides, as the only basis for its decision, a single declaration by an Office supervisory official,” Smith wrote. “While helpful, that declaration is not a substitute for an administrative record.”
During the hearing, Smith noted that Lyons’ declaration painted a vastly different landscape of how her office would interpret the new funding conditions, compared to the conditions’ actual language. Smith underlined that disconnect in his ruling, writing that the plaintiff groups would only find “cold comfort” in the agency’s reassurance that it would not treat survivors of violence differently than it has in the past.     
“In the context of this case and the present Administration,” Smith wrote, “the words of President Ronald Reagan have never rang more true: ‘The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the Government, and I’m here to help.’”
Smith was also unmoved by the feds’ arguments that the office “would be ‘unlikely to recover the grant funds once they are disbursed,’” and that “the public . . . has an interest in the judiciary respecting the Executive Branch’s ability to lawfully direct and guide agencies’ spending decisions.” 
The relief sought by the coalitions, Smith noted, did not require any disbursement of grant funds, just a shift in the conditions attached to them.  
“And speaking of respect,” Smith added, “the public has an interest in the Executive respecting the Legislature’s spending decisions.”

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) publishes “Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria: Review of Evidence and Best Practices,” a 409‑page report promoting “gender exploratory therapy.” The report’s nine authors are left anonymous in a move experts have called unusual. MIT philosophy professor Alex Byrne would later come forward as one of the authors, drawing criticism for his lack of medical expertise. Medical experts and advocacy groups criticize the review as biased, misleading and akin to conversion therapy.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) cuts more than $800 million in research grants meant to study the health of LGBTQ people. The cuts abandon studies of cancers and viruses and setback efforts to defeat a resurgence of sexually transmitted infections, according to an analysis of federal data by The New York Times. They also eliminate swaths of medical research on diseases that disproportionately afflict LGBTQ people.
In termination letters, the NIH justifies the cuts by telling scientists that their work “no longer effectuates agency priorities.” In some cases, they say the research had been “based on gender identity,” which gave rise to “unscientific” results that ignored “biological realities.”

Trump does not acknowledge Pride month. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says, “There are no plans for a proclamation for the month of June, but I can tell you this president is very proud to be a president for all Americans, regardless of race, religion or creed,” notably leaving out the LGBTQ community and never using the word “Pride.”

NIH staffers issue the Bethesda declaration, stating that the Trump administration has forced the NIH to “[politicize] research by halting high-quality, peer reviewed grants and contracts” as well as “[censor] critical research” on subjects including health disparities, health impacts of climate change and gender identity. The declaration has been signed by at least 484 staffers.
NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya would later push back, saying the cuts align with the president’s agenda. “Making America healthy again involves deprioritizing research that doesn’t have a chance of making America healthy, [such as] a lot of ideological research.”

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announces that the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline will shutter LGBTQ youth services on July 17, with the Trump administration saying the program promotes “radical gender ideology” without parental consent. In the announcement, SAMHSA notably drops the “T” in their references to the “LBG+” community.
The same day, a White House spokesperson attacks a federal judge’s ruling to block the Trump administration from disallowing transgender and intersex Americans to obtain passports aligned with their gender identity, calling it an attempt to “push radical gender ideology.” The judge rules that Trump’s executive order likely violates the Fifth Amendment as it discriminates on the basis of sex.
Reid Solomon-Lane, a transgender man and a plaintiff in Orr v. Trump, responds to the attacks: “I thought that 18 years after transitioning, I would be able to live my life in safety. … Now, as a married father of three … if my passport were to reflect a sex designation that is inconsistent with who I am, I would be forcibly outed every time I used [it] for travel or identification, causing potential harm to my safety and my family’s safety.”

State Department officials tell the Guardian that nearly $10 million in U.S.-funded contraceptives, purchased for now-defunct foreign aid programs, are set to be destroyed after being unable to find any “eligible buyers,” in part due to a gag rule reinstated and expanded by Trump that bans funding to overseas reproductive health, family planning and HIV-prevention programs as well as LGBTQ health initiatives. The contraceptives are currently being stored in a Belgian warehouse until their eventual demise, with the Washington Post reporting that, as of April, the stock included over 26 million condoms, millions of birth control packets, hundreds of thousands of contraceptive implants, nearly 2 million injectable contraceptive doses and more than 50,000 vials of HIV-prevention medication.
That same day, a federal judge issues a preliminary injunction against a law requiring clergy in Washington State to report child abuse disclosed during confession, finding the law likely violates the First Amendment by forcing priests to choose between their religious vows and civil obligations.

Newark’s Parking Advisory Committee is recommending a 15-minute courtesy parking option as part of its first set of proposals to City Council, a change members say could make quick trips downtown easier. 
The proposal, presented at the Aug. 11 council meeting, would allow drivers to park free for up to 15 minutes while still using the Passport app or kiosks, enabling the city to track use without processing small payments.
Committee Chair Rob Gifford stated that short-term transactions currently generate little net revenue once credit card processing fees are factored in. 
“It just barely covers our costs,” Gifford said. 
The city estimates the program would result in an annual net revenue loss of about $17,000, or 0.58% of current parking revenue.
“We’re not trying to give away free parking right off the bat or anything like that,” Gifford told council. “We’re taking a serious approach. 15 minutes is a nice amount of time where somebody won’t have any issues saying, ‘Oh, I was just two minutes over.’”
RELATED STORY: Newark to launch new outage management system for electric customers
The proposal would apply to both on-street and lot parking without reserving specific spaces. Gifford said the program could encourage more people to come downtown for quick errands, pickups, or deliveries. 
“Folks might find it as a positive thing — maybe they stay longer, or they feel like downtown is a great place to go,” he said.
Director of Planning and Development Renee Bensley praised the committee’s work, noting that members have taken a hands-on approach to problem-solving.
 “They recognize that there are issues with parking that they want to see corrected, but they come at it in both a collaborative spirit [and] a willingness to put boots to the ground and get the work done,” she said.
Other measures in the proposal include improving and standardizing downtown parking signage, monitoring lot usage with existing technology, and launching a new parking survey to better understand customer needs. The committee also intends to explore upgrades to the city’s parking app, develop a downtown parking marketing plan, and review the existing parking rate structure.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/elijah-mears-lZEvvh2HQcA-unsplash-scaled-e1755013410717-1024x654.jpg,,,2025-08-12 11:57:02.627857

“I’m running for U.S. Senate because the people of Alabama deserve a Senator who will always stand with Trump and defend our freedoms, our Christian values, and our constitutional rights,” Moore wrote in a Facebook post. “I was the first elected official in the country to endorse President Donald J. Trump back in 2015, and I will have his back and defend the MAGA agenda in the Senate, just like I have as a member of the Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives.”

A message seeking comment was left with Moore on Tuesday. The congressman is seeking the seat held by U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, who is running for governor.
Moore has positioned himself with the more conservative faction of the Republican Party. He is the sole member of Alabama’s delegation to belong to the House Freedom Caucus, often seen as the most right-leaning group within the House Republicans. Moore, like nearly every Alabama Republican, voted in 2021 to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, won by Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
Moore said in the video that if elected, his priorities are to “secure the border, to stop spending, defend our farmers and fight back against the Washington swamp.”
Moore served in the Alabama House of Representatives from 2010 to 2018. He entered the race to succeed outgoing U.S. Rep. Martha Roby, R-Montgomery, in what was then Alabama’s 2nd Congressional District in 2020. In a crowded and often bitter primary, Moore won the backing of the Washington D.C.-based Club for Growth and eventually the Republican nomination over Dothan business owner Jeff Coleman despite Coleman heavily outspending Moore, who went on to defeat Democratic nominee Phyllis Harvey-Hall that November.  
A new congressional map drawn in 2023 put Moore into a newly drawn 1st Congressional District, which takes in the Wiregrass, southern Alabama, Baldwin County and parts of Mobile County.
Moore challenged U.S. Rep. Jerry Carl, R-Mobile, the incumbent in the 1st district, for the party’s nomination in March 2024 and defeated Carl. Moore won the Wiregrass and Baldwin County while Carl took Mobile and Escambia County. Moore went on to defeat Democratic challenger Tom Holmes with 78.4% of the vote in the November general election.
Moore also made a point of distinguishing himself from other potential candidates in his announcement.
“I’m not one of those MAGA pretenders suddenly coming to be conservative,” he said. “I ain’t never been nothing but a Republican, and I stand up for our values and kind every day.”
Moore entered the race with about $250,000 cash-on-hand, according to the Federal Election Commission. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has also entered the Republican primary for the Senate seat.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Barry-Moore-Aug-4-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 11:57:02.627857

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the Palmetto State will apply for a waiver as well. But state officials are taking their time on the application to “do it right.” The process involves reviewing other states’ policies, he said.
“We don’t want any surprises,” McMaster told reporters Monday, adding the policy needs to be “specific and not leave any loose ends out there that would be confusing.”
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Responding to reporters Monday, McMaster said limiting what SNAP can purchase doesn’t stop people from making unhealthy choices.
“Anyone who wants to eat or drink whatever, they’ll still be able to do that if they want to. They just won’t be able to use taxpayer money to pay for it,” he said.
“Clearly, there’s a strong relationship between diet and health,” the governor continued. “I think we all realize that. That is the hallmark of our approach: common sense.”
Former Gov. Nikki Haley unsuccessfully sought a similar waiver from the Obama administration, saying food stamp restrictions could help fight obesity.
McMaster said opinions have changed since Haley’s effort failed more than a decade ago.
“There hadn’t been much support for this,” he said. “I think the public consensus has settled on ideas that there are things not particularly good for you and others that are. To the extent we can be reasonable about it and use common sense, it’d be a good idea to try to focus on that.”
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)North Carolinians can provide public comment on a natural gas pipeline at a hearing Tuesday evening, the latest step in the MVP Southgate project cutting through the state.
The Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources (DWR) is holding the hearing so members of the public can make their voices heard on Mountain Valley Pipeline’s LLC application for a 401 water quality certification.


Pipeline public hearing
The meeting will be held at Eden City Hall Council Chambers in Eden. Sign-in and speaker registration starts at 5:30 p.m., and the hearing begins at 6 p.m.
Members of the public can submit written comments by 5 p.m. on Sept. 12 by mail or through this link. Mail to Sue Homewood, 401 Permitting, 1617 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC, 27699-1617. More information is available here.


Running through Rockingham and Alamance counties, the pipeline has been controversial project for years. DEQ denied a water quality permit for the Southgate project in 2020, NC Newsline previously reported.
Out of roughly 150 comments received in advance of Tuesday’s hearing, only three were in favor of the project: one, a coalition of pipeliners, another an individual who is affiliated with the pipeliners union, and a third person who did not indicate their affiliation.
Hundreds of members of the Pipeliners Local Union 798 signed a letter backing the project.
“In addition to the tax revenue and job creation that MVP Southgate is poised to generate, this project’s approval is clearly in the region’s best interest, as it secures access to domestically sourced natural gas, safely and efficiently transporting it back to consumers that need it most,” Danny Hendrix, the union’s business manager, wrote in a supporting statement.
The union’s letter highlights the financial opportunities and jobs that could be created by the project.
MVP Southgate would invest $21 million into North Carolina’s economy and support more than 200 jobs in the state, according to the letter.
Hendrix also cited a rising need for natural gas in the region and said the project has “consistently demonstrated a commitment to environmental-sustainable goals” by adhering to feedback from members of the community.
“MVP Southgate is a central part of making a reliable supply of natural gas available for residents and small business owners in the region,” the letter continued.
The bulk of the submitted comments oppose the project, with some entries spanning dozens and even hundreds of pages.
Some came from organizations like the Southern Environmental Law Center or Wild Virginia. Others were submissions from individuals simply indicating  that they did not agree with the project.
Blakely Hildebrand, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, wrote the group’s opposition to the application.
She cited DWR’s denial of MVP’s original 401 water quality certification more than five years ago due to its “anticipated significant adverse impacts” to water quality in the state.
“MVP’s record of compliance with water quality laws and regulations in other states is abysmal,” Hildebrand wrote. “Virginia and West Virginia have issued dozens of notices of violation to MVP for its failure to project waterways in those states during construction of the MVP Mainline project.”
David Sligh, conservation director at Wild Virginia, focused on the proposed project’s impact to the environment in his letter on behalf of his group.
Pollutants from the project would enter Virginia since the Dan River flows downstream into the state from the project’s areas.
“While the direct discharges addressed in the application for MVP Southgate enter streams and wetlands in North Carolina, impacts from the project would affect Virginia waters and Wild Virginia’s interests,” he wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mountain-Valley-Pipeline-Photo-Ned-Oliver_Virginia-Mercury.jpg,,,2025-08-12 11:57:02.627857

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)A few months after Helen Hanks was ousted from the role amid scandal, Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced on Tuesday she is nominating William Hart to serve as the state’s next corrections commissioner.
Hart currently serves as a U.S. Marshal for New Hampshire. He was appointed to the Marshal Service by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate in June 2023. Prior to that he was Londonderry’s police chief and a county attorney for Rockingham County. He’s also a Marine Corps veteran and an alum of Merrimack College and Boston College Law School.
  William Hart
​​“Bill Hart has devoted his life to protecting the people of New Hampshire and strengthening our public safety system,” Ayotte said in a statement. “His decades of service reflect his commitment, integrity, and ability to lead with both strength and fairness. I am confident he will advance the Department of Corrections’ mission to enhance public safety and that he will bring the dedication, transparency, and expertise this critical role demands.”
The corrections commissioner is responsible for managing the state’s prison system. To assume the role, Hart will need to be confirmed by the state’s Executive Council.
Hanks resigned from the position in May. Court records filed allege she destroyed evidence in a murder investigation over a death inside one of the state’s prisons. At the same time, the department was facing major staffing issues; Hanks told the Bulletin last June that 47% of its positions were vacant and the department had incurred a $3.44 million deficit caused in large part by excessive overtime needed to cover the vacancies. Hanks had also spoken out after Republican lawmakers, seeking to cut costs amid a difficult fiscal environment, cut positions from the department, arguing these changes would create an unsafe environment in the state’s prisons. John Scippa, director of New Hampshire Police Standards and Training, has served as acting corrections commissioner since.
“I am honored to be nominated to serve as Commissioner of the Department of Corrections,” Hart said in a statement. “It has been my privilege to spend my career in service to the people of New Hampshire, and I look forward to working alongside the dedicated men and women of the Department to strengthen public safety, uphold the highest standards of professionalism, and advance our shared mission of rehabilitation and the security of all Granite Staters.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dochart-1024x721.jpeg,,,2025-08-12 11:57:02.627857

To read more about the project, click here.

I am a son of Jackson. My roots run deep – cultivated over Sunday dinners at my grandmother’s house in Presidential Hills, life lessons in my mother’s salon on Bailey Avenue, visits to Fire Station 21 where my father worked and childhood adventures in Richwood Estates.
Jackson has never just been a place to me. It’s memory, rhythm and resilience. It’s where I first learned that community isn’t theoretical. It’s lived out daily through perseverance and love. I’ve always loved this city. But like many with ambition and vision, I left.
After graduating from high school and briefly attending community college, I enrolled in Mississippi State’s Building Construction Science program. That experience changed my trajectory. Through design studios, collaborative projects and field visits to cities like Miami and New York, my perspective expanded. I began to see what was possible beyond the bounds of Mississippi.
After graduation, I followed opportunity to cities where innovation in construction was thriving. I joined teams in markets actively investing in infrastructure, encouraging creative solutions and supporting inclusive leadership. In those environments, I sharpened my technical abilities, broadened my worldview and grew both professionally and personally.
Still, Jackson was never far from my mind. I came back often – for birthdays, holidays or just to surprise my parents. With each visit, though, I saw more signs of decline –  crumbling streets, aging infrastructure, a growing sense of resignation. The energy I remembered – the drive, the optimism – was dimming. Jackson felt tired. And too many of its people had stopped believing.
My decision to leave wasn’t just about chasing ambition. It was about necessity. In Jackson, the professional landscape – especially in fields like construction and program management – offered limited pathways for innovation or growth. Entrepreneurial opportunities were hard to find and even harder to sustain. But what worried me more than the visible decay was the emotional toll: a creeping hopelessness that tomorrow might not be better than today.

Between 2012 and 2022, I worked across the country – New York, San Diego, D.C., Atlanta and Lawton, Oklahoma – managing construction and real estate development projects. Each city challenged me in new ways. I adapted to different cultures, built new friendships and navigated fast-paced environments. I met my wife in New York, married in 2019 in San Diego, and in 2021, we welcomed our daughter and launched my business in Atlanta.
By many measures, life was full and successful. But something was missing.
During an extended visit home during the pandemic, I found myself buried in Zoom meetings that started at 7:30 a.m. and didn’t end until well after 7:00 p.m. I was physically present, but mentally detached – consumed by work. Over evening conversations with my parents, something shifted. I began asking different questions. What’s the point of success if it’s experienced in a silo? What value does achievement hold if not shared with the people who shaped you?
I missed Sunday dinners. I missed HBCU tailgates and SEC game days. My parents were aging, and I could feel time speeding up. My wife and I began to think seriously about where we wanted to raise our daughter – not just physically, but spiritually and culturally. We wanted her to grow up surrounded by family, faith and familiarity.
In the fall of 2022, we returned home to Jackson.
Some say you can’t change a system from within. Others argue that real change only happens when you’re inside it. I believe both are true. And I’ve seen what happens when forgotten neighborhoods are met with vision, capital and collaboration. They transform. I’ve seen abandoned buildings become cultural anchors and neglected corridors reborn as centers of pride.
That’s what I want for Jackson.
I didn’t come back to fix everything. No one person can. But I returned with a strategic vision and a commitment to be part of something bigger than myself. Through my firm, Richardson & Richardson (RxR), I’m working to help Jackson confront its biggest challenges – blight, failing infrastructure and fragmented development – by facilitating public-private partnerships and empowering local talent.
My mission isn’t just to complete projects. It’s to restore belief in ourselves, in our neighborhoods and in what this city can become.
To my surprise, returning has been revitalizing. Jackson’s professional landscape is more alive than I expected – full of builders, creators and entrepreneurs with the courage to take risks. There’s a scrappy energy here, driven by the reality that we have to make our own way. But there’s also a closeness that large cities can’t replicate.
Here, my name matters. It opens doors in ways no LinkedIn connection ever could. Opportunities have a way of finding me based on my parents and grandparents’ decades old relationships. This is my village.
Yes, I left. But leaving gave me the tools, clarity and conviction to return with purpose.
This city raised me. Now, I want to help raise it.

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey received an eighth credit rating upgrade under Gov. Phil Murphy Monday, the outlook boosted by continued pension payments and a surplus that remains among the largest in state history despite recent reductions.
S&P Global Ratings raised New Jersey’s credit rating for New Jersey’s general obligation bonds from A to A+, citing the state’s full pension payments, $6.7 billion surplus, and local cybersecurity investments. This is the third credit upgrade it has given to New Jersey since 2022.
“The upgrade reflects our view of the meaningful improvement in the state’s balance sheet reflecting management’s commitment to rein in its comparatively large debt and pension liabilities while striving to achieve a structural budget balance longer-term,” the ratings agency said in a Monday release.
The news comes as Murphy’s two terms as governor wind to a close. Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office in January and is barred from seeking a third term in November.
Credit ratings reflect the risk of a given investment. Ratings rise as risk declines, and all else being equal, interest rates on bonds decrease, reducing the overall cost of borrowing for the state.
The increase S&P announced Monday is the eighth New Jersey has received since 2022 and only the 10th it’s seen since the 1960s, when it enjoyed AAA ratings from S&P and Moody’s Analytics. The state’s credit rating was downgraded 22 times between then and November 2020.
In its latest upgrade, S&P said the $7 billion-plus in annual pension payments and the $6.7 billion surplus approved in the state’s budget contributed to the ratings upgrade — but warned the scale of New Jersey’s longstanding pension obligations and other debts limit the chance of future ratings upgrades.
 Gov. Phil Murphy (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
“Although there is much more work to do by the next governor, I’m proud that we’ve done right by taxpayers by tackling longstanding fiscal challenges that stacked up over decades,” Murphy said in a statement.
New Jersey’s pension debts are likely to persist for decades. The state’s pensions are among the worst funded in the country after 25 years of underpayment that began under Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in the 1990s and continued under governors of both parties until the state made its first full pension payment about four years ago.
Only Illinois, where low pension contributions and fallout from the Great Recession have swollen unfunded pension obligations, has a more precarious pension.
New Jersey’s pension payments are expected to remain at around $7 billion annually until 2050, though some pension systems that offer retirement benefits to State Police, local and county police or fire personnel, and the judiciary will take longer to recover, according to disclosures from the Division of Pension and Benefits.
That timeline could forestall future credit upgrades from S&P.
“Upward rating potential is limited at this point but would follow material progress in further reducing its long-term debt, pension, and [other post-employment benefit] liabilities, while retaining structural budget balance and maintaining healthy reserves,” the ratings agency said.

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters. Kentucky health officials in June advised the public not to consume 7-OH or kratom products, warning that it posed the risk of liver toxicity, seizures, addiction and other detrimental effects. Last year, the legislature passed a bill prohibiting the sale of kratom to those under the age 21 and ordering the Kentucky Department for Public Health to regulate it
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.

This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.



Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.



“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states — including South Dakota — and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components, building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.

Gretchen Whitmer in the Executive Office in December 2022 | Andrew RothAfter more than seven months without representation in the Michigan Senate, several residents of Michigan’s 35th Senate District are taking legal action against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, in hopes of compelling  the governor to call a special election in the district. 
The suit, filed in the Michigan Court of Claims by Outside Law PLC on Sunday, was brought on behalf of seven residents from Saginaw, Midland and Bay counties. The complaint seeks a writ of mandamus from the court compelling the Democratic governor to initiate a special election for the open Senate seat.
The suit is also seeking a declaratory judgment that a failure to call the special election violates the Michigan Constitution, and an injunction requiring the scheduling of a special election at the earliest practicable time. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“This isn’t about politics; it’s about the Constitution and the Michigan Constitution isn’t optional,” Philip L. Ellison, the attorney for the plaintiffs said in a statement. “Every day this seat stays empty with no plan for fulfillment is another day 270,000 people are silenced in Lansing.”
Complaint
Michigan’s 35th Senate District was previously represented by U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City); however, the district has been left vacant since McDonald Rivet stepped down to serve in Congress, with the representative sworn into her new office on Jan. 3.
More than eight months later, the seat remains vacant as Whitmer draws criticism from several Republicans and some Democrats who are demanding the governor call a special election in the district. 
The district serves as a key battleground seat for the state Senate, and a special election could potentially shake up the chamber’s Democratic majority. While Democrats currently hold a 19-seat majority in the chamber, a Republican victory in the district would split the chamber.

Although Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, a Democrat and president of the Senate, could cast a tie-breaking vote, all members would need to be present and voting. If any member of the chamber is absent, a 19-18 vote would leave Gilchrist unable to vote, and any legislation would fail without the 20 votes needed to pass through the chamber. 
While Whitmer’s press secretary told the Advance they do not comment on pending litigation, Steve Liedel, an attorney with Dykema and former legal counsel to Gov. Jennifer Granholm, called the case a “frivolous lawsuit.”
“Since 1874 the Michigan Supreme Court has held that a mandamus action to compel the governor to perform some constitutional duty is not enforceable by the courts,” Liedel said, noting the ruling has been repeatedly affirmed over the decades, most recently in 2022. 
Liedel said he suspects there will be a motion to dismiss, most likely filed by the attorney general representing the governor, with the Court of Claims obligated to follow the precedent.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AMR0899-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 10:56:33.999591

Mike Braun talks to the Indiana Capital Chronicle during an event in Henry County on Tuesday, August 12, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun hasn’t yet decided if he’ll call a special session to redraw Indiana’s congressional map early — but said he and GOP legislative leaders are “considering it seriously” as they wait to see redistricting results out of Texas.
“It’ll be interesting to see what Texas does because they don’t have a supermajority, so … if that gets tripped up, it’s gonna probably impact what happens elsewhere, because the rest of it doesn’t add up to much,” he told the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday.
“I think mostly what happens here is going to depend on where Texas goes, because I think they’ve got five seats in play,” he said.
Indiana lawmakers redraw districts after each decennial census. They last did so in 2021. Congressional Republicans currently hold seven seats to Democrats’ two.
VP Vance meets with Indiana GOP leadership on redistricting; Democrats denounce effort

But President Donald Trump is pushing Texas and other GOP-led states to redistrict early to secure Republican majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives for the remainder of his second term. The midterm election is November 3, 2026.
Indiana is among the other states Trump’s administration has eyed, along with Florida, Ohio, Missouri, South Carolina and Nebraska, according to CNN.
Braun said he didn’t feel financial pressure from Trump’s administration to call a special session; the next regular legislative session is set to begin in January.
“I don’t think so. I think federal funding has maybe some discretion, and we’ve got an excellent relationship with the administration,” Braun said. “You see that when it comes to education, healthcare, energy, they’ve been in Indiana more than any other state, so I take that as the main dynamic at play.”
He harkened back to his days as a U.S. senator, adding, “I know how that game is played, and I think the relationship, regardless, will be good with the administration.”
Legislators will need to weigh in
Braun’s comments came days after Vice President JD Vance visited him and other Hoosier Republican leaders to discuss redistricting amid a large protest against such a move.
“We talked about several things, but that would have probably been the main topic,” Braun said. “And I think he left feeling like we were going to consider it seriously.”
He’s not just waiting on Texas, however — it’s also about the Statehouse’s dual Republican supermajorities and the two men who’d marshal their members through redistricting legislation.

House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate Pro Tem Rodric Bray have released statements that didn’t make clear their stance.
“Obviously that’s going to be something the Legislature has to see if they’ve got the appetite for,” Braun said. “Because as governor, you can call a session, and you can gavel in and out easily. (But) if it doesn’t have broad support, a governor’s veto doesn’t mean much either.”
“It’ll be up to our legislators to to see what they want to do,” he continued, adding that his  “eyes and ears (are) wide open” to his counterparts in the legislative branch.
Overtly partisan redistricting in Indiana would likely target 1st District U.S. Rep Frank Mrvan to the northwest. But it could also include 7th District U.S. Rep. André Carson, whose district includes much of heavily Democratic Indianapolis.
The national effort has found a prominent backer in Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, who wrote on X after Vance’s visit that he “fully support(s)” the redistricting effort.
Voting rights advocates have already vowed to challenge any Indiana redistricting efforts.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A coalition of school districts, a teachers union, the vice president of the Manchester NAACP, and an LGBTQ+ advocacy group are suing the state over a new law that seeks to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion policies from schools and local governments.
That law, which was added to the state’s two-year budget signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte in June, seeks to strip out DEI programs from public schools, public universities, and government entities, and includes financial penalties for school districts that don’t comply.
Supporters of the law, passed as part of House Bill 2, say it will remove policies that are discriminatory and will require school districts and governments to treat people by merit and not identity.
But plaintiffs in the lawsuit — filed in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, and attorneys from Drummond Woodsum & MacMahon — say the law is vague and unconstitutional, and would prevent schools from providing an “inclusive education.”
“Given HB 2’s vague and far-reaching scope in the education context, enforcers undoubtedly will arbitrarily decide when HB 2 applies and when it does not,” the lawsuit contends. “To the extent enforcers believe that any of this conduct is exempt from HB 2, this merely underscores the vague, irrational, and incomprehensible parameters of the law.”
The Department of Justice is likely to file a motion responding to this month’s lawsuit in the coming weeks. “We will review the complaint and will respond as appropriate in court,” a spokesman, Michael Garrity, said in a statement Friday.
The lawsuit echoes similar legal action in 2021 against the state’s so-called “divisive concepts law,” which barred public school teachers from advocating certain concepts about racial and gender disparities and oppression. That lawsuit led the U.S. District Court to strike down that law in May 2024, after the court agreed with plaintiffs that it was too vague for teachers to follow. The state has since appealed that decision to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral arguments in April.
What the new law does
The language in HB 2 seeks to prevent any diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at the state and local governmental levels.
Under the new law, no public entity may “implement, promote, or otherwise engage in” any DEI-related programs, trainings, or policies. That includes implicit bias training, DEI assessments, critical race theory, or race-based hiring or promotion.
The law defines DEI as “any program, policy, training, or initiative that classifies individuals based on a classification identified under RSA 354-A:1 for the purpose of achieving demographic outcomes, rather than treating individuals equally under the law.” Those classifications include age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, and national origin.
In addition to school districts, the law applies to municipal government departments, offices, boards, and subdivisions. It also applies to vendors. Local government entities are required to review their existing contracts “for the presence of DEI-related provisions,” a process that will be overseen by the state’s Department of Justice.
The law requires all public school districts to carry out a review of their vendor contracts by Sept. 30 and identify any DEI provisions, and it requires the Department of Education to monitor that review process and submit a report aggregating all school district contracts to the Legislature by Oct. 1.
And the potential consequences for school districts are steep.
“Should a public school fail to abide by any section of this subdivision, either knowingly or unknowingly, the commissioner of the department of education shall immediately halt all sources of public funding to that public school, until such time as the school comes into compliance with all sections of this subdivision,” the law states.
Debate over impact
For supporters of the new law, the anti-DEI prohibition is designed to make schools and state and local governments fairer to all. Rep. Jess Edwards, an Auburn Republican, likened DEI programs to affirmative action programs, and said eliminating them would require school districts to be more objective.
“Aren’t we supposed to be judged by the content of our character and not our skin?” Edwards said at a hearing in April in which the language was first added to the state budget.
But plaintiffs in this month’s lawsuit say the breadth of the DEI ban could affect programs the laws supporters do not intend to target.
For instance, plaintiffs argue, a school district could interpret the law to prevent them from creating sports teams specifically for girl; from making menstrual hygiene products available at no cost to female students; from teaching Holocaust classes that consider how intolerance and bigotry can be combatted; and from attempting to create greater access for Black and Latino students to comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
And the law could entangle special education plans under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, plaintiffs allege, because school districts might interpret the ban to prevent them from treating people with a “physical or mental disability” differently.
“These concepts are, at their core, about addressing the individualized needs of specific disabled people — namely, providing individualized services, accommodations, and supports that, by definition, are not provided to others,” the lawsuit states.
Those outcomes are not guaranteed, but they are possible given the vagueness of the new law and the challenge for school districts to interpret how to comply with it, the plaintiffs argued, especially with the risk of severe financial penalties if they are deemed to be noncompliant.
The plaintiffs also note that the law does not affect just public school districts or public colleges and universities. According to letters sent by the state Department of Education and cited in the lawsuit, any private school receiving public education freedom account dollars could be subject to the law, as well as any private college.
Charges of vagueness were at the heart of the 2021 lawsuit against the state “divisive concepts” law. In that case, attorneys for the state argued that the law, and subsequent guidance from the state Department of Justice to teachers, was not overly vague and that the lines of what should be allowed or not allowed in a classroom were clear.
In response to that lawsuit, some Republican state lawmakers proposed amending the “divisive concepts” law this year to clarify that it applies only when teachers “knowingly” teach concepts that are not allowed. Those bills, House Bill 50 and Senate Bill 100, both died after the House and Senate could not find agreement
The 2025 anti-DEI law does not include that limitation: It applies to situations where school districts allow DEI programs to continue “either knowingly or unknowingly.”
Other free speech challenges
The latest federal lawsuit dovetails slightly with another filed by the National Education Association in March, also in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire. That lawsuit challenges the U.S. Department of Education’s February “Dear Colleague” letter in which federal officials called on schools to eliminate DEI programs or face the denial of federal funding.
That threat has been paused since April, when Judge Landya McCafferty issued a preliminary injunction against any enforcement of the letter.
Plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm,” McCafferty wrote in her preliminary injunction order.  “Plaintiffs’ members are presently suffering First Amendment violations as a result of defendants’ coercion of educational institutions into censoring their members’ speech.”
Meanwhile, schools and state officials are waiting for the appeals court in Boston to rule on the state’s appeal of the order striking down the “divisive concepts” law.

Housing and real estate developers are beginning to feel the effects of President Trump’s taxes on imports – a move the administration claims will boost American-made products, but market experts say will hike already-elevated real estate production costs. Some are struggling to factor uncertain material costs into their current project plans.
The post Real[...]","MARCO AND DENIS LUZURIAGA’S restoration of an old meat-packing building in Holyoke will soon bring a new restaurant and coworking office space downtown – something officials say is vital for the city’s efforts to grow and revitalize. But the Trump administration’s new 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports – which went into effect in June after being raised from 25 percent – will undoubtedly add to their construction costs.  
Because their project is small, the brothers are luckier than most.  
“The little steel we still need to buy is going to be probably 50 percent more expensive, but we don’t need that much, so we’re talking an extra $5,000,” Marco Luzuriaga said. “If it was a huge building, it could completely stop the project.” 
Housing and real estate developers both big and small are beginning to feel the effects of President Trump’s taxes on imports – a move the administration claims will boost American-made products, but market experts say will hike already-elevated real estate production costs. But because federal tariff policies continue to change, some say the biggest challenge has been figuring out how to factor uncertain material costs into their current project plans.  
In Gateway Cities – where half of all renters spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent and housing production is already only half of what it needs to be to meet rising demand – increasing the cost of construction materials threatens an already tenuous housing market. High interest rates, land prices, and a shortage of construction workers have already strained developers’ budgets in recent years.  
Marco Luzuriaga, a local Holyoke resident and small-scale real estate developer, said many developers are still reeling from the pandemic, when nearly all construction costs increased. Material prices are still 40 percent higher than they were before the start of the pandemic, according to the Producer Price Index, a US Bureau of Labor Statistics program that tracks the change in selling prices domestic producers receive for their goods.

Tariffs are taxes on foreign goods and shipments. They are paid by importers, but the cost usually gets passed to consumers as manufacturers and sellers raise their prices to offset the levies. Massachusetts imports goods and materials from Canada more than any other country. (Last year, the state purchased $10.6 billion worth of goods from Canada.) Steel and iron are two of Massachusetts’ top imports from Canada, at $270 million annually.  
Canada is the largest importer of steel and aluminum to the US. Additionally, it supplies approximately 30 percent of the lumber used nationwide. Trump recently signed an executive order increasing the tariff on Canadian goods from 25 percent established in March to 35 percent – although the administration, for now, carved out an exception for most products under the new percentage, which went into effect this month. 
The National Association of Home Builders estimated in their March 2025 Housing Market Index that tariffs on lumber and other construction materials could raise the average cost of a home by $9,200. 
“How could this have gone up so much? And then I think, ‘oh, tariffs,’” Denis Luzuriaga said. “We’re noticing things going up by about 30 percent.”  
Cassandra Witthaus, associate director of real estate at The Neighborhood Developers (TND), a nonprofit affordable housing developer in Chelsea, Revere, and Everett, said due to the uncertainty around tariffs, it has been difficult to plan budgets for current housing projects. 
“We have had conversations about making sure that subcontractors are only including the known tariffs as of the date of our contract,” she said. “It has been challenging with the tariffs changing seemingly daily.”  
The tariffs may also negate a change to the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, which helps organizations like TND finance their projects, enacted through Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Before the bill was signed, the LIHTC program required that 50 percent of a developer’s land and building costs be financed by tax-exempt bonds. But the bill lowered that threshold to 25 percent.  
Like others, Witthaus said she expected this to help clear the LIHTC backlog created by the rising costs – which often make it difficult for developers to meet the 50-percent test – of housing production. But ever-changing tariffs are simultaneously increasing project expenses and making it hard to predict potential cost overruns. 
“They’ve had projects in the pipeline that they want to fund and they can’t, because the costs of the projects ahead of them have gone up so substantially that we have this backlog that’s created,” Witthaus said. 
“That automatically frees up the queue and allows projects to get moving, but those projects have to then be able to have state funding,” Witthaus said. “I think that things will start to speed up, but the things that are working against that are construction costs due to tariffs going up.”  
Other housing developers like Gordon Pulsifer – president of First Resource Development Company – are avoiding foreign imports, although American-made building materials are often more expensive.  
“We’ve been very focused on sourcing products in the United States now – not Canada, and not overseas,” Pulsifer said. “With construction costs on the rise, obviously tariffs don’t help.”

(Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, Food Research & Action Center SNAP deputy director


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

States have led the way in regulating kratom, and now federal officials want to ban 7-OH, a powerful compound found in some kratom products (Amanda Hernández/Stateline).For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements. The Missouri House advanced a bill that would enact new regulations on kratom products, but the legislation didn’t clear the Senate.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.
“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Etenia Kinard and Jacelyn Greenwell, who pleaded guilty to the charges, will be sentenced on Sept. 22. Sentencing for the defendants who went to trial was scheduled for Feb. 18, but was pushed back six months.

Life inside UNOI 
The group, which was deemed a cult by a federal judge in 2018, moved to Kansas City in 1996 to “create a heaven on earth for Black people to live and thrive in anticipation of the ultimate rapture,” court documents show. The group was spearheaded by Royall Jenkins — who claimed to be Allah, have the power to create natural disasters, decide if members would burn in hell, and marry multiple women.
UNOI operated in 12 states and had 3,000 to 4,000 members, according to court documents. Royall Jenkins and some defendants convinced members to give all of their possessions to UNOI — including their children.
Children were sent to Kansas City — often without warning and late at night, one former member told Kansas Reflector — to attend the “University of Islam,” where officials promised life skills and education. Instead, children were taught UNOI ideology and how to treat members of the “Royall Family,” to which most defendants belonged. At the trial, one victim testified they were taught that “women were not needed.” Multiple victims testified that it took years to catch up on education after leaving UNOI.
Members as young as 8 years old were forced to work up to 16-hour days at UNOI’s various businesses — with names like “Your Diner,” “Your Bakery,” or “Your Gas Station” — without pay, according to court documents. 
Some defendants instructed the children to tell suspicious customers they were doing an internship for school, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson wrote in an order that denied all defendants’ motions for acquittal or a new trial. 
Court documents said children were “rarely allowed to live with their families.” Victims at the trial testified that members were forced to live in crowded conditions and follow strict diets, and sometimes were denied permission to purchase items like underwear. 
In comparison, the defendants lived in nicer homes with their own families. Court documents show that Majeed, Rassoul, Hadley and Staton all had minor female members as live-in help for child care, cooking, and cleaning on top of their regular work duties. Although members had given up their vehicles upon entering UNOI, the defendants had access to transportation. Hadley drove a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
“Royall and his leadership, including Defendants, obtained the labor of minor children and adult members by creating a climate of fear and coercion,” Robinson wrote. 
On Friday nights, members would attend “math” class at the school from two to six hours. Children would be publicly humiliated and reprimanded for breaking UNOI rules — such as walking the wrong way down the street, weighing too much according to Royall Jenkins’ standards, or using the word “hi,” which Royall Jenkins said was connoted with hell. Their “disciplinary action” would be physical assault, with members of the group punching the subject in the chest in front of the auditorium. Court documents show that each defendant except for Peach spoke at “math” class. 
“The climate of fear was created by not only subjecting someone to discipline, but by subjecting others to witnessing or even hearing about the discipline of someone else,” Robinson wrote. 
At the trial, victims testified of beatings — with one testifying that Hadley and Daniel Aubrey Jenkins held him over train tracks. 
One testified at age 8 she was forced to fast for two days, and from ages 7 to 12 she was forced to receive twice-weekly colonics. 
Peach, who did not have any medical training, ran the “Kansas City Wellness Center” where these colonics were administered. Members needed permission to receive outside medical care and rarely received it. Instead, they would receive “treatments” from Peach. 
Court documents show that multiple members died because they were denied proper medical care. One of those members was Shaquanta Williams, a 14-year-old girl who had begged Royall Jenkins to allow her to go to the hospital. 
Royall Jenkins believed sickness was brought on by personal will, and ensured his members immortality. He said he could spiritually heal them. He died from complications of COVID-19.

While on trial, Majeed said that members of the board — including Majeed, Rassoul, and Staton — planned to shut down the organization after learning that Royall Jenkins had been using the funds for his lavish lifestyle and forcing his wives to have sex with one another. 
“We tried to do a stealth breakdown, remove everything, then have Royall find out,” Majeed testified. “Our attempt was to make sure this didn’t happen again. Period.”
But Majeed said there was nothing he could do to stop Royall Jenkins. 
“Going to the police would’ve stopped him,” said Maryam Zhuravitsky, an attorney with the Civil Rights Division’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit, during cross-examination.
Robinson found that each of the defendants’ roles were essential to maintain the forced labor. 
“This included but was not limited to Majeed’s leadership role as the second-in-command under Royall, directing UNOI officials in running its many businesses,” Robinson wrote in an order that denied the defendants new trials. 
Majeed, 51, faced a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
While all defendants faced charges of forced labor involving specific victims, Majeed was the only one charged beyond conspiracy. Majeed and Rassoul were the only defendants to testify at trial.
The victims testified that Majeed and Rassoul separated and isolated siblings and that he coached minors to lie about their age to Department of Labor investigators. 
Robinson wrote that “Rassoul’s role as the Supreme Minister, teaching UNOI adult and minor children the ideology and rules of UNOI and making dispatch decisions about minors” was essential to maintain the forced labor.
Rassoul, who at 39 is the youngest defendant, faced up to five years in prison.
“All the witnesses with knowledge of Yunus’ youth acknowledged their belief that Yunus had been brought into the cult at a very young age by his parents and had worked in the cult’s businesses (as a child, for free) just as they had,” wrote Tricia Bath, Rassoul’s attorney, in a court document. 
The government argued that when Rassoul became a member of the board he “was no longer youthful at age 26.” 
Robinson wrote that Rassoul was raised in UNOI. He married Royall Jenkins’ granddaughter and was adopted to the “Royall” family. 
Robinson found that “Staton’s role as the CFO, overseeing marketing, public relations, and being the primary leader of ‘math class’ where teachings were applied and discipline ordered,” made him essential to maintain the forced labor.
Staton, 63, faced up to five years in prison.
Robinson wrote that “Hadley’s role in developing and running the biodiesel lab, teaching at the University of Islam, and directly imposing discipline, including severe punishments such as beat downs” made him essential to maintain the forced labor. 
Hadley, 50, faced up to five years in prison.
Robinson wrote that Daniel Aubrey Jenkins’ role in “developing business and imposing severe discipline” made him essential to maintain the forced labor.
Daniel Aubrey Jenkins, 44, faced up to five years in prison.
Robinson found that “Peach’s role in developing and running the Wellness Centers and imposing discipline” made her essential to maintain the forced labor.

(John Cole/Capital-Star)Jonas Nissley is the third-generation of his family to lead Nissley Vineyards in Bainbridge, Lancaster County. His father and grandfather opened the winery in 1978. His grandfather also helped found the Pennsylvania Wine Association, serving as its first president.
“I think small wineries like ours and others are really economic and cultural anchors where we are,” said Jonas, who serves as Nissley’s president and general manager. “Many of us are in rural areas and so in a sense, we’re like a watering hole for people near us.”
Pennsylvania ranks fourth in the nation for wine production, up a notch since 2018. It has more than 400 wineries operating over 14,000 acres of vineyards and producing more than 2 million gallons of wine each year.
Nissley noted that Pennsylvania’s wine industry has been around for roughly 50 years.
“Keep in mind that the California wine industry has been producing wine and growing grapes for about 100 years,” Nissley said. “So, we’re a young industry.”
“And I think that in the short time, we’ve made a lot of strides to grow the industry and make it what it is,” he added.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A recent Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture study showed that the grape and wine industry supports more than 10,700 jobs, paying more than $518 million in wages, and directly contributing more than $1.7 billion to the state’s economy each year. The industry also draws millions of visitors annually, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars in tourism revenue.
However, Nissley sees dark clouds on the horizon.
“And that threat is out-of-state wineries who are coming in and are acquiring a limited winery license,” Nissley said. “That license was designed to support PA wineries and PA agriculture and wineries who are purchasing PA grapes and PA fruits to create authentic Pennsylvania wines.”
“We’re seeing this more and more over the past 15 years and we’re trying to create legislation to give those businesses an opportunity to operate,” he said. “But not reap the rewards that the PA wineries should be reaping for protecting PA agriculture and an authentic PA wine brand.”

Nissley isn’t the only one concerned.
Robert “Bob” Mazza is the founder and CEO of Mazza Vineyards in North East, a borough in Erie County. Established in 1972, it’s one of the state’s oldest wineries and by producing nearly 500,000 gallons of wine and juice, it is Pennsylvania’s largest limited winery.
Last year, Mazza’s The Perfect Rosé was one of only 20 U.S. wines to win a Gold Medal at the Decanter World Wine Awards, becoming the first and only Pennsylvania wine to earn the prestigious award.
But, he warned regulatory hurdles have been a roadblock for growth.
“We’re not fostering growth in the grape industry today with the way the regulations and the laws are being enforced, or lack thereof,” Mazza said.
Late last month, the state House Majority Policy Committee visited Nissley Vineyards for a tour and roundtable discussion about the most pressing issues facing the wine industry in the commonwealth.
Rep. Ryan Bizzarro (D-Erie), who serves as the chairman of the panel, told the Capital-Star he’s familiar with wineries in the state, noting that Erie County is home to several other large wineries, in addition to Mazza’s.
“It’s a huge industry. Agriculture is a big industry in Pennsylvania,” he said. “These wineries are drawing in people. They’re making money, and we’ve got to do everything we can to protect the integrity of Pennsylvania wineries and grapes.”
In 1968, the Limited Winery Act went into effect in Pennsylvania. The law permitted wineries to make up to 50,000 gallons of wine using fruit grown in Pennsylvania and allowed them to sell their wine directly to the public, hotels, restaurants, clubs, and the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB).
“The intent was very simple,” Mazza said. “It was to foster growth in the wine and grape industry in Pennsylvania.”
“And the reason I emphasize that is because that isn’t the case today,” he added. “So, that’s very, very critical.”
To acquire a limited winery license, according to the PLCB, an in-state or out-of-state winery has to produce less than 200,000 gallons per year of alcoholic ciders, wines, meads, wine coolers and fermented fruit beverages. Each operation may have up to five board-approved locations and up to two storage areas.
But Mazza points to a U.S. Supreme Court case, which led to what he calls “the wild, wild west” in their industry.
In 2005, the Granholm v Heald Supreme Court case ruled that laws in Michigan and New York restricting out-of-state wineries to make direct sales to consumers was unconstitutional.
“We have wineries that are being given limited winery licenses that are out of state and I dare say out of the country,” Mazza said. “They have no investment in Pennsylvania. They have no incentive to follow Pennsylvania rules and regulations and the Liquor Control Board can’t enforce anything.”
Out-of-state wineries also do not pay the assessment of 20 cents per gallon tax on wine sold to the Pennsylvania Wine Marketing and Research program that promotes the wine industry in the state. In contrast, in-state wineries that pay thousands of dollars a year into that marketing order.
That’s where the Pennsylvania General Assembly can intervene with legislation, they argue.

“We need to create multiple license classes, just like all the surrounding states,” Zach Waltz, director of Operations at Waltz Vineyards Estate Winery in Manheim, Lancaster County, told the Capital-Star.
This would differentiate in-state wineries from out-of-state wineries who don’t primarily use Pennsylvania grapes.
“New York. Maryland. New Jersey. They all have created these different license types to address the need for out-of-state and out-of-country wineries,” Waltz said.
In New York, for example, this distinction is made with out-of-state wineries who apply for a winery license, while in-state wineries, which are required to use 75% New York state grapes and other fruits for its wine and wine products, apply for a farm winery license.
WineAmerica is a national association that aims to improve the wine industry across the country, by improving federal legislation regulating winemaking, sales and distribution. Michael Kaiser, the organization’s executive vice president, told the Capital-Star that WineAmerica isn’t involved in state-related legislation like this but, “it seems like a natural progression for their state to want to institute a new law like that to give these in-state producers certain advantages.”
Zach Waltz said an enforcement division that takes it seriously would be key in helping these in-state wineries grow. He added that Act 39, which passed in 2016, promised PA wineries benefits that out-of-state wineries are currently taking advantage of, as well.
“Now, we have to also take care of these folks that, to a certain extent, have invested a few dollars in either retail locations or distribution centers, so there will be a place for that,” Mazza said. “It’s a different class, a different license that exists right now that they won’t have the limited winery license that Pennsylvania wineries should be offered and that’s very key.”
“They will not have the ability to self-distribute,” he added. “And that’s going to be the benefit that was awarded to the Pennsylvania wine industry with the Limited Winery Act and we need to bring that back.”
There are roughly 80 out-of-state wineries that have acquired a limited winery license, according to data provided to the Capital-Star by the PLCB. Just over half of those appear to be based in other states, while the rest are from out of the country.
Mazza said they hope to draft a bill, with the help of the executive director of the Liquor Control Board that can be supported by both Democrats and Republicans.
“Ultimately, this bill can be one of the most transformational things that we’ve done in our industry since the 1968 passage of the Limited Winery Act, which created this industry,” Mazza said.
They hope to have legislation drafted within the next 30 to 60 days.
“We heard loud and clear from winemakers about some of the issues they are facing,” said Rep. Manny Guzman (D-Berks), who serves as the chairman of the Central Pennsylvania House Delegation. “Winemakers are looking for legislation to support, promote and protect our homegrown wines and local businesses.”
“This should be a bipartisan piece of legislation,” Bizzarro said to the Capital-Star. “Most of these wineries are actually in Republican districts.”
“So, they have just as much skin in the game as we do and they should do whatever they can do to help preserve these wineries,” he added.

Climate change’s impact on winemaking
During the tour, Nissley noted that due to agriculture’s significant role with the winemaking process, climate change is something on their minds, especially with “climate events becoming more common.”
“You may wonder, ‘Well, how’s climate change affecting the PA grape industry?’” Nissley said to the group of lawmakers.
“In some ways, the warming climate benefits us because grapes like sunshine and dry. However, that is probably a smaller piece of the puzzle compared to the fact that we are getting more extreme events,” he said. “And it’s the extreme events that really take a toll on your vineyard.”
“But it is something that we’re concerned about,” Nissley added. 
Nissley isn’t alone.
Davide Creato, Vineyard Manager of Penns Woods Winery in Chester County, told PennsylvaniaWine.com that he might have to move his cover crop planting season in response to climate change.
“With less precipitation, the cover crop may need to be planted earlier than the spring,” he said. “If we have a dry year, they absorb too much from the soil, stressing the vineyard. With the dry weather pattern we’re seeing, we may have to start planting in the fall.”
Tariffs on the minds of PA wineries
Tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump’s administration have impacted a wide variety of industries across the nation, including the wine industry.
Waltz said that tariffs are definitely a part of the increasing cost of goods.
“It’s not as easy for us to buy everything within the United States,” he told the Capital-Star. “There are just certain products. For instance, corks are only made in Portugal. French oak barrels, which are a very fundamental part of our process, are only made in France.”
“And there is no other alternative in the United States for that,” he added.
Mazza said that he gets his glass from three primary sources: Canada, China, and Mexico.
“It doesn’t take a genius to figure out those are the ones that were targeted for tariffs,” he said.
The greatest impact, to him, was with tariffs on Canada, who he said retaliated against the beverages exported from the United States.
“And now those manufacturers that were exporting to Canada got a bunch of inventory back. And what are they going to do with it,” Mazza said. “They’re going to discount it, and they’re going to take shelf space away from smaller producers such as ourselves, because they’re going to discount those products in order to remove them.”
“That puts us at a disadvantage,” he added. “That was the immediate impact that we saw from the tariff situation. And there’ll be more to come.”
Federal immigration policies play a role in Pa.’s wine industry, too.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about 20% of the nation’s farmworkers are working through the H2-A program. The 378,000 positions certified by the U.S. Department of Labor for the H2-A program, Reuters reports, is three times more than the number of people working through this program in 2014.
The temporary agricultural program allows agricultural employers who are anticipating a shortage of domestic workers to bring nonimmigrant foreign workers to the U.S. to perform labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The temporary positions are not supposed to last longer than one year.
As the agriculture industry has become more reliant on the H2-A program, so has Pennsylvania’s wine industry.
Waltz said it’s been a big part of the vineyard management.

“For me personally, and I know for a lot of other wineries in the state, the H-2A program has been a lifesaver for us,” he told the Capital-Star. “When we were to the point where we could not get sufficient labor, that program saved us in that operation.”
“And not only saved us a sense of having labor, but it’s increased our efficiency,” he added. “It’s allowed us to expand and have that peace of mind that we know we will have that labor that when we need it.”
U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson (R-Centre) is the chair of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee. He told the Capital-Star in March that the program needs to be reformed because it currently does not help year-round agriculture needs and said one of the reforms could be making it work for year-round work.
Mazza mentioned that during Trump’s first term, his winery had a labor challenge. He said that Trump cancelled a lot of work visas and that forced one of the assistant wine makers, from the Mendoza region of Argentina, to go back.
However, noting how important this worker was for the organization, Mazza decided to keep the person on board in a remote consulting role.
“He’s back with us now,” Mazza told the Capital-Star. “He’s got a green card, and he’s working towards citizenship in this country.”
The Trump administration has directed U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) to conduct raids on farms in some states, which has resulted in sharp criticism from some Pennsylvania lawmakers and agricultural organizations.
It has not happened in Pennsylvania as of early August, but the concern remains among some in the agriculture and hospitality industry.
“We haven’t seen that in our area,” Mazza told the Capital-Star. “But that’s not to say it’s not going to come, and if it does, it’s going to hurt.”
“But I think just the fact that it’s being done in other areas is having an impact, already in the workforce in our area,” he added. “It has had an impact, I have friends that are in the restaurant industry, it’s had a definite impact on them that a lot of their labor force is not showing up to work, and they’ve gone elsewhere. They’re kind of in hiding, if you will, because they’re afraid of the possibilities.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nissley_wine_4_720.jpg,,,2025-08-12 09:56:09.796054

After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so. 


– ina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.
“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.

Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

The Democratic primary to replace late Rep. Melissa Hortman is Tuesday.
Voters in House District 34B, which covers parts of Brooklyn Park, Champlin and Coon Rapids, will decide which of three Democratic candidates will face Republican Ruth Bittner in the general election on Sept. 16.
Hortman, who served as House speaker from 2019 to 2024, and her husband, Mark, were killed two months ago in a political assassination.
Hortman first ran for office in 1998 and 2002 but didn’t win the former swing district until 2004. The district has since become strongly Democratic, with Hortman winning last year’s election by 26 percentage points. Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by 27 percentage points. 
Here’s how to find out if you live in the district. Minnesota has same-day voter registration, so if you live in the district, you just need to show up with a proof of residence. Acceptable forms can be found here.
The three Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidates running in the primary Tuesday are Xp Lee, Christian Eriksen and Erickson Saye.
Lee, the DFL-endorsed candidate, is a health equity strategist for the Minnesota Department of Health. He served on the Brooklyn Park City Council from 2022 to 2024.
Eriksen is also a Brooklyn Park City Council member — first elected in 2022 — and is a former chair of the city’s Human Rights Commission.
Saye is a Hennepin County prosecutor who worked as the lead DFL organizer in the 3rd Congressional District in 2018. Saye also worked in the Walz administration on constituent services and veteran affairs and served as the policy director of Minnesota Voice, a nonprofit focused on voter engagement.
Bittner, the sole Republican in the race, currently works as a real estate agent. She has never held public office, and she was formerly a food scientist.
There are three empty seats in the Minnesota Legislature following the resignation of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, and the death of Sen. Bruce Anderson, R-Buffalo.
DFL House Reps. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger and Ethan Cha are running as candidates to replace Mitchell. If one of them wins, Gov. Tim Walz will need to call yet another special election to fill the empty House seat.
Voters in the two Senate districts will go to the polls on Nov. 4 to replace the senators.

The resounding message of the administration? Free speech comes with a steep price.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jack Pitblado: The Trump administration’s attack on free speech is alive in Milton.","This commentary is by Jack Pitblado, of Burlington. He is the climate action coordinator for the Vermont Natural Resources Council.


When I started my new job at the Vermont Natural Resources Council this spring, I stepped into the middle of a legislative session unlike any other. President Donald Trump was hacking his way through our government institutions and slashing investments in climate and energy programs. 
We saw the trickle-down effects of these actions. In the weeks after Trump signed an executive order aimed at Vermont’s Climate Superfund Law, our opponents in the House and Senate called to repeal fundamental provisions of the Global Warming Solutions Act and to strip funding to implement the superfund. These are two backbone climate laws that put Vermont on a path to climate resilience and lay the groundwork to reduce fossil fuels and electrify our communities. 
To help fight against these attacks on critical climate policy, I urged Vermonters through countless calls and emails to reach out to their representatives and senators to ask that they vote against these proposed rollbacks. 
One of the people I spoke to was Henry Bonges, a resident of Milton, 10-year community volunteer on Milton’s Energy Committee and former Democratic candidate for state representative.

READ MORE

Bonges’ email to the Milton delegation, to which I was also a recipient, was not so different from most communications between legislators and concerned constituents. He asked them to support meaningful climate action and to embrace the scientific evidence that forebodes existential threats. 
In doing so, he appealed to his representatives to stand against this wave of attacks, and to think independently and clearly, unlike their peers in Congress and the White House. 
His appeal did not move his representatives into action. Instead, Bonges was ousted from his board and commission posts by the Milton Selectboard for speaking out.
Some of the members who voted him out happened to be on the receiving end of that email: Reps. Leland Morgan, R-Milton, and Brenda Steady, R-Milton. These two also co-sponsored H.518, the bill to repeal Vermont’s landmark Climate Superfund Law.
Bonges’s removal was a shock. But, when looking at it closely, it is clear that many Vermont elected officials are willing to follow Trump’s lead in pushing for major climate rollbacks. It was only a matter of time before our local leaders adopted Trump’s framework for shutting down the opposition.
Trump’s approach to handling dissent is relatively new (or perhaps resurgent) in American politics — shutting up the opposition. It is a simple three-step playbook: consecrate power into the hands of friends, bend the rules to your will and make your doubters pay.
He deployed Marines to tamp down protests on the streets of Los Angeles. He fired General Charles Q. Brown from his position as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in February for producing a video five years earlier that Trump deemed too focused on diversity. He has unlawfully detained Palestinian rights activists and pursued deportation for those who speak out.
The resounding message of the administration? Free speech comes with a steep price.
The parallels between Trump’s actions and those of the Milton Selectboard are clear.
I believe the Milton Selectboard has become a social club for the town’s Republican caucus, with Rep. Michael Morgan, Leland Morgan and Steady serving as members, and Rep. Chris Taylor, in a paid capacity as town manager after leaving the selectboard for the position in May.
With the state delegation taking a majority on the selectboard, decisions to hire and fire, commission and decommission are up to their majority votes.
Since power is so consolidated, the rules are subject to their administrators. There is nothing unethical about an engaged community member pleading to his representatives on how they should vote in Montpelier, even if Steady and Leland Morgan did not like his terse choice of words. 
There are, however, serious ethical concerns with local elected officials mixing their duties to be responsive to community input with their political apprehensions about the necessity of climate action — and personal disputes with a former Democratic legislative candidate in Milton.
They may disagree with Bonges, and that’s their prerogative. But disagreement doesn’t warrant retribution. Just because the president does it, doesn’t mean they should.
The primary consequence of Bonges’ removal is intimidation.
So many of the most politically active members of our communities serve on several town boards and commissions. They truly care about their neighbors and they want to live out their values, not just pay lip service to them. 
Removing a committed public servant for his views only sends a message to others that they should get in line or get out. It’s undemocratic and unacceptable.
This kind of vindictive behavior is not fitting for the peoples’ representatives. For the sake of Milton, I hope all residents concerned with the state of our democracy and freedom of speech speak up for Henry to be reinstated to his posts.

For consumers who want their personal data scrubbed from data brokering companies, removing your information isn’t always clear cut — despite a state law that aims to assist with just that.
As CalMatters and The Markup’s Colin Lecher and Tomas Apodaca explain, California requires companies that make most of their money from selling consumer data to provide customers a way to request their data be deleted.
But among the state’s most recent database of nearly 500 data brokers, Colin and Tomas found that 35 companies had code that hid their deletion instructions from showing up in Google searches.
Telesign, for example, which advertises fraud-prevention services for businesses, buried the link to its “Data Deletion” and “Opt Out / Do Not Sell” form about 7,000 words deep into its legalese-ridden privacy policy. This form is also hidden from search engines and isn’t linked on its homepage. 
To help Californians protect their privacy, lawmakers in 2023 passed the Delete Act, which established the creation of the “Delete Request and Opt-out Platform.” Beginning 2026, DROP will enable consumers to send a single request to data brokers on the registry for their data to be deleted.

Speaking of tech: Last week Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a partnership between some of the tech industry’s top companies and California’s community college system. 
As artificial intelligence usage proliferates, AI training has become vital to remain competitive in the tech job market.

CA may be on the hook for PG&E loan

To keep California’s last nuclear power plant running, the Newsom administration in 2022 successfully requested a $1.4 billion loan from the Legislature in 2022. But while lawmakers expected a federal award to fully cover the loan down the road, an analysis by CalMatters’ Malena Carollo found that nearly half may not get repaid.
Diablo Canyon is run by Pacific Gas and Electric and provides roughly 8% of the state’s total energy. Though it was slated to shut down this year due to economic reasons, state regulators voted to extend its operations until 2030.
While seeking approval for the loan, Newsom’s administration said a federal program from the U.S. Department of Energy would pay for the loan. But by law, the department could only award $1.2 billion each cycle, and PG&E applied for a $1.1 billion loan that was shy of that maximum. The utility company is also unlikely to use profits from the plant to make up the difference, since PG&E said it expects its costs for the plant to exceed the loan.

CA congressmember faces constituents’ wrath

Leaders in the GOP in recent months have been discouraging Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives from hosting face-to-face forums after a series of town hall confrontations went viral earlier this year. But Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents parts of California’s rural north, held one anyway — and it was about as raucous as one would expect.
More than 650 people attended LaMalfa’s town hall in Chico on Monday, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller. For nearly 90 minutes, the crowd interjected, booed and jeered the congressmember, slamming LaMalfa’s vote for President Donald Trump’s budget bill. The budget guts Medicaid spending by more than $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years, a move that will harm rural hospitals and people, the crowd said.
During the event, Navy veteran Ryan Rogoski told LaMalfa that he must drive three hours round-trip to see a therapist for PTSD due to the lack of mental health providers in the Chico area. Though LaMalfa acknowledged that Rogoski’s situation was unacceptable, LaMalfa blamed local Chico VA leadership for mismanagement.
Rogoski left the meeting in tears, and later told CalMatters that LaMalfa’s answer was “extremely false.”

And lastly: CA’s less talkative lawmakers 🤫

The average California legislator has talked for more than six hours since the beginning of the legislative session. But eight lawmakers stand out for being far quieter than the rest. Find out who they are from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow and Omar Rashad.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Newsom’s proposal to redraw California’s congressional maps faces an uphill battle that could include opposition campaigns, legal battles and intervention by Trump’s U.S. Department of Justice.

Others have said comparatively little. How effective can you be if you stay silent?,"In summary
California lawmakers have spoken on average for more than six hours this year. Others have said comparatively little. How effective can you be if you stay silent?


Most California lawmakers love to talk, but some hardly say a word. 
Since the legislative session began in December, the average lawmaker has spoken for 6.3 hours. But eight lawmakers have talked for around an hour or less – six of them Republicans, who are a superminority in the Legislature, according to a CalMatters Digital Democracy analysis.
Quiet Republicans include a trio of assemblymembers from Orange County and a north state senator. Two other quiet Republicans represent competitive Assembly swing districts in the Inland Empire. A pair of Democratic assemblymembers – one from the San Joaquin Valley, the other representing the Chino area – also have been keeping their thoughts mostly to themselves this year.
“I don’t waste time on performative politics,” Orange County Republican Kate Sanchez said in an emailed statement. “If more of my colleagues did the same, we would have significantly more productive conversations at the Capitol.”
Sanchez spoke for just over an hour so far this year. Many of her remarks were on her short-lived bill that sought to prevent transgender students from participating on a girls interscholastic sports team.
The striking differences in speaking are found in the CalMatters Digital Democracy database, which tracks every word spoken during public hearings in the California Legislature. 
But does talking equal effectiveness? Not necessarily.
A Digital Democracy analysis found no link between speaking time and whether a lawmaker’s bills got signed into law during the last two-year session.
That doesn’t surprise Thad Kousser, a former legislative staffer and political science professor at UC San Diego.
“That kid who always has his hands up in class may not always be the one everyone listens to,” Kousser said. 
Does talking make lawmakers effective?
Instead, success seems mostly to be about the types of bills lawmakers introduce rather than how much they talk about them. Lawmakers from both parties who regularly author controversial legislation are less likely to see theirs pass, regardless of how much they talk about them. 
Personalities and relationships with colleagues matter, too.One example: Bill Essayli, a firebrand Republican representing the Corona area, often spoke critically of Democrats in speeches that made him the eighth-most talkative among the 26 Republicans last session. 
None of his bills passed. Like his fiery floor speeches, many of Essayli’s bills were intended to score points with his Republican base. Democrats who control the Legislature killed them out of spite, even the few that weren’t particularly controversial.
By comparison, Sen. Megan Dahle, representing the Redding area, had the highest bill success among Republicans, despite being the third-quietest member of the Legislature last session.
Members of both parties like Dahle personally. Her bills also tend not to be particularly controversial. They typically focus on local issues important to her constituents.

But that doesn’t mean speaking isn’t an important political consideration for lawmakers, Kousser said.
“No legislator is convinced to vote ‘yes’ on a bill because of a floor speech,” he said. “A floor speech doesn’t change people’s minds about a bill; it changes people’s minds about a legislator. Who is this person? What do they stand for?” 
Case in point: Democrats may have killed all of Essayli’s bills, but his speeches critical of Democrats made for a steady stream of social media and news clips that caught the attention of those in President Donald Trump’s orbit. This spring, Essayli quit the Legislature after Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, made Essayli the interim U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles.
Fresno’s quiet lawmaker says he’s effective 
Fresno Democratic Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula has spoken for 55 minutes so far this year and has been significantly quieter than he was last session.
But he challenged whether his speaking rate was an accurate reflection of his involvement and impact in the Legislature. 
“The original number of words spoken means very little to me as I think you can get more across in fewer words and be just as effective as those who speak more,” Arambula said in an interview with CalMatters’ reporting partner, Fresnoland. “So I don’t put any weight or validity toward that number at all.”
Arambula said he has avoided not becoming less engaged in the Legislature after Speaker Robert Rivas removed him from the Assembly’s health committee. Arambula had discussed challenging Rivas for the leadership seat. Arambula, an emergency room doctor, has filed to run for a Fresno City Council seat in 2026.

Arambula said speaking is less important than what lawmakers do for their communities. 
“I have a responsibility to make sure that our community is represented well,” Arambula said. “I believe you do that most effectively by returning resources.”
Arambula said he played a key role, despite a tough budget year, in Gov. Gavin Newsom including $100 million for infrastructure in Fresno’s downtown and Chinatown as part of a $300 million commitment. Newsom paused state funding for the city’s infrastructure last year.
“No one else was able to return resources for their community like we were,” Arambula said. 
Quiet lawmakers unavailable for interviews
Perhaps not surprisingly, the other quiet lawmakers either didn’t respond to interview requests, or their spokespeople replied with emailed statements.
Republican Assemblymember Greg Wallis, who won his Inland Empire Assembly seat in 2022 by one of the smallest margins in state history, has largely stayed silent on the dais since. So far this year, he’s talked for 38 minutes. 
“I love the irony of chasing the quiet Assemblymembers for an interview,” Wallis spokesperson Colin Hawley said in an email. “Greg is all about consistency, so in this instance, he’s choosing to keep his words few and let his votes do the talking.”
The most silent by far is Sen. Dahle. She talked for just seven minutes so far this year. Never particularly chatty on the dais to begin with, Dahle had a stroke in late 2023. It’s now difficult for her to form words, so she mostly stays quiet.
After taking time off to recover, Dahle gave a brief floor speech last August while still a member of the Assembly.
“Speaking’s hard, but I’m doing it,” she said, while fighting back tears. 
This year, much of the seven minutes Dahle spoke were on the Senate floor during another emotional speech supporting a stroke resolution.
In an emailed statement, Dahle said she has “that much more time to listen and to discern what is good for my north state constituents and what is not” when she’s not speaking in hearings.
She said she is still fighting on issues such as wolf attacks on livestock, illegal marijuana growing and the state’s rural water supply.

Democratic Assemblymember Michelle Rodriguez, elected last year to represent the Chino area, spoke for only 34 minutes. A spokesperson said she was too busy for a phone interview last week while the session is on summer recess. 
A spokesperson for Assemblymember Leticia Castillo, a Corona-area Republican who has talked for 52 minutes since narrowly winning her Assembly seat last year, didn’t return messages.
Spokespeople for Orange County Republicans Tri Ta, who spoke for 65 minutes, and Phillip Chen who spoke for 28, also didn’t return interview requests.
Former Stockton-area Democratic Sen. Susan Talamantes Eggman, who termed out of the Legislature last year, said some of the most persuasive lawmakers are those who provide thoughtful commentary at the right moment instead of blabbing all the time.
“If you’re just talking to have words, quickly you’re going to get eye rolls, and people drift away,” she said. “People don’t listen if you’re just talking.”

Some companies are making it extra difficult,Colin Lecher and Tomas Apodaca,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/08/companies-make-it-hard-to-delete-personal-data/,The Markup and CalMatters found dozens of sites preventing their legally required opt-out pages from being indexed.,"In summary
The Markup and CalMatters found dozens of sites preventing their legally required opt-out pages from being indexed.


Data brokers are required by California law to provide ways for consumers to request their data be deleted. But good luck finding them.
More than 30 of the companies, which collect and sell consumers’ personal information, hid their deletion instructions from Google, according to a review by The Markup and CalMatters of hundreds of broker websites. This creates one more obstacle for consumers who want to delete their data. 
Many of the pages containing the instructions, listed in an official state registry, use code to tell search engines to remove the page entirely from search results. Popular tools like Google and Bing respect the code by excluding pages when responding to users.
Data brokers nationwide must register in California under the state’s Consumer Privacy Act, which allows Californians to request that their information be removed, that it not be sold, or that they get access to it. 
After reviewing the websites of all 499 data brokers registered with the state, we found 35 had code to stop certain pages from showing up in searches.
While those companies might be fulfilling the letter of the law by providing a page consumers can use to delete their data, it means little if those consumers can’t find the page, according to Matthew Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports who studies the California law governing data brokers and other privacy issues. 
“This sounds to me like a clever work around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it,” Schwartz said.
After The Markup and CalMatters contacted the data brokers, seven said they would review the code on their websites or remove it entirely, and another two said they had independently deleted the code before being contacted. The Markup and CalMatters confirmed eight of the nine companies removed the code. 
Two companies said they added the code intentionally to avoid spam at the recommendation of experts and would not change it. The other 24 companies didn’t respond to a request for comment; however, three removed the code after The Markup and CalMatters contacted them. 
(See the data on our GitHub repo.)
“This sounds to me like a clever work around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it.”Matthew Schwartz, policy analyst, Consumer Reports
Most of the companies that did respond said they were unaware the code was on their pages. 
“The presence of the [code] on our opt-out page was indeed an oversight and not intentional,” May Haddad, a spokesperson for data company FourthWall, said in an emailed response. “Our team promptly rectified the issue upon being informed. As a standard practice, all critical pages—including opt-out and privacy pages—are intended to be indexed by default to ensure maximum visibility and accessibility.” The Markup and CalMatters confirmed that the code had been removed as of July 31.
Some companies that hid their privacy instructions from search engines included a small link at the bottom of their homepage. Accessing it often required scrolling multiple screens, dismissing pop-ups for cookie permissions and newsletter sign-ups and then finding a link that was a fraction the size of other text on the page. 
So consumers still faced a serious hurdle when trying to get their information deleted.
Take the simple opt-out form for ipapi, a service offered by Kloudend, Inc that finds the physical locations of internet visitors based on their IP addresses. People can go to the company’s website to request that the company “Do Not Sell” their personal data or to invoke their “Right to Delete” it — but they would have had trouble finding the form, since it contained code excluding it from search results. A spokesperson for Kloudend described the code as an “oversight” and said the page had been changed to be visible to search engines; The Markup and CalMatters confirmed that the code had been removed as of July 31.
Telesign, a company that advertises fraud-prevention services for businesses, offers a simple form for “Data Deletion” and “Opt Out / Do Not Sell”. But that form is hidden from search engines and other automated systems, and isn’t linked on its homepage. 
Instead, consumers must search about 7,000 words into a privacy policy filled with legalese to find a link to the page. 
A spokesperson for Telesign didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Five of the pages listed in the California registry not only aren’t indexed for search, but don’t exist. For example, a company called BrightCheck, which offers “AI-driven identity verification,” lists a privacy instructions page on the California registry. But when The Markup and CalMatters visited the page in late July, we found a notice that the page no longer exists. The page was there on March 18 when The Markup and CalMatters first scanned the site, and the Wayback Machine has an archive of the page from February 14. 
BrightCheck didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The California Consumer Privacy Act went into effect in 2020, governing companies that make most of their revenue from selling consumer data, or who make more than $25 million per year or handle the data of more than 100,000 people in the state. With no comprehensive federal privacy law, the law is among the few regulations data brokers must comply with. 
California’s most recent broker database lists nearly 500 companies, most of which consumers have likely never heard of. They include businesses with zippy start-up names like StatSocial and UpLead, and offer everything from email marketing tools to contact directories. CalMatters last year published a guide with information on how consumers can exercise their rights using the database or third-party tools and on how they can request deletion of their children’ s information.
Tom Kemp, executive director of the entity tasked with enforcing the privacy law, the California Privacy Protection Agency, said in an interview that the agency had reproduced The Markup and CalMatters’ findings. While he declined to comment on any particular company’s practices, he pointed to an enforcement advisory from the agency on “dark patterns,” which are design choices that have “the substantial effect of subverting or impairing a consumer’s autonomy, decisionmaking, or choice.”
If a company makes it much more difficult to choose to remove their personal data than to contribute it, or includes excessive jargon or other hurdles for consumers to jump through to remove it, according to the advisory, they might be violating the law.
This year, the privacy agency has taken enforcement action against companies including Todd Snyder and Honda for, among other violations, making it too difficult to choose to not have their data used. Todd Snyder paid a nearly $350,000 fine this year, while Honda agreed to pay more than $630,000. Both agreed to overhaul their privacy practices.
Kemp said that, when determining whether a company has violated the privacy act, it’s important to determine whether there’s a pattern of activity making it difficult for consumers to exercise their rights. Hiding a privacy instructions page could be the first “thread” in determining whether a company is shirking their obligations. 
In the past, other companies have been criticized for hiding important web pages from search engines. In 2019, ProPublica revealed how the company behind tax filing service TurboTax added code to effectively hide an option for users to file their taxes for free. A 2021 report from the Wall Street Journal found that hospitals were hiding prices they were required to post under federal transparency rules. 
Recognizing that most Californians have never heard of the hundreds of companies in the data broker registry, lawmakers in California recently passed the Delete Act. The law will create a system called the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, or DROP, which will allow consumers in California to send a single, legally binding request to all data brokers on the registry at one time. The privacy protection agency intends to launch it next year.

Adela de la Torre
Adela de la Torre is president of San Diego State University, which last week launched a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) training facility in Imperial County.


Welcome to California’s “Lithium Valley,” where infighting, hyper-regulation and litigation run as deep as the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium sitting beneath the arid landscape. Here, collective dysfunction may prevent a state in financial difficulty from seizing an opportunity potentially worth more than half a trillion dollars. 
What began as a generational opportunity for the region’s economy and for America’s green energy independence has turned into a stalled quagmire of empty promises, paralyzing self-interests and unfulfilled progress. 
Today the many players involved — environmental activists, community groups, elected representatives and private enterprises — stand at a crossroads. They can continue down the divergent paths that have yielded nothing, arguing over regulation, or they can come together and share in the rich economic and environmental rewards offered by this buried treasure. 
Lithium is a vital component in renewable energy technology, and we have long known that there is a rich deposit underground near the Salton Sea. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy said Lithium Valley was “powering our clean energy transition,” while Gov. Gavin Newsom called the area “the Saudi Arabia of lithium” and made it an important part of that year’s budget. 
Only in late 2023 did researchers discover the true scope and magnitude of the deposit. Soaring new estimates said there were 18 million metric tons of lithium available, or enough to produce over 375 million electric vehicle batteries, worth an estimated $540 billion.
It is a massive opportunity to boost renewable energy and enhance energy independence for a nation that has had to import as much as three-quarters of our lithium in recent years. And it is an economic opportunity to invigorate Imperial County, where 17% of people live in poverty and 17% are unemployed, more than triple the state average. 
Sadly though, Lithium Valley has thus far generated more unfulfilled plans and lawsuits than EV batteries. 
California’s latest economic blueprint calls out critical minerals as an economic sector the state will “bet” on, and it has already invested well over $100 million. Yet businesses that committed to the effort are reconsidering their plans as progress stagnates. The industry’s attention and resources are being redirected to smaller lithium deposits in more progress-friendly states, including Nevada, Texas, Arizona and Arkansas.
This month, San Diego State University opened a new, state-funded $80 million STEM facility to provide training that will empower the people of Imperial County to reap the benefits of the “white gold” in their backyard. But unless progress in Lithium Valley accelerates rapidly, these students will graduate into an empty local job market.
Each new lawsuit, policy and delay pushes the realization of Lithium Valley’s promise further over the horizon. As we are already seeing, the ramp-up process can take years, during which customers will solidify their supply chains in other regions, and it will become even harder and more expensive for us to compete. Costs will continue to rise and a 10% tax credit for companies that extract, refine and recycle critical minerals like lithium will be gone by 2034.
Lithium Valley could prove that California really is open for business, and that sustainability and environmental stewardship can actually coexist with job growth and prosperity. It could be a national model for efficient, sustainable and locally driven development.
Clean energy, national security and local and statewide prosperity are at our fingertips. But that vision will slip away if the many players involved cannot harness these collective interests, commit to collaborate and prove our ability to succeed.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/020423-Geothermal-Lithium-AD-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

But it also increases a federal tax credit that helps build affordable housing in California.","In summary
Trump’s spending bill includes cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and more. But it also increases a federal tax credit that helps build affordable housing in California.


California lawmakers are preparing for a historic surge in federal funding for affordable housing construction, a tsunami of subsidy that advocates say could as much as double the number of low-rent units produced by the state over the next decade.
It comes from an unlikely source.
Buried deep among the cuts to social services in President Donald Trump’s signature spending package, the One Big Beautiful Bill, is an increase in support for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit that affordable housing advocates have sought for years. Those tax credits are the most important federal funding available for affordable housing, and they’re used in low-income projects throughout California. 
Exactly how much difference this boost will make in the Golden State depends on many factors, including tariffs, labor costs, state funding, and more. But experts agree the change could help California build thousands more affordable homes each year. 
“It’s a very big deal,” said Matt Schwartz, president and CEO of the affordable housing nonprofit California Housing Partnership. “These provisions are a huge shot in the arm for an affordable housing field that has been suffering under exhausted state resources.”
It’s no wonder those provisions haven’t gotten much public attention. The federal law, which Trump signed on July 4, extends and expands tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the richest and adds trillions to the federal debt while imposing historic spending cuts to Medicaid, other patches of the social safety net and clean energy programs over the next decade. For California’s Democratic leadership and its liberal-leaning electorate, there isn’t much to love and plenty to hate.
“From a California perspective, there have certainly been a lot of concerns with that bill,” said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, which advocates for affordable housing development. 
But the spending package gives affordable housing boosters something to celebrate, even if many in blue California are reluctant to do so publicly. 
Because the expansion to the tax credit program, part of a preexisting bill, was folded into the broader package, “the federal government has given us a green light to double production,” said Pearl. 
Last week, the state committee that oversees these credits approved changes to its application process that incentivize developers to take advantage of the new federal policy.
What exactly do tax credits have to do with affordable housing? 
“It’s a very big deal.”Matt Schwartz, President and CEO, California Housing Partnership
Rather than fund public housing construction directly like it used to, the federal government rerouted most of its affordable housing funds through the tax code beginning in the 1980s. These tax credits are issued by states to affordable developers, who then sell them on to deep-pocketed banks, insurance companies and other financial behemoths, trading tax cuts for ownership shares in affordable housing projects.  
It’s a financial Rube Goldberg machine, and it’s everywhere. If there’s an apartment project designated for unhoused people or low-income tenants in your neighborhood, chances are tax credits helped get it off the ground. 
The credits come in two basic flavors. Both are getting a major boost under the new federal law.
One credit lets its owners write roughly 9% of the cost of construction on a project off their tax bill each year for 10 years. Those 9% credits are doled out by the federal government to the states, who then turn around and award them to developers. There are always more qualifying projects than there are credits to fund them, especially in California. The Trump-backed spending package boosts the total number of these credits by 12% each year indefinitely. 
The other type of credit, the 4% credit, doesn’t come with a cap, which means it is technically available to any developer who qualifies. How a developer qualifies is the rub. Historically, an affordable project needs to cover half of its costs with particular tax-exempt bonds — which, like the 9% credits, are in short supply — to make full use of the 4% credits. The federal bill reduces that requirement, so that a project only needs to cover a quarter of its cost with the bonds. 
“The bottom line is the federal government is making additional tax credits and bond capacity available,” Pearl said, “which is one of the biggest things you need to produce affordable housing nationwide, and especially in California.”
The state receives more requests for bond financing each year than it can grant, said Marina Wiant, executive director of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. Her committee last week voted to change its application to line up with the new federal requirements — reducing the percentage of a new project that must be financed via bonds, and allowing projects already approved to reduce their bond financing. That lower threshold means there will be more bond money to go around, and more projects will get funded, she said. 
“There are a lot of projects still in the queue that are waiting for bond financing,” Wiant said. “So this immediate change will have a pretty immediate impact this fall.”
How did this affordable housing boost get into Trump’s spending plan in the first place?
Schwartz’s group and others have been fighting for this tax credit increase for years, garnering bipartisan support along the way, he said. Republican lawmakers tend to view tax credits as a “good kind of subsidy,” he said. Because they are used by corporations, they are more palatable than food stamps and other direct assistance that are viewed as handouts.
Just how much could these new tax credits help? That depends on who you ask. 
The changes in policy could fund the construction of an extra 1.22 million affordable rental units nationwide over the next 10 years, according to an estimate by the accounting firm Novogradac. That works out to roughly 20,000 extra units per year in California.
But many things could get in the way. If the cost of building goes up because of tariffs, increased labor costs or interest rate hikes, developers might decide not to use the tax credits. Trump’s spending package also keeps corporate tax rates low, which could reduce the value of the housing tax credits.
And, because housing is so expensive to build in California, most projects can’t rely solely on tax credits — they need other local and state funding, too. But that funding is in short supply. Extra money given out during the COVID-19 pandemic has dried up. A statewide $20 billion affordable housing bond was set to go before voters last year, but it was pulled off the ballot amid fears it would fail. 
As a result, Schwartz estimates California will see closer to 10,000 new low-income homes built per year as a result of these extra tax credits, not 20,000.
“I think it’s going to take us a couple of years to ramp up,” he said.
Another potential obstacle: The cuts Trump’s spending package imposes on other areas — including the cuts to Medicaid that are expected to result in 3.4 million Californians losing coverage over the next 10 years — could exacerbate poverty for many people and undermine the benefits of the tax credits. 
“It’s a tremendous irony,” Schwartz said, “that (the tax credit increase) was in this incredibly harmful ‘big ugly bill,’ as we call it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124
,California,2025-08-12 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"California taxpayers gave PG&E a huge, supposedly safe loan. The losses are already mounting",Malena Carollo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/08/diablo-canyon-loan/,Gov. Gavin Newsom assured lawmakers federal funds would eventually cover a $1.4 billion loan to keep the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant open. They could fall $588 million short.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom assured lawmakers federal funds would eventually cover a $1.4 billion loan to keep the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant open. They could fall $588 million short.


Two weeks before the 2022 legislative session ended, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration came to lawmakers with a big ask: authorize a $1.4 billion state loan to keep open California’s last nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon. The money was supposed to be a stopgap that would be fully repaid by an expected federal award. There was even a fail-safe: if the award fell short, other federal funds or profits from Diablo Canyon’s final year could cover the difference. 
The bill passed.
Despite promises from Newsom’s administration and legislators at the time, CalMatters found the state may be required to forgive as much as $588 million, about 42% of the loan. 
That’s partly because the maximum available federal award would never have covered the full loan. PG&E applied for even less than was available because an incentive fee allowed under the 2022 law isn’t eligible for federal reimbursement. 
One source of funding that could make up the difference—profit from the plant—is, by PG&E projections, unlikely to materialize. The only other avenue the state is considering—using federal money for nuclear waste storage—would cover a fraction of the shortfall and may not be legal. 
And the total is still mounting: PG&E said in a January filing that it expects its costs for the plant to exceed the state’s loan. 
The shortfall is emerging at a time when the state’s general fund is already facing a $12 billion budget hole, and advocates, lawmakers and regulators have raised concerns about portions of the loan benefiting PG&E shareholders, which the law forbids.
“It’s not a loan,” Matthew Freedman, lawyer for The Utility Reform Network, said. “It’s a gift.”
Diablo Canyon’s expensive new lease on life
Diablo Canyon is currently slated to stay open until 2030, five years after it was originally scheduled to shut down for economic reasons. The lifespan extension is meant to provide energy stability while California transitions to all-renewable sources by 2045. About 8% of California’s total energy comes from the San Luis Obispo County plant, as well as 17% of its carbon-free energy.
“It’s not a loan. It’s a gift.”Matthew Freedman, lawyer,  The Utility Reform Network, on California state loan of $1.4 billion to PG&E to keep the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant operating
Newsom’s administration and other proponents of the loan said it would be paid back fully with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s “Civil Nuclear Credit” program, an initiative by former President Joe Biden aimed at keeping open financially ailing nuclear power plants. 
Ana Matosantos, Newsom’s cabinet secretary at the time, testified before the state Assembly in August 2022 that the administration believed the funding “will offset the entirety of the loan.” Santa Cruz Democratic Sen. John Laird, a key vote to pass the bill, echoed this in a statement:
“The $1.4 billion loan expenditure will be matched with $1.4 billion in federal revenue, which limits the requirement of any ratepayer or taxpayer money for that purpose,” he said in September that year. 
But the federal award couldn’t have covered the full loan, CalMatters found. By law, the Department of Energy can only award $1.2 billion each cycle  – $200 million less than the general fund loan. And after the bill passed, PG&E applied for even less – $1.1 billion. 
The gulf of $300 million between the state loan and Department of Energy funds is money allowed under the 2022 law that rewards PG&E for keeping the plant online. The fee is not eligible for reimbursement under the Department of Energy nuclear credit program since it does not go into the cost of running the plant. 
The Department of Energy eventually approved the funding, but that doesn’t mean the state will get the full $1.1 billion. It is made up of a base award of $741.4 million and can go up to $1.1 billion if certain conditions are met by the end of 2026. Those conditions include expenses from unexpected outages, emergencies or new and unanticipated compliance requirements by the end of 2026, according to its agreement with the Department of Energy. 
Todd Allen, chair of the University of Michigan’s department of nuclear engineering and radiological sciences, said that the latter two conditions – emergencies and new compliance requirements – are unlikely. Emergencies are rare, and new compliance requirements are uncommon. More likely, he said, are unexpected outages. But those have been relatively uncommon at the plant – Diablo Canyon has had five unexpected outages in the past 10 years, the most recent in March 2024, according to reports filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. PG&E said it does not currently anticipate any unexpected outages.
“I would expect, if I was asked to bet on this, that the government payoff would be closer to the lower number,” said Allen.

The California Department of Water Resources was assigned to disburse the loan to PG&E and ensure that the funds were used for authorized costs. In a February report to the Legislature, the water agency said it expected at least the guaranteed amount of the federal funding to be used to repay the loan, but “at this point DWR is not able to forecast how much of the loan will be repaid.” It won’t know for sure until the Department of Energy begins to release the money in coming years.
One way the shortfall could be made up, according to the loan agreement, is through profit from the plant in its final year of operation – November 2029 to November 2030. The 2022 law defines this as “market revenues exceeding costs and expenses.” But PG&E doesn’t currently expect to have money to spare from the plant during that period. In its most recent projections, the company anticipates that its costs for Diablo Canyon will exceed the revenue from selling its energy on the wholesale market, leaving customers with a requirement to pay the difference. 
PG&E spokesperson Jennifer Robison did not directly answer questions about the plant’s projected financial performance. Instead, she said the plant would “provide an annual $540 million net cost benefit,” in large part through its resource adequacy contribution, a state requirement that each utility be able to generate enough energy to meet customer demand. 
In other words, Diablo Canyon could help state utilities avoid running out of power and having to buy it at higher prices, saving them hundreds of millions of dollars. Robison declined to answer further questions about this, including whether that benefit could be used to pay off the loan, and if so how much of it. 
The California Public Utilities Commission, PG&E’s regulator, said the resource adequacy figure PG&E referenced is not part of the cost of running the plant, thus is not included in profit calculations. It is “more accurately described,” commission spokesperson Adam Cranfill said, as “an avoided cost.”  
The other possible source for repayment is unspecified federal funds, which the law said PG&E is required to “take all necessary steps to secure.” The water department’s February projections said the most likely source for this is payment PG&E expects to receive for storing spent nuclear fuel. Because the federal government did not build a promised national repository for the fuel, the Department of Energy pays to have it stored elsewhere until a national facility is built. PG&E expects to receive about $63 million from this from 2026 to 2030. 
These funds, however, have historically been used to offset ratepayer costs. The 2022 law authorizing the state loan to PG&E specifies that “ratepayer funds shall not otherwise be used in any manner to repay the loan.” When asked how using these funds for the loan fits within the law, water department spokesperson Ryan Endean said the spent fuel money isn’t accounted for in any other ratemaking processes. Experts CalMatters reached out to were divided on whether these funds would count as ratepayer funds. Should they be allowed, they alone would not be enough to cover the difference between the state’s loan and the federal award.
Aggrieved legislators and ‘no leverage left’ over PG&E
PG&E did not answer CalMatters’ questions about what other federal funds it is pursuing to repay the loan. When describing how the loan could be paid back, Robison omitted other federal funds as a source that could be used for this.
Lawmakers raised concerns about whether the loan would be fully repaid as soon as the legislation was introduced. 
Sen. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco Democrat who chairs the state’s joint legislative budget committee, sent a series of letters to the California Department of Finance early last year requesting more information about the loan and its repayment, expressing dissatisfaction at the lack of details available. 
“Given the condition of the general fund, we believe it is poor financial judgment to provide a loan of this magnitude to an investor-owned utility without having basic loan repayment information,” Wiener said in a March 2024 letter. At the time, the water department had not seen a copy of the funding agreement between PG&E and the federal government, according to the finance department.
“It’s another thing that undermines public trust.”Tasha Boerner, San Diego Democratic Assemblymember, on issues with PG&E’s loan
Wiener’s committee attempted to stop the final installment of the loan from being given to PG&E last year, striking it from the budget. But less than a week later, it was added back with a new requirement for the water department to submit biannual reports about the loan’s repayment. 
“The state has no leverage left to hold over PG&E,” David Weisman, executive director of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility.
San Diego Democratic Assemblymember Tasha Boerner, who voted against the 2022 legislation, said “it’s another thing that undermines public trust.”
“Had we gone through the normal process in January, even if it was a special session in January to fast-track it and have that time to do the hearings, to do that due diligence,” she said, it “would have made a lot of people more comfortable.”
If no federal funds are found outside of the Department of Energy award and Diablo Canyon does not have additional revenue in its final year to pay the remaining loan, the state may be required to forgive any unpaid amount. Its contract with PG&E specifies that those three categories are the only sources of funding that can be used to repay the loan. 
Laird, who voted in favor of the 2022 bill, said having to forgive a portion of the loan would be “a big deal because that’s not the intent of the bill.’
“However much they [receive] short of $1.4 billion, we will be asking how that’s going to be made back without going on the taxpayers or the ratepayers,” he said. “We sort of set a standard, and we’re going to work to make sure they meet it.’As long as the loan funds are spent, PG&E isn’t on the hook for repaying any of the loan itself. 
PG&E expects to have spent those funds and more. 
The company forecasts overspending the loan by about $157 million through next year, according to a January filing in an unrelated lawsuit. When asked if that was still the company’s current forecast, PG&E said it is “actively working to implement its Diablo Canyon extended operations transition costs in alignment with the loan amount,” declining to provide a specific figure.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080825-Diablo-Canyon-BB-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

Jon Lines
5/24/1963 – 8/8/2025


Jon Lines passed to the beyond in the early morning hour on August 8th after a brief struggle with a hard illness. Surrounded by family, friends, and a soundtrack curated by siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews, he left this world with the love and care he brought to it.
Growing up in the South End of Burlington, in a neighborhood full of adventure and endless days of fun, Jon was the oldest of the Lines siblings born to Stratty and Beverly.
Down on South Cove, between Red Rocks Park and Oakledge in the 70/80s, some of the most epic games of 4 Square, Witch, and Prison Ball would ensue among the dozens of kids throughout the neighborhood.
And of course, there were also days of hanging out and eating at the family business, the Oasis Diner on Bank Street downtown.
Like so many generations of Greek diner families, Jon started working at the Oasis in his early teens and then branched out for a time and got a commercial drivers license. For a few years, he drove trucks for Merrill Transport, until the Oasis beckoned (Stratty needed a reliable cook) and he and his father forged a path that countless family businesses had trod before. Jon’s tireless work ethic, skills at the grill, and gift for gab made him a natural.
In the mid nineties Jon took over the Oasis and was joined by brother David to run the show for a decade. After selling the business in 2007, he went to work for Barrett Trucking. The Barretts had been part of the extended diner family and Jon became an indispensable member of the team until his recent illness. In these years, he was living a little kid’s dream of driving trucks and tractors for a living.
He was especially proud and always ready – no matter the time of day or number of hours behind the wheel – to aid in the now-annual flood recovery in Vermont, as Barrett trucks have become a key component of recovery efforts.
Jon is pre-deceased by his mother and father, Bev and Stratty, and his Uncle Chris, who helped manage the diner for many years and was an essential part of the fabric of Church Street. He is survived by brothers Gary and David, sister Maria, and their partners; his five nieces and nephews to whom he was a wonderful uncle; several close cousins; and a host of friends, including his crew at the Pour House and the Pub.
The family would like to extend deep gratitude to all the staff and medical professionals of UVMMC. Their dedication, care, understanding, and vast well of integrity will be forever appreciated. They are navigating so much in today’s world, and their resolute ability to help so many families like ours while dealing with endless crises should make this city proud of what it’s built for the challenging future.
Jon was a part of building the future – from building community through the diner to delivering materials for roads and bridges. He is gone too soon and will be deeply missed by many.

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)The Nevada Republican Party thinks the state should build its own high-security immigration detention center and name it “Coyote Compound.”
The party sent a fundraising email Aug. 8 asking if Nevada should follow Florida’s example and construct its own detention facility.
“Florida has Alligator Alcatraz — a high-security ICE detention center designed to detain and process illegal immigrants quickly and efficiently,” reads the email. “Now, we’re asking: Should Nevada have something similar? We’re calling it the Coyote Compound, and it would send a clear message: Nevada takes border security seriously.”
After the email heavily suggests what readers’ answers should be, the email urges readers to click a link to take a poll. And after submitting their preference for the “Coyote Compound” (“Yes,” “No,” or “I’m not sure”) readers are directed to a page where they’re invited to donate money to the party.
The state Republican Party, which did not respond to a request for comment, may have been more focused on raising money for itself instead of actually galvanizing government and community support for construction of a much-maligned — and expensive — detention camp. 
The detention center in Florida’s Everglades was opened last month. The hastily built facility, which is expected to hold up to 5,000 beds, has been heavily criticized for abhorrent conditions, a lack of transparency concerning practices and detainees, and environmental concerns. 
The ACLU has also warned of reports where people who are detained there “are fed maggot-infested food, denied medical care, not given access to water, flushing toilets, or showers, and are not allowed to go outside.”
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized $245 million in funding, provided by Florida taxpayers, to get the facility up and running.
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo and Republican state Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus did not respond to requests for comment.
“The crisis at the border isn’t just a border state problem anymore, it’s a national emergency, and Nevada needs to be part of the solution,” the Nevada Republican Party asserted in its email.
That claim seems to be at odds with Trump, who recently asserted “We now have the most secure border in modern American history.”
The email from the state Republican Party advocating a Florida-style immigration detention camp happened to be sent the same day Lombardo confirmed he would authorize the Nevada National Guard to assist with President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. 
Laura Martin, the executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada and a steering committee member of the Nevada Immigrant Coalition decried the Republican Party’s push, even if only in a fundraising email, for a “Coyote Compound.” 
“Joe Lombardo is the de facto leader of the Nevada Republican party and this kind of violent, racist rhetoric is exactly what is taking our state down a path of economic collapse,” Martin said. “Nevadans deserve strong leadership that respects all residents, not culture war-chasing gimmicks designed to remind people why our nickname is the Mississippi of the West.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/alligatoralcatraz-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

However, that growth hasn’t been enough to bridge the marked gender disparity in science, technology, engineering and math, a report from Utah State University’s Utah Women and Leadership Project says. 
Women’s participation in STEM fields in Utah has increased from 17.1% in 2015 to 24% in 2023. That, in researchers’ books, represents a win. The number, however, lags behind other growth metrics those industries have shown nationwide.
“Utah has made progress in the last few years in decreasing occupational segregation (the disparity between the number of women and men in a field or industry) in STEM,” the report says. “However, there still are far more men in STEM occupations than women, and Utah is behind the nation in this domain.”

While Salt Lake City ranks No. 12  on the list of best cities for STEM jobs in the country, according to the financial consultant WalletHub, Utah’s capital is only the 35th best for “STEM-friendliness.” That’s a score partially determined by the disparity of women versus men in STEM occupations and degree fields, according to the report.
Utah women made up 24% of the state’s STEM workforce in 2023, up from the 20.9% recorded in 2019, a number that Kolene Anderson, associate director at the Utah Women and Leadership Project, celebrated. But, that’s still not proportionate with the general growth of STEM occupations in the state, which was 17.7% from 2019 to 2023. 
Because women are less likely to pursue STEM education, they are less likely to be in these fields that are associated with high growth and high wages, Anderson said. But also, with technologies like artificial intelligence emerging, diversity in that workforce is essential to help solve challenges with discrimination and sexism that have occurred in the past, she said.
“As technology advances, as social challenges become more complex, we need women in those spaces as well to talk about potential solutions,” Anderson said, “just so that we can be more inclusive.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Women and men don’t significantly differ in their math and science abilities. But, they do have different levels of interest, confidence and sense of belonging in the STEM industry, researchers wrote. 
“This disparity is caused by several factors, including the lack of female role models, bias in the industry, and pressure to balance life and work, to name a few,” according to the brief. 
Utah girls consistently score lower in math benchmark exams than boys in 4th and 8th grades, according to the report. That, Anderson said, influences whether or not girls have the confidence and interest to pursue careers in STEM fields.
“I believe that is a very ingrained cultural, social thing. How do we figure out exactly what the cause of that is? That’s complex,” Anderson said. “But I suspect, and I think most researchers suspect, that it’s more of a social challenge to resolve. It’s not a capability issue, it’s a social issue.”
Mixed messages 
Added to this mix is what Anderson describes as “mixed messages” from the Utah Legislature.
In 2024, the state passed a law restricting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public entities, limiting programs based on “personal identity characteristics,” including gender. That same year, the Legislature also approved a non-binding resolution promoting opportunities for women in STEM.
With cuts of federal funding for gender research, the scenario has become even more confusing and frustrating, she said, especially since research shows that “having a watered down version of supporting everybody is less effective than targeting specific initiatives where you’re trying to get women or minorities involved in STEM.”
This year, the state also approved a law requiring public universities to cut 10% of their budgets for courses, aiming to step away from “inefficient” programs and invest more in high-demand degrees. Lawmakers often listed some STEM jobs as careers they would like to propel as part of the budget restructuring — a positive approach, in Anderson’s perspective.
“But I hope that in the process, the sentiment of that joint resolution that they passed last year doesn’t get lost,” Anderson said. Especially, when including more women in these fields is both good for innovation, the economy, and Utah women, girls and their families.

(John R. Roby for Alabama Reflector)HUNTSVILLE – Surrounded by the materiel of missile defense – sensors, circuits and rocket motor mockups – four of the nearly 10,000 military and civilian professionals of the space and defense community who convened here last week pondered a side question.
Why did the Space and Missile Defense Symposium make so little mention of “Golden Dome for America,” President Donald Trump’s missile defense initiative that has been described as a “Manhattan Project-level effort”?
In one of his first actions after taking office in January, Trump called for a renewed focus on missile defense, including a network of space-based sensors and interceptors that harkened back to President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative. Trump has said the effort will cost $175 billion and be “fully operational” by the end of his term.
During the Space and Missile Defense symposium last week, the industry’s message was clear: Alabama stands to gain through this new investment. But what remains murky is the extent that Trump’s callback to Reagan’s “Star Wars” initiative will pay dividends in the Rocket City – or anywhere else.
Critics have called the president’s timetable overly ambitious, and the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost at a half-trillion dollars over 20 years.
About $25 billion has been appropriated so far, though specific programs were not designated by Congress. The Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is working on two multibillion-dollar contracting vehicles around Golden Dome, the larger of which is still in the presolicitation phase.
Publicly and privately, industry executives are signaling that Alabama might benefit most from a more down-to-Earth version of the president’s vision.
Raymond Sharp, who as vice president of missile defense solutions for Northrop Grumman leads up that company’s Huntsville-based Golden Dome efforts, described the initial push as scaling existing capacity and ensuring various systems can sync up in ways they were not necessarily designed to do.
“Golden Dome is missile defense on a massive scale, but I think our industry is ready for this moment,” he said. “There’ll be new capabilities required, but we’ll also be employing our existing capabilities in new and different ways: layering and integrating like never seen before.”
Yet while industry executives spent three days in Huntsville’s Von Braun Center telling the military’s missile defense leaders and procurement professionals they were ready with solutions, the Pentagon often played defense.
“We’ve been told every year that we’ve been in existence that it’ll never work, you’re not doing it right, and you probably spent too much money and shouldn’t exist,” Lt. Gen Heath Collins, MDA director, said in a Thursday spech to close the symposium.
Minutes later, he said he would not be answering questions from the audience or the media.
“In the last six months I’ve walked into many, many rooms and said, ‘I can’t take questions on You Know What,’ and I’ve never received a question other than something about You Know What,” he said. “So let’s just avoid that.”

Dare not speak its name

Collins was referring to the central paradox of this year’s SMD: At an event where Golden Dome loomed large, Pentagon officials were reportedly ordered to avoid mentioning it.
The symposium itself had to play catchup. A panel titled “Golden Dome for America” was scrubbed just before the conference began, with the conference website stating, “Information regarding Golden Dome for America will be promulgated by the government.”
That took the form of a separate session for industry leaders after the symposium wrapped. Despite being unclassified, the session was closed to media.
In a sense, it was standard fare for the Von Braun Center’s concert hall, where theater and fantasy routinely play out in a venue named for a rocket pioneer. For three days, Golden Dome was The Scottish Play.
So Collins referred not to Golden Dome but to “the return of priority and focus on the missile defense enterprise … within the past six months” and to the, “new imperative to bring a national capability to bear” on missile defense. Another MDA official spoke of the “policy changes [included in] the president’s January executive order.”
“That was the change from a focus on rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and a focus on peers and near-peers,” said Dan Poskey, director of program management and integration, space capabilities for the Missile Defense Agency. “Now we’re looking at threat sets associated with China and Russia, and it really changes the paradigm.”

The golden road

Absent a clear signal from government, executives of the nation’s largest defense contractors stuck to the tried-and-true this week in Huntsville.
And in truth, missile defense is having a moment.
“Everybody’s eyes were opened [during the] war between Iran and Israel,” said Stan Stafira, chief architect with the Missile Defense Agency. 
The community took notice, he said, of the sheer number of ballistic missiles that required interdiction – more than 500 in a 12-day span – as well as the massive, long-range drone strikes of the Russia-Ukraine war. Both conflicts have driven home the importance of layered engagement: Different missile defense systems must have overlapping coverage so the right tool can be used when needed.
“No single system will be able to handle it all,” Stafira said.
The United States’ existing ballistic missile defense consists of four main interdiction systems, supported by multiple sensors and command and control infrastructures. Three of them – Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) – have been combat-tested in Israel, Ukraine or both in the past year.
All three are mobile, with Aegis launched from U.S. Navy vessels, and THAAD and PAC-3 from truck-mounted launchers. The fourth, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), launches interceptor missiles from fixed silos in Alaska and California. All four address missile threats at different ranges and stages of flight; when combined, they are said to be “layered.”
That combination, though, has historically not been a priority for homeland missile defense, which has been focused on stopping a small-scale launch from a rogue adversary like North Korea.
Johnathon Caldwell, vice president and general manager of strategic missile defense systems for Lockheed Martin, said his company, as the prime contractor for THAAD, Aegis and PAC-3, is “on the front lines” of defending U.S. and allied forces in global hotspots.
“All of these things are happening because we have a layered defense of capabilities … connected by command and control,” he said.
That, in turn, is a model for Golden Dome, he said – layered missile defense applied more systematically to the United States. He maintained it is an achievable goal.
“This is going to be an effort … where we take combat-proven technologies [and] we combine them with innovation and industrial scale partnerships,” he said. “I think we’ll get our playbook soon, [but] our job right now is to get ourselves into shape, hone our skills and build our muscles and our relationships so we can … stand up to this new scale of layered homeland defense.”
James Johnson, senior vice president for space solutions with Parsons Corp., said the key difference between existing capacity and Trump’s Golden Dome vision would come down to scale. He predicted it would initially involve “more of everything” – those interdiction, sensing and command and control systems already in use – in light of lessons from recent global conflicts.
“The president’s drawing a line in the sand for the end of his administration,” he said. “Whatever we’ve got at that point is the initial capability. It will not be perfect, but it will evolve.”

‘We do a lot of that here in Huntsville’

(John R. Roby for Alabama Reflector)
Alabama is positioned to be a key part of that scaling and evolution.
Industry is banking on most Golden Dome procurement dollars flowing – at least initially – into existing systems, particularly those that have been fielded successfully. And the state is already home to a vast and growing defense base that touches aspects of all U.S. missile defense systems in existence.
Misty Holmes, RTX’s vice president for shipboard missiles, said the company’s Raytheon division is seeing “strong demand focus” since the SM-3 saw its combat debut in April 2024, when they first intercepted Iranian ballistic missiles bound for Israel.
“We’re continuing to see unbelievable rates of utility in these weapons defending our sailors, our allied sailors and international allied friends … the demand signal is loud and clear,” she said.
Raytheon has been scaling up its capacity both in its own facilities and through the production chain. The company is nearing completion of a $115 million expansion of its missile integration facility on Redstone Arsenal, where the company integrates all variants of its Standard Missile family. The growth will allow it to expand production by 50% and is expected to bring 185 new jobs to the region.
Boeing is also growing its manufacturing footprint in north Alabama, with an 35,000-square-foot expansion expected to come online this year. The company makes “seekers,” or guidance systems, for the PAC-3 missile in Huntsville as a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin, and recently announced a record of over 500 deliveries in 2024. The new facility is expected to boost production by 30%.
The growth will “meet current demands of the day but also plan for the challenges we’re going to face in the future,” said Pierce Lehr, Boeing vice president for global supply chain and integration.
Josh Jackson, executive vice president of SAIC’s Army Business Group, said data will be key to making the nest of interdictors, sensors and command and control infrastructure work at scale.
The company’s Huntsville operation is its second-largest worldwide, and its focus is on data integration, or turning the riot of “noise” generated by hundreds of sources across services and platforms into a clear, actionable signal for units on the ground.
“That’s what we’ve focused on: how can you create a data fabric that allows multiple systems that usually don’t talk to each other to interoperate seamlessly so you can provide better situational awareness, [allowing for] crisper decision-making for commanders,” Jackson said.
If data is a frontier of Golden Dome, space-based interdiction is the promised land. Trump’s executive order specifically mentions it – but it’s considered the thorniest and most expensive of problems in missile defense.
Yet steps are being taken in Huntsville as well. Leidos’ Dynetics subsidiary is building the common hypersonic glide body, a housing for offensive and defensive hypersonic missiles, under a $670 million Army contract. Lockheed Martin, General Atomics and Raytheon subcontract parts of the process at several Alabama facilities.
“This system, that we’ve been working with our customers to mature and build the industrial base for, brings a lot of capability that will be increasingly important as we talk about space-based interceptors,” said Jason Morgan, vice president and CTO for Leidos.
Whether Golden Dome launches with a space-based component must wait until Trump’s end-of-term deadline. But the capacity for near-term production ramp-ups and systems integration work exists now in north Alabama – and industry has an appetite to expand it.

(Image via White House livestream)Four days before a scheduled meeting with the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, over the possibility of a ceasefire that could pause the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Donald Trump has yet to announce a firm location or timing.
Trump said last week on social media that he would meet Putin in Alaska on Friday.
Speaking to reporters Monday at the White House, Trump said he would seek to temporarily end the fighting that has resulted since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
He said he isn’t certain what a long-term peace deal would involve, but it likely would entail “some swapping … some changes in land,” he said.
“We’re going to change the lines, the battle lines. Russia has occupied a big portion of Ukraine. They’ve occupied some very prime territory. We’re going to try and get some of that territory back for Ukraine. But they’ve taken some very prime territory,” Trump said.
In a video address Sunday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to reject the idea of surrendering land for peace, saying in part that “Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier.”
Zelenskyy has not been invited to Trump’s talks with Putin.
In meandering remarks Monday, Trump twice appeared to misstate the location of the expected talks, saying at one point, “We’re going to Russia,” before correctly returning to Alaska as the location. 
“I thought it was very respectful that the president of Russia is coming to our country instead of us going to his country or a third-party place. I think we’ll have constructive conversations, and then after that meeting, immediately — maybe as I’m flying out, maybe as I’m leaving the room — I’ll be calling the European leaders who I get along with very well and have a great relationship with, I think, all of them,” Trump said Monday. 
“I get along with Zelenskyy, but I disagree with what he’s done, very very severely disagree. This is a war that shouldn’t have happened … but I’ll be speaking with Zelenskyy. The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin, or Zelenskyy, Putin and me. I’ll be there if they need, but I want to have a meeting set up between the two leaders,” Trump said.
Asked what he would consider a good deal between Russia and Ukraine, the president said he hasn’t made up his mind.
“I’ll tell you after I hear what the deal is, because there could be many definitions,” Trump said.
“We’re going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin,” he said, “and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be, because that’s what I do.”

Apart from persuading voters, there are looming political and legal battles.","Gov. Gavin Newsom justifies — or rationalizes — his drive for a mid-decade reconfiguration of California’s congressional districts as a heroic mission to thwart President Donald Trump’s power grab.
Newsom, who seems to be edging ever closer to a 2028 presidential campaign, proposes to alter the state’s 53 districts to shift five or six seats now held by Republicans into Democratic hands during the 2026 elections.
If successful, it would neutralize efforts by Texas Republicans to gerrymander its districts to gain a similar number of seats. Republicans hold a paper-thin majority in the House of Representatives and Trump has sought mid-decade redistricting in Texas and other red states to block Democrats from gaining control in 2026.
The Texas situation is in limbo because Democratic legislators have fled the state, but how long they can hold out is unclear. Newsom played host to some Texas Democrats last week as he talked up action in California, which would require voter approval in a November special election.
“I think the voters will approve it. I think the voters understand what’s at stake,” Newsom said on Friday. “We live in the most un-Trump state in America.”
Well maybe, but Democratic gerrymandering of California’s districts will not be as easy as Republican gerrymandering in Texas.
In Texas, as in most states, the legislature controls redistricting. Under its current maps, enacted after the 2020 census, Republicans hold 25 of its 38 seats, Democrats have 12 and there’s one vacancy.
Ironically, Democrats fare much better in Texas than Republicans do in California, where the GOP holds just nine of the state’s 53 seats under maps drawn by an independent commission. Newsom, backed by Democratic legislative leaders, wants voters to set aside the commission’s maps for as many as three election cycles and approve a new plan with more Democratic districts.
If Texas moves forward, the proposal, which has not been shared publicly, would require the California Legislature to place it on the ballot after lawmakers return next week from summer recess — and just four days to act under current law. However, the Legislature has often exempted itself from ballot measure deadlines, so one must assume that the proposal will make the ballot.
That’s the easy part for Newsom. He would still have to persuade voters who are no more than lukewarm despite the unpopularity of Trump in California, according to private polling.
Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who championed the creation of an independent redistricting commission, says he’ll oppose Newsom’s plan and Charles Munger Jr., a wealthy scientist who bankrolled two ballot measures to create the commission, says he’ll support an opposition campaign.
Given the stakes, Trump and Republicans would probably flood the state with opposition campaign money while Democrats would do the same, with even more money coming from labor unions and other Democratic allies.
Newsom also faces the possibility of legal battles, such as issues over what data he uses to draw the new districts. 
The state commission used numbers from the 2020 census, which pegged California’s population at 39,538,223. The latest estimate from the Department of Finance’s demographic unit is 39,529,000, a tiny difference. However, there are also differences within the state, according to the state’s estimates, with coastal counties tending to lose population while inland counties gaining.
Districts must be equal in population — within tight tolerances — but also must not disenfranchise protected ethnic groups, according to federal law.
These factors all could be bases for litigation, perhaps including intervention by Trump’s Department of Justice. After the 2000 census, the threat of federal intervention played a big role in the California Legislature’s previous redistricting effort, blocking Democrats from drawing partisan maps.
Prolonged litigation could block Newsom’s plan from taking effect in 2026 even if he gains voter approval this year. This game is just beginning.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080825-Texas-Democrats-Presser-FG-CM-14.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

Where is the district located?

The district covers part of Cullman, including Good Hope, Garden City, Colony and Smith Lake. 
How did the seat become vacant?
The seat became vacant after former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April. Harbison was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session.
Does the seat have a partisan lean?
District 11 is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022.
What issues dominate the race?
SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, was signed by Gov. Kay Ivey on May 7. The law allows the city of Cullman to annex a resort in Cullman County, a dry county, in order for the resort to serve alcohol.
The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 11 special election, scheduled for Aug. 26. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. Any annexation proposal would have to go through Cullman City Council, which Hollingsworth serves on. He said last week he would not support a proposal, and he and the city council president said they had not heard a proposal. Myrex, who also opposed the law, said she heard constituents’ concerns about the property being used for a casino, but Gudger added a provision to the law before final passage that prohibits such use of the property.
What happens after today?
The winner will face Democratic candidate Matthew Glover, a 40-year-old former Good Hope City councilman, on Oct. 28.

Will the results alter control of the Legislature?

No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24. Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, announced her resignation and move to the Florida panhandle last week. Republicans hold 27 of the 35 seats in the Alabama Senate.

Santiago/Getty Images)Only a few years after the pandemic, young kids in this country are seeing a whole new disruption to their learning: immigration raids.
One of the Trump administration’s first actions after assuming office was to rescind the Biden administration’s guidelines for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which limited enforcement activity in “sensitive locations” like schools and churches.
Since then, immigration raids have escalated — often under questionable pretenses. This spring, immigration agents tried to enter two elementary schools in Los Angeles. At the door, agents said they wanted to determine students’ well-being and claimed to have authorization from the children’s caretakers.
Administrators denied them entry — and when they spoke with caretakers later, they learned that agents had lied about receiving permission. “I’m absolutely incensed that DHS agents would try to enter elementary schools,” said Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA). “These are children who should be learning to read and write, not cowering in fear of being ripped away from their homes.”
Unfortunately, schools are no longer a safe haven for our students. You can imagine the trauma and disruption that comes from armed agents entering schools and removing students. But these raids will also have long-term implications on learning outcomes, mental health, and even school funding for children enrolled in public schools nationwide.
And we’re seeing that now in rising rates of absenteeism.
In June, Stanford professor Thomas Dee published a groundbreaking report detailing the relationship between raids and school absences. Focusing on recent raids in California’s Central Valley region, Dee studied attendance data from over three years at five nearby school districts. Dee was able to correlate raids with a 22 percent increase in student absenteeism, particularly affecting youngest learners.
In the weeks following Dee’s report, media outlets from across the county — from New York to Denver and Chicago — reported similar patterns of immigration raids leading to increased student absences. Fearful of raids, families across the nation have opted to keep their children home.
In many states, including California, school funding is determined by average daily attendance. This means that the more students miss school, the less that school will receive going forward. So when a raid forces a student to miss school, it doesn’t just impact their own learning — it also means fewer resources for their classmates, teachers, and their entire district.
This threatens the public school ecosystem, inflicting long-term harm on a generation of students already recovering from pandemic-era setbacks. “Absences are both more common for everybody, but they are also more extreme,” said Jacob Kirksey, an associate professor of education policy at Texas Tech. Raids “can essentially create what we found from COVID — this generation of students who have a patently different experience with schooling.”
Importantly, students and educators still have rights. For instance, a school district cannot ask about a student’s citizenship or immigration status as proof of that student’s residency. Students have the right to withhold this information, and schools may not prohibit that student from enrollment if they do not disclose it.
You can explore your legal protections as a student or an educator by visiting MySchoolMyRights.com, a website published by the ACLU where you’ll find clear, accessible guidance on what ICE can or can’t do in schools.
Over half of American voters believe schools should not be touched by immigration raids. They understand that ICE raids on schools don’t make communities safer. They make classrooms emptier and schools more vulnerable to funding cuts.
We must advocate on behalf of those students by demanding transparency and passing policies that limit ICE access to protect our students and families. We owe all kids a safe haven at school and the freedom to learn without fear.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2219519292-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez take questions from Hudson County residents during a talk at the county's community college on Aug. 11, 2025. (Photo courtesy of McIver's office)Rep. LaMonica McIver said she will continue to fight for congressional oversight of immigration detention centers, despite facing federal charges accusing her of assaulting officers during a May visit to a migrant jail in Newark.
McIver (D-10) told the New Jersey Monitor at an event in Jersey City Monday that the case against her has been “definitely stressful.”
“When you talk about a person coming to charge you because you were there to do your job and they’re telling you you can get 17 years in prison, that’s nothing to joke with. I’m a mother, I’m a wife, I have a family,” she said. 
McIver was joined by Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08) at Hudson County Community College in Jersey City for what they billed as a dialogue series to discuss their “shared experiences and work fighting for our communities in the time of Trump.”
The two recalled an immigration raid in Newark that occurred less than 48 hours after President Donald Trump took office for his second term, along with their often confrontational visits to detention centers. 
McIver, Menendez, and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12) showed up at Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed migrant detention center in Newark, on May 9 for an unannounced inspection of the facility. Their visit ended in chaos, with federal officers arresting Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and charging him with trespassing, then later charging McIver and accusing her of shoving agents as they took Baraka into custody. She pleaded not guilty, and her trial is tentatively set to begin in November (the charges against Baraka were quickly dropped).
Menendez recalled from his visit to Delaney Hall that the building was dirty, the telephones were not working, and the three members of Congress got stuck in an elevator. Baraka and other Newark officials have accused Delaney Hall’s owners, private prison firm Geo Group, of opening the facility without proper city permits and inspections.
McIver noted on Monday that after the incident at Delaney Hall made national headlines, the Department of Homeland Security attempted to stop members of Congress from making unannounced visits to immigrant detention centers by requiring them to alert the department seven days in advance. An appropriations law in effect since 2019 grants a lawmaker the ability to conduct oversight of such centers without prior approval from the department or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“It hasn’t changed — it’s just that the administration wants it to change, so they literally put out a guidance, but you can’t just change policy because you want to,” McIver said. “That’s not how it works.”
Menendez noted that he and other members of New Jersey’s House delegation fought federal policies on immigration under the Biden administration, too. He was among the lawmakers who signed a letter sent to then-President Biden urging him to stop fighting a New Jersey law that bars companies from contracting with ICE to detain immigrants. That law suffered a setback last month when, after a lengthy court battle, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it cannot apply to private companies, paving the way for more federal detention centers to open.
“The writing was on the wall that if Trump were to win, you’re going to see the most expansive immigration enforcement policies and actions that we’ve ever seen, and that’s what’s happening today,” Menendez said.
The Trump administration is eyeing a massive camp for undocumented immigrants at Fort Dix.  
“I think they have an insatiable appetite for this, and it’s not about violent criminals,” Menendez said.

We care deeply about where and how our kids learn — and we want a say in it. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Laura Cannon: Preserve local school boards. Preserve local democracy. .","This commentary is by Laura Cannon, of Hardwick. Laura is a parent of two preschoolers, a speech-language pathologist and a member of the Rural School Community Alliance.


We won’t always agree with every decision our school boards make — but we should all agree on this: They must exist. Without them, we lose local democracy, community involvement and taxpayer oversight. 
Whether you’re from Hardwick, Newport, Wells, Brattleboro or Grand Isle, one thing is clear: Our communities value taking local responsibility for education, community-based schooling and school board representation. We care deeply about where and how our kids learn — and we want a say in it. 
The Rural Schools Community Alliance — a coalition of community and municipal groups, school boards, and educators — has fought hard to preserve these values in the current legislation. Thanks to their efforts, the new law Act 73 recognizes supervisory unions in addition to supervisory districts, giving rural voices a chance to be heard. But the Rural Schools Community Alliance cannot do this alone. Now it’s our turn.

So, what’s at stake? 
If existing school districts are eliminated and replaced by a large supervisory district — as favored by Gov. Phil Scott and Agency of Education — our local school boards would vanish. Existing articles of agreement would be dissolved. Decision-making power would shift to a distant, centralized board overseeing 4,000 to 8000 students. Town-level representation would disappear. Budget decisions and school closures would happen without a vote of the town. 
Under a supervisory union structure, by contrast, existing school boards would continue as would existing articles of agreement. Although this may entail boundary shifts and much larger supervisory unions than we are used to, we would keep a seat at the table. We would continue to have a meaningful voice in decisions made. We would keep our say. 
Some advocacy groups argue that supervisory unions open the door to privatization. That’s a distraction. The real threat is centralized power in sprawling districts, where communities lose influence. Supervisory unions allow for shared efficiencies, collaboration and cost-effective shared services, without silencing community voices. That’s the balance Vermont needs. 
Act 73 established a redistricting committee that has been appointed and is already beginning their work, with up to three proposals due in December and a vote by the Legislature to approve one in January. 
We must act now to influence the outcome. We are not powerless, and there are knowledgeable members on this committee who understand rural concerns. Talk to your school board. Call your legislators. Let them know that we want to stay in a supervisory union. We value local decision making.
Much of Vermont is rural. Our education system should reflect that and be accessible for rural families. 
Without community-based schooling, transportation challenges and long bus rides may force young families like mine to leave Vermont’s small towns at a faster rate than they already are, further accelerating small-town economic decline. 
Consolidation of school governance means disappearing civic engagement and a diminished ability to influence important decisions about education in the future — that’s what we risk if we let our school boards go.
This is a fight for more than education. It’s a fight for our communities. It’s a fight for democracy. It’s a fight for rural Vermont.

(Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)Attorneys for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward and the Indiana Attorney General’s Office are sparring before the state’s highest court over whether Ward’s tentative execution date should stand.
Ward’s defense team, in a July 30 filing, urged the Indiana Supreme Court to “recall” the tentative Oct. 10 date based on “new evidence,” which includes sworn affidavits of witnesses to Benjamin Ritchie’s execution in May, as well as postmortem toxicology reports from both Ritchie and another executed inmate, Joseph Corcoran.
But the state argued Monday that Ward has no valid legal grounds to delay his execution, and that his latest claims are “irrelevant” and belong in a different court.
Ward raped and murdered 15‑year‑old Stacy Payne in her Spencer County home in 2001.
Witnesses at Ritchie’s execution described seeing the inmate “violently” lifting “his head and shoulders off the gurney after the execution drug, pentobarbital, was administered,” according to court filings. 
The defense team filed five witness affidavits: one from Ritchie’s spiritual advisor, who was present in the execution chamber; another from Ritchie’s friend, who viewed the execution from the condemned’s witness room; and three from Indiana public defender staff — two of Ritchie’s attorneys and a mitigation specialist.
Story continues below.
Ward filings
 
“Mr. Ritchie violently lifted his head and shoulders off the gurney after the execution drug was administered. That should not happen when non-expired and uncontaminated pentobarbital is properly administered,” defense attorneys wrote. “Witnesses described the movement as ‘violent,’ ‘abrupt,’ and ‘unnatural’ — inconsistent with a properly carried out execution using a barbiturate.”
The defense argued the movement indicated possible contamination, degradation or improper administration of the drug.
“Such movements indicate that Mr. Ritchie may have experienced pain and distress due to either the use of expired or contaminated drugs or the failure to properly administer the execution drug,” Ward’s attorneys wrote.
The Attorney General’s Office countered in a Monday afternoon filing that Ward has not given the court a “legally cognizable reason to deny the State’s motion” for the execution to go ahead as planned and that “all of his complaints are irrelevant to this Court’s legal duty to set an execution date.”
“Ultimately,” state attorneys continued, “Ward’s assemblage of various complaints about a different inmate’s execution, public-record requests, and government-procurement transparency have nothing to do with whether this Court should follow the law and set his execution date.”
Ward argues for a delay
Ward’s attorneys additionally accused the state of withholding critical information about the Indiana Department of Correction’s lethal injection drugs, specifically “whether they are expired, how they are transported and stored, or their potency and sterility.” 
Despite public records requests — several of which are not processed — the defense team said there has been “no disclosure regarding the amount of the drug” in DOC’s possession” and called the lack of transparency “shocking and unfair.”
Ward’s filing also pointed to Senate Enrolled Act 5, an Indiana transparency law effective July 1 that requires certain state contracts to be posted online. 
Ward’s team contends that DOC “must post a bid for proposals to obtain the drugs necessary for Mr. Ward’s execution” and take “the thirty days to solicit proposals from contractors to ensure transparency and cost effectiveness.”
Story continues below.
Witness Statements
 
Gov. Mike Braun said recently that Indiana does not currently have usable lethal injection drugs, and that state lawmakers should debate the future of capital punishment in Indiana in the 2026 session.
Braun said, too, that he doesn’t “intend to put another [dose] on the shelf” and risk expiration, although his office clarified that additional execution drugs would be ordered when required by the state supreme court.
In June, the governor disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
Ward’s attorneys asked the court to “deny the request to set an execution date, grant Ward’s request to file a Successive Post-Conviction Petition and remand for evidentiary proceedings in the post-conviction court.”
State makes case to proceed
In a separate filing, the Indiana Attorney General’s Office argued that Ward’s proposed claims are “meritless” and filed in the wrong forum. They held that post-conviction rules only allow challenges to the validity of a conviction or sentence, not on grounds involving civil-rights or the method of execution. 
Even if such claims were permitted, the office argued, the remedies Ward seeks — like forcing public-records disclosures, halting his execution until he’s satisfied with execution drug testing, or altering the execution chamber — are not authorized under the rules for post-conviction proceedings and instead belong in a separate civil-rights lawsuit.
Story continues below.
State Responses
 
“Whether any of these claims have merit” is irrelevant, state attorneys wrote, because “none of them are legal reasons why this Court should not follow the mandates” of state law and set an execution date.
As such, the state said Ward’s witness affidavits and toxicology-related evidence are outside the scope of current proceedings.
And in response to Ward’s transparency claims, the state argued SEA 5 does not apply to lethal-injection procurement because “the identity of a supplier of lethal-injection drugs and any ‘information reasonably calculated’ to identify the supplier is confidential by law” under Indiana Code.
The state also criticized Ward’s public-records complaints, saying his “personal surprise or sense of indignation is simply not a legal argument.” The attorney general’s team doubled down that public-records disputes have “nothing at all to do with whether this Court should set an execution date.”

The state noted, too, that Ward still has judicial remedies under Indiana’s public-records law that he has not used, such as challenging records request denials or delays. 
The attorney general’s office further rejected Ward’s complaints about limited audio and visual access for witnesses to his execution. They argued that neither the lack of sound between the execution chamber and witness room nor the viewing glass arrangement violates constitutional protections.
It’s now up to the Indiana Supreme Court to decide whether Ward’s execution date will be finalized or delayed for further litigation.
Justices previously indicated that an execution date remains pending until the court issues a definitive ruling.
Ward’s case has spanned more than two decades. His initial conviction and death sentence were overturned due to concerns about pretrial publicity, but a second jury sentenced him to death again in 2007 after he pleaded guilty. His appeals concluded in 2017.
Court records indicate Ward attacked Payne after she answered the door of her Dale, Indiana, home shortly after noon on July 11, 2001. Her younger sister heard screams and called 911. Police arrived within minutes and found Ward standing in the doorway of the home, holding a knife. He was arrested at the scene. 
Payne, an honor roll student, later died from severe injuries.

Its board members include Gov. Tim Walz, State Auditor Julie Blaha, Secretary of State Steve Simon, and Attorney General Keith Ellison.
The State Board of Investment pledges to “consider all material risks and opportunities” including those from climate change and the energy transition, according to Minnesota’s Climate Roadmap.
That’s why the board should take a close look at the implications of its investments in Energy Capital Partners, which is currently seeking an additional $250 million investment from the state.
This is concerning because while Energy Capital Partners claims to have a focus on “sustainability infrastructure providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy,” it is in the process of purchasing the General James M. Gavin coal-fired power plant. Gavin is a 50-year-old coal plant in southeastern Ohio and is one of the most deadly power plants in the nation in terms of health effects due to air pollution with a history of public health and environmental violations.
The Gavin power plant represents risks to its owners due to ongoing litigation regarding expensive toxic coal ash cleanup requirements, the plant’s high debt burden, and the unstable future for coal, not to mention the reputational risks associated with owning a power plant that has been associated with over 200 premature deaths per year and $1.7 billion in costs associated with health problems from the plant’s pollution.
The Gavin coal plant is the single biggest contributor to Energy Capital Partners’ health impacts. According to research released this summer, emissions from Energy Capital Partner’s assets nationally are estimated to cause between $1.8 and $3.3 billion in costs related to health impacts each year. The emissions are estimated to cause 62,000 asthma incidents, 130 emergency room visits, 11,000 lost work days, $15,000 lost school days, and over 200 premature deaths.
Minnesota should not rely on returns from an out-of-state power plant that causes the premature deaths of hundreds of people each year to fund the retirement of state employees.
The Minnesota State Board of Investment has an opportunity to collaborate with Energy Capital Partners to insist on a thoughtful retirement plan for the Gavin coal plant.

(Photo by Getty Images)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.

Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”
 Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

Previously, such officials may have opened their accounts on a four-year cycle timed with their campaigns, meaning they only filed reports once every four years. Now, any elected official making at least $5,000 annually, which includes county council members and many township trustees, will be subject to the new requirements. 
 
For more information from the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office, visit here.


Many of these local offices might be reckoning with such annual reporting requirements for the first time, said David Bottorff, the executive director of the Association of Indiana Counties. Prior to the law, such officials may have only dealt with such reports during a campaign year.
“(As a candidate,) I may or may not accept contributions from outside (entities) or seek contributions. For some of the county offices, especially county assessor or treasurer … they may be self-funded,” he said.
Because of that, Bottorff said, a newly elected official may then close their campaign account while in office, opting to open a new account if they run for reelection. 
“Going forward, you’ll just have to report that,” he said. “If you’re not doing anything, they would just report zeros.” 
However, Bottorff said there might be a gray area for an incumbent politician going to a political party dinner or buying tickets for a local fish fry with their own money.
“Some people might think, ‘Well, that’s not campaigning,’ but, if you’re there as an elected official, arguably, you’re there as a candidate as well,” Bottorff said. 
The change stems from a definition shift under House Enrolled Act 1679, a wide-ranging elections omnibus bill. Over hours of committee testimony, neither the bill authors nor its supporters speculated about the impact on local offices, saying only that the word “candidate” was used in different ways throughout Indiana code. Having one definition would simplify election and campaign finance law throughout Indiana statute. 
Candidates for local offices file their campaign finance statements and reports to the appropriate county offices, potentially adding to the work of those elected officials. A local elected official will also need to keep their campaign account open if they make more than $500 in contributions or expenditures, regardless of whether they earn less than $5,000 or not.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner) For more than two decades, Percy Brown has worked as an educator, his core priority striving to address gaps in achievement between Black and white students.
There’s no single cause for those gaps, Brown says. Poor teaching methods are one factor, in his view. He points to changes in how reading is taught, for example, that have been shown to improve reading proficiency among white and Black students alike.
But, he contends, that’s only part of the answer. A legacy of discrimination through the generations demands more careful attention to making sure every student is fully welcome at the schoolhouse door and gets the opportunity to learn and thrive, he says, in the classroom and out.
Brown pursued that goal as the director of equity and student achievement in the Middleton School District, west of Madison, and more recently as a trainer and consultant on diversity and equity in education as well as a speaker on other education-related topics.
Biases about Black students’ inherent academic abilities persist, Brown contends — influencing not only white teachers but Black students as well.
“We’ve dealt with racial inferiority being placed on us and embedded in the psyche of all of America for a very, very long time,” Brown says. “And while we might have egalitarian beliefs, those stereotypes and biases are still there.”
Concern about that legacy drove Brown to write “Strength Through Generations” — a combination memoir, thumbnail sketch of Black history and call to action.
The book has more than one audience, Brown says. 
One audience is fellow educators — “to reach teachers, to help them be more culturally responsive in the classroom,” Brown says.
“I also wrote it for high school students that are African-American, so that they can learn more about their history, with the hope that that inspires them,” he says. “To know thyself is so key to what you’ll be able to do in life.”
DEI under attack
The book comes at a time when organized programs to address racial diversity, promote equity to overcome centuries of discrimination and subjugation, and promote inclusion of the broad range of people into national life and institutions are under fierce attack.
Starting on his first day in office President Donald Trump has issued a series of executive orders aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in federal government and education while also condemning inclusive policies in the private sector.
Brown has critiqued some of the ways DEI has been carried out. When he read an audit of Universities of Wisconsin DEI programs conducted by the Legislative Audit Bureau on behalf of the Legislature, he was struck that there seemed to be no consistent definition throughout the system for DEI.
But he also considers the anti-DEI wave a backlash to the protests in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd. “That woke up the world,” Brown says. “There was a coming together, and it wasn’t even politicized like that.”
Right-wing influencers began attacking critical race theory — a complex, academic concept — and subsequently DEI, he observes, deploying “the anti-woke rhetoric to really scare people.”
Six years earlier, however, in Middleton, “I was able to collaborate and get support from people on the right side of the aisle to try to make things better for historically disenfranchised students,” Brown says. “It wasn’t a boogie man.”
The book’s publication is especially timely, he believes.
“There’s a lot going on that I would say is just anti-‘We the people’ — unless you’re talking about ‘We the People’ in its original intent for this nation to be a nation for white people — and then nobody else,” Brown says.
Family history and Black history
Brown’s book weaves the stories of his grandfather’s involvement in the civil rights struggles in rural, segregated Mississippi and the lives of his father, aunts and uncles growing up there together with a primer on Black history.
“As a Black male educator with a background in social studies, I know that America’s schools focus heavily on teaching slavery, but this does not address the more significant curricular issue when it comes to the history of Black people,” Brown writes in the book’s introduction. “There’s no mention of ancient African civilizations, such as the Kingdoms of Mali, Songhai, Benin, Kemet, Nubia, Axum and Ethiopia.”
By teaching “a more comprehensive history of Black people,” he writes, educators can appropriately build self-esteem of Black children and also “change the perception of those who are not Black.”
Brown’s father, Percy Sr., and his father’s siblings integrated their local high school in Mississippi in 1965 after the district was forced to admit Black students. Ku Klux Klan members burned a cross at their home and fired gunshots. “The intimidation was real, as real as could be,” Percy Sr. told his son in an interview included in the book.
Finding common ground
His father moved north from Mississippi to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison, graduating in 1975. Percy Brown Jr. grew up in Madison, and his book reflects on the racial divisions then and now in the state’s capital city despite its progressive image.
When it came time to go to college, Brown attended Delta State University in Mississippi near where his father grew up.
A bout of spring cleaning helped trigger Brown’s idea to write the book. He turned up a paper he had written as an undergraduate in 1997 “about the need to incorporate Black history into the curriculum to help build the self-esteem of Black children,” he recalls. The paper concluded with his declaration that one day he would write a book about Black history to help meet that need.
Not long after finding the paper, he traveled to Egypt in 2023 to learn about the African roots of one of the world’s oldest civilizations — roots that Brown says have long been unappreciated.
“Going to Egypt — that was transformational for me, and in a lot of ways I think I felt more closely connected to the human family,” Brown says.
The final push for the book came from the CEO at a publishing firm that specializes in producing books by entrepreneurs.
While his book focuses on Black experience, Brown says that in his consulting work he sees parallel experiences in places where the population is all white or nearly so.
Conducting a student assembly (about being safe online) in Door County, he got a firsthand look at the way schools there are also under-resourced. “My empathy for them up there is no different than the empathy that I have for the Black kids here in the community,” Brown says.
He worries about polarization and what he calls the tribalism that divides the public.
“The things that we have in common, that’s how you start to build those authentic relationships,” Brown says. “That’s how you start to build community, right? And it’s about our collective shared stories — not shutting down one story.”

That was his core message to a diverse crowd that gathered Monday evening for a town hall on the outskirts of downtown Lansing.
The event at The Avenue, amid the whirring cacophony of pinball machines and arcade games, was just one of several stops in El Sayed’s early travels around the state as he seeks to garner support in next year’s Democratic U.S. Senate primary.
The contest will see him square off against U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, and research health specialist Rachel Howard. The winner will face Republican Mike Rogers of White Lake, the only GOP candidate on the other side of the race.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The contest remains in its earliest phases, and competition will likely grow fierce as the months wind down to 2026, but El Sayed is working to carve out a path for himself by taking on issues near and dear to progressive voters. 
In an interview with Michigan Advance, El Sayed, who previously ran for governor in 2018, said he hopes to build a campaign that isn’t about him or his own story, but about the people of Michigan and their struggles to simply exist in dire and newly uncertain times.
“That’s how movements grow. That’s how you build,” El Sayed said.

On Monday, the candidate’s crowd work and his campaign’s commitment to meeting people where they are were on full display. 
He also detailed his understanding of issues progressive voters want mentioned in the race – solutions to housing for marginalized people, fighting the scourge of corporate money in politics, taxing the wealthy to support more robust social safety nets and putting an end to what many, including Amnesty International, have called a genocide of the Palestinian people resulting from war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
El Sayed’s commentary and potential solutions to those problems are why he has an early supporter in Democratic state Rep. Emily Dievendorf of Lansing, who introduced El Sayed on Monday evening.
The representative had just attended a Lansing City Council meeting where they advocated for Lansing’s unhoused residents, and the moment was fresh in their mind.
“We should be advocating for the hardest hit among our neighbors. We should be fighting for the most vulnerable,” Dievendorf said. “When one person experiences instability, we all experience more instability.”

After some introduction and notes on why he believed his voice was needed in the U.S. Senate, El Sayed took questions from ardent supporters and first-time rally goers.
Fitting with the theme introduced by Dievendorf, one attendee mentioned the work to create and raise funds for an LGBTQ+ affirming homeless shelter in Lansing. They said it was difficult for unhoused transgender and queer people in the city to use traditional and typically religious options because those facilities might not accept them.
El Sayed was then asked about housing solutions for marginalized people.
As an Egyptian American, El Sayed said the question gets at the heart of engrained discrimination and its consequences.
“You should be able to have access to the basic means of a dignified life,” El Sayed said. “Too often, you get folks who come and say, ‘I want to stand with you and your community,’ but when it comes to the substance of standing with you, all of a sudden, they’re gone, nowhere to be found.”
El Sayed said marginalized people need meaningful support, and that means showing up when it matters and not when it’s easy. That includes state legislators, members of Congress and the U.S. Senate.
If elected, El Sayed said he would champion “real legislation” protecting LGBTQ+ people and those from all walks of life from discrimination in housing and health care.
He also warned about the intersection of homelessness and big technology, saying the country is facing a crisis where large capital is flexing its muscle in the real estate sector.
“Nobody’s ever thought of homelessness or housing as tech problems, but Airbnb and Vrbo are tech companies,” El Sayed said. “What they’ve enabled people with a little bit of excess capital to do is to buy up local real estate and then rent it on the market in ways that increase the price, and prices out local people all over the country.”
One way to prevent that, he said, was to engage more local developers who have a stake in their communities to build affordable housing that caters to those communities.
El Sayed asked supporters to take three actions before leaving that evening, but one stood out among the usual campaign requests. El Sayed asked attendees to reach out to people from whom they’ve become estranged in the wake of several elections that have divided families and friends.

The candidate told the crowd that it was necessary to rebuild those bonds if the progressive movement he’s championing was going to have any real chance at succeeding.
In his interview with the Advance, the candidate said one attendee told him that they were not quite ready to make those amends with members of their family who voted for Trump. 
El Sayed was moved by that person’s difficulty, and understood where they were coming from, but he remained unwavering in his belief that those ties could be mended. After all, restoring common ground between divided loved ones and friends was, at its core, a revolutionary and progressive act, he said.
“I’ve taken my fair share of hate. I know what that looks like, and I know how painful that is,” El Sayed said. “I just don’t know that we as a society can succeed if we’re not willing to meet hate with love, or fear with empathy. … Politics, at the end of the day, is about the emotional struggle around who we are and who we want to be.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8114712-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-12 06:57:40.395609

Facing a $1.8 million shortfall, city decides to make up for loss by cutting back on fertilizing, irrigating and otherwise maintaining public parks and landscaping.
The post Wyoming property tax relief prompts Casper to reduce maintenance of city parks appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—Several parks and other green spaces in Casper will see decreased mowing and associated maintenance this summer as a result of the property tax relief passed by the Wyoming Legislature earlier this year.
The city currently maintains 44 formal parks spanning about 120 acres, plus nearly 100 other landscaped areas, including street corners, street islands, lawns at city-owned buildings and more.
In years past, the city would mow and otherwise maintain those spaces on a weekly basis. However, after the 25% property tax exemption that followed additional cuts the prior year, maintenance at several locations will be cut back to every other week or eliminated.
“Combined with the 2024 cuts they passed last year, that includes the 50% property tax cut for long-term senior residents, this has resulted in a $1.8 million projected shortfall in the general fund that had to be reconciled for [the coming fiscal year],” Parks, Recreation and Public Services Director Zulima Lopez said. “While a $1.8 million shortfall is less than 1% of the total city budget, it represents more than 3% of the $56 million general fund, which is the fund that pays for daily operations like police, fire, streets and parks.”
Lopez said the city parks division is expected to save roughly $144,800 by cutting back park irrigation and fertilizing, as well as reducing various seasonal labor costs. Five seasonal employees were eliminated from the park maintenance operations budget in the proposed fiscal year 2026 budget.
Several factors were considered when deciding which areas would have reduced maintenance, including park popularity, any recent investments, whether there were shelters or other facilities on the site, burden on city staff and more. Lopez pointed to the grassy islands along CY Avenue as an example of a spot where the burden on workers was taken into account.
“CY Islands are difficult, even dangerous, for staff to access,” she said.

Among the locations to see reduced maintenance, the Casper Parks Division will reduce work at all city buildings except for Casper City Hall, where Lopez said landscaping was freshly installed in late 2024.
Park maintenance entails far more than just mowing, Lopez added. Crews also maintain park irrigation systems, fertilize, spray for weeds and perform upkeep on playground equipment. Parks to see reduced maintenance will see reductions in all work.
At a May work session of the Casper City Council, Lopez told councilors that she believes the reduction will have a noticeable and detrimental impact on the aesthetic appeal of the affected parks. She also said the reduced maintenance will likely have a negative effect on many city park rehabilitation projects.
“The longer we sustain reduced maintenance, the higher the cost to restore the turf areas will be,” Lopez said.
At the time, Councilor Amber Pollock suggested possibly cutting back on holiday lighting to leave more funding for maintenance.
“I would be in favor of eliminating [holiday lighting] entirely in favor of moving that funding to help us with turf, because that doesn’t have a potential cost impact to us later,” she said.

It's telling, columnist Kerry Drake writes, that the fired journalists at the eight shuttered newspapers immediately focused on the impact the closures would have on their readers and communities.
The post Wyoming’s newspaper closures threaten government accountability appeared first on WyoFile .","Losing a job in journalism can be soul-crushing. I know because I’ve lost a couple.

Opinion

When I read that eight local newspapers in Wyoming closed without warning last Wednesday, my thoughts immediately turned to the well-being of reporters and editors who saw their world spin out of control through no fault of their own.
It’s telling that when other journalists sought their reaction, these professionals suddenly experiencing the loss of paychecks and health insurance focused on how their layoffs will impact their readers and communities.
Evanston, Guernsey, Kemmerer, Lusk, Lyman, Pinedale, Torrington and Wheatland experienced a dramatic decrease in local news when the Illinois-based News Media Corporation — now there’s a generic name! — shut down its papers here and in four other states. Some journalists learned of their fate right before they were to print their weekly edition, so presses didn’t roll.
Cali O’Hare was managing editor of the Pinedale Roundup, which started publishing 120 years ago. “We’re going to see what we can do to fill the gap here in Sublette County to ensure that our community still has access to factual, reliable news, because we just can’t stomach the idea of just being OK with the news desert here,” she told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle.
There may be help coming that could allow some of the newspapers to reopen, but nothing was certain as of Sunday. O’Hare said a potential Roundup buyer has been found, and another group is reportedly interested in reopening the Platte County Record-Times, Torrington Telegram and Lusk Herald. But News Media Corporation has, according to sources involved in the situation, yet to respond to any offers.
“Most of us are concerned about the community,” Marie Hamilton, a reporter for the Record-Times and the Guernsey Gazette, told Cowboy State Daily. “These are our people. This is our home. It’s an honor of a lifetime to work in a rural community.”
What will readers do without their local paper? “Without us being the watchdog on a couple of boards here, what’s going to happen?” Hamilton replied. “How many more secret meetings are going to happen because the papers are down?”
More than one-third of the nation’s local newspapers have closed since 2005, typically shrinking newsrooms to a few employees and cutting costs to the bone before finally shutting the doors.


There is a whole body of research aimed at finding out how the issue is affecting residents and institutions like local governments. I like how comedian John Oliver once framed the issue on his “Last Week Tonight” TV show: “Not having reporters at government meetings is like a teacher leaving her room of 7th-graders to supervise themselves.”
“When police brutality spikes, when welfare offices deny claims, when local officials divert funds — these are the moments when communities need their journalists the most,” writes Abby Youran Qin in the Milwaukee Independent.
Without journalistic scrutiny, Qin adds, “scholars find that mismanagement flourishes, corruption costs balloon, and the communities most vulnerable to abuse receive the least accountability. This is how news deserts exacerbate inequality.”
Newspapers are critical for informing the public about political candidates and their beliefs.. Without that information, voters may stay home on election day — or go to the polls unprepared.
Newspapers are also essential for keeping residents informed about the policies mulled by their local governments. Without them, people may not know about a controversy until it’s already been decided. Without a paper’s opinion section, there are no letters to the editor, commentaries or forums, and the public becomes less empowered and less able to influence public policy.
Way back in 2011, the Federal Communications Commission had a bleak forecast in the wake of then-unprecedented newspaper closures: “More government waste, more local corruption, less effective schools, and other serious community problems.” It’s all happened.
Researchers at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Illinois at Chicago examined the impact of local newspaper closures on public finance. “Local newspapers hold their governments accountable, keeping municipal borrowing costs low and ultimately saving local taxpayers money,” the study found.
Here’s a non-economic cost: Who will continue the legacy of reporting the history of towns like Lusk, where the Herald has been published since 1886, four years before Wyoming Territory was granted statehood?
It’s a job done by fewer people since small local newsrooms began cutting employees to keep afloat. The Pinedale Roundup absorbed the Sublette Examiner, then O’Hare became the only employee when the owner laid off two reporters.
In a Wyoming Public Radio broadcast last October, Melodie Edwards profiled O’Hare and her difficulties covering a story that made international headlines. A man brought a muzzled, injured wolf he’d run over with a snowmobile and paraded it through a Sublette County bar before killing it.
While out-of-state reporters were parachuting in to capture the local flavor and quickly departing, O’Hare’s job was infinitely harder. Other journalists didn’t have to deal with county officials, who are also her neighbors, pressuring her to stop reporting the story, which she related to Edwards.
O’Hare’s reporting helped shape local and state opinion, including legislative discussions that culminated in a new offense for torturing, tormenting, mutilating or causing undue suffering to wildlife — including predatory animals and birds — that have been taken into possession.
Edwards ended her story with this observation: “While lots of other papers publish more and more press releases and national stories, [O’Hare] planned to keep writing original, locally-focused stories. That means the Pinedale Roundup won’t become a ghost paper anytime soon.”
But that’s precisely what happened less than a year later in eight Wyoming towns.
Local governments will be far less accountable. Fewer people will vote, and the newspapers that gave the public a voice have been silenced. Corporate journalism is beholden to out-of-state owners like News Media Corporation, not people who worked for them — and certainly not the public.
These are tense times for all American newspapers trying to hold on, particularly small operations in rural areas. I hope new offers will be accepted by the Illinois owner and presses can roll again. But until that happens, the best contribution Wyomingites can make is supporting local papers across the state any way they can.

(Jarvis DeBerry/Louisiana Illuminator)A review of how Louisiana keeps its Medicaid rolls up to date found the state paid out benefits for more than 1,000 people over the past six years after they died. Nearly $10 million was paid to managed care organizations over that period, even though no health care services were actually provided.
The Louisiana Legislative Auditor conducted its study as part of Gov. Jeff Landry’s Fiscal Responsibility Program, which he has branded LA DOGE. It looked specifically at how state health officials keep track of when Medicaid beneficiaries die and whether outside data sources could help that process. 
When auditors used those additional sources, they found 1,072 beneficiaries who died between February 2019 and March 2025 and approximately $9.6 million spent collectively on their Medicaid coverage. Auditors said the actual spending figure is higher because their calculations only included dental coverage payments – and not health coverage – for the final eight months reviewed.

According to the audit report, the Louisiana Department of Health relies on federal and state data sources to identify dead Medicaid beneficiaries. They include Louisiana Vital Records, the Social Security Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the state Department of Children and Family Services and the managed care organizations the state pays to deliver Medicaid offerings.
For its analysis, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s staff also used obituaries and identified 511 dead Medicaid beneficiaries the state missed in its reviews. Payouts to managed care organizations for this group totaled $5.22 million over the six-year period, and the median time between the beneficiary’s death and the most recent monthly payout to their managed care provider was more than 20 months.
Auditors found 168 more deceased Medicaid beneficiaries through the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File, a source the state health department has not used. The median time between the beneficiary’s death and the latest payment in this group was almost 800 days, according to the audit.   
The Legislative Auditor recommended the Louisiana Department of Health determine whether it should use third-party data sources as part of its eligibility determination process to identify deceased Medicaid beneficiaries. Out of the $9.6 million Louisiana paid for Medicaid services never provided, the audit identified $7.6 million through third-party sources.    
In his July 30 response to the Legislative Auditor, state Health Secretary Doug Greenstein agreed with the audit’s recommendation and said his department was “in the process of working with the U.S. Department of Treasury to gain the necessary approvals to receive the Social Security Administration Death Master File.” 
The health department was presented with the auditor’s findings in May. In June, approximately $4 million in state payments to Medicaid managed care organizations were to be withheld to recoup part of the money paid on behalf of dead beneficiaries, the audit report said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A University of Nebraska regent faces a felony charge for allegedly driving while under the influence of alcohol and crashing into another vehicle in mid-May, breaking the back and pelvis of a passenger in the other car.
NU Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, 34, a former Douglas County deputy county attorney serving in her seventh year as a regent, is accused of a DUI causing serious bodily injury from the night of May 21 in Omaha’s Benson neighborhood, which is in O’Connor’s district. The Class IIIA felony charge carries a maximum of three years in prison and 18 months post-release supervision.
The severity of the allegation could impact whether O’Connor can serve. The Nebraska Constitution bars felons from holding public office unless the person’s civil rights are restored by the Nebraska Board of Pardons, which consists of the governor, secretary of state and attorney general.
Neither O’Connor nor her attorney has yet addressed her future as a regent, a position to which she was reelected to a 6-year term in November.
Alleged May 21 incident
According to police reports, O’Connor was driving her Subaru Outback east on Blondo Street about 8:33 p.m., when she crossed into the westbound lane and collided with a Ford Focus at the intersection of N 63rd and Blondo Streets. 
Police said they found a half-empty bottle of Fireball Whisky in O’Connor’s vehicle and wrote that she was showing symptoms of intoxication, including bloodshot or watery eyes, slurred speech and alcohol on her breath.

Field sobriety tests confirmed her condition, the investigator wrote, and a blood test collected immediately after the crash indicated O’Connor had a blood alcohol concentration of four times the legal limit: 0.321%.
Both vehicles were totaled, according to the accident report. The crash occurred minutes of O’Connor’s home. 
The vehicle police say her car hit had five passengers in it, including three children. The driver and children sustained minor injuries, according to the police report. The woman seriously injured in the crash and O’Connor, who had minor injuries, were taken to the Nebraska Medical Center.
O’Connor declined to comment for this story, and her attorney could not be reached. The family involved in the crash also declined to comment when reached by the Nebraska Examiner. Two listed witnesses did not return calls seeking comment. A spokesperson for the University of Nebraska system said NU “does not comment on ongoing legal matters.”
Douglas County Attorney’s Office
It took two months to file charges, partly because of O’Connor’s employment as a civil attorney in the Douglas County Attorney’s Office until last Tuesday, when she resigned, the timing of which the County Attorney’s Office confirmed.
Omaha’s top prosecutors opted out of the case involving O’Connor, citing a potential conflict of interest. That left Omaha City Prosecutor Kevin Slimp to file the felony charge in Douglas County Court on July 30. 
Slimp told the Examiner a key reason for the delay was waiting for the blood test to come back from the lab. The police report was amended July 22 to include the BAC results. Slimp said he also needed time to review the evidence.

Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine defended O’Connor a day before she resigned, telling the Omaha World-Herald she had “been an exemplary employee for our office.” He also described what happened as “something that is terrible and needs to be addressed.”
O’Connor, a 2015 graduate from Notre Dame Law School, told the local paper through her attorney last week that she decided to resign “after much reflection and support from trusted colleagues.”
“While I am proud of my work serving Douglas County, I do not want my pending legal matter to serve as a distraction from the fine work and service the Douglas County Attorney’s Office continues to provide our community,” she said in the statement.
O’Connor was booked into the Douglas County Department of Corrections at 9:31 p.m. on July 31. She appeared before a judge the following morning. A county official confirmed she was released after posting 10% of a $25,000 bond around 7 p.m. on Aug. 1. 
As a condition of her release, O’Connor must participate in Douglas County’s 24/7 Sobriety Program with daily monitoring and drug testing.
The Douglas County Court, with agreement from the prosecution and defense, waived a stipulation that O’Connor stay within 10 miles of the county. O’Connor’s next court date is Sept. 9 in Douglas County Court.
‘Everything she can to make it right’
NU Regent Paul Kenney, a Republican of Amherst and chair of the NU Board of Regents, said he would be as supportive as he could to O’Connor while not commenting on the criminal case.
“Just trying to be a friend and a colleague and do what I can to help,” Kenney said Monday.

Kenney and NU Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha, who joined O’Connor on the board in 2019, told the Examiner that O’Connor has been through a tough time recently in her personal life, which Weitz described as a “year in hell.”
O’Connor was the youngest regent elected to the NU board in 2018, at 28 years old, and is one of just a handful of women to serve.
Weitz said the situation breaks her heart and that O’Connor “takes responsibility for making a bad choice, but she’s also doing everything she can to make it right.” Weitz said she remains supportive of O’Connor and that it is “imperative” that NU keep her as a regent. 
Second chances

The board is officially nonpartisan, and regents are often unanimous in their votes, but the party breakdown on the board is 6 Republicans and 2 Democrats. O’Connor and Weitz are the two Democrats. 
In seven years — across hundreds of votes — only once has the board split 6-2 along party lines. That was in April, when the regents amended NU bylaws to try to comply with an order from President Donald Trump’s administration against higher education diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Weitz and O’connor opposed the changes.
O’Connor stands out among elected regents as having first served as a student body president and student regent for the University of Nebraska at Omaha, one of four students who serve in advisory roles to the board. She graduated from UNO in 2012.
Weitz described O’Connor as an “outstanding” regent, an “excellent” attorney and someone who has NU’s best interests in mind.
“Of all the people I know who deserve second chances, she tops the list,” Weitz said Monday. “We’d lose a great deal if we lose her.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)With groundwater in parts of eastern Washington declining at an alarming rate, a new study confirms which areas are most vulnerable to the problem and could help set clearer goals for recovery efforts.
The Washington State University study evaluated groundwater levels throughout the Washington portion of the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System, which spans areas of Washington, Oregon and Idaho, and supplies up to a third of the region’s irrigation water.
Severe drought causing Utah reservoir levels to drop at ‘concerning’ rate

Researchers found that the Odessa region and the Yakima Basin in eastern Washington are seeing groundwater levels drop by at least 2 to 3 feet per year. The declines in those areas are primarily attributed to a combination of groundwater overuse and climate variability.
“This gives a quantitative target of how much water needs to be either put back into the ground or needs to be managed around to bring us back to some sort of steady condition,” said Sasha McLarty, study author and associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Washington State University
The Washington state Department of Ecology estimates that groundwater supplies drinking water to over 60% of Washington residents.
 Odessa region shows most significant groundwater level decrease

Most municipalities have groundwater wells, and rural residents typically have wells on their properties, according to Jaime Short, section manager for the department’s Eastern Regional Office.
In eastern Washington, Short said, groundwater is primarily used for irrigated agriculture.
The Odessa region showed the most significant groundwater level decreases over the largest geographic area in Washington. The study notes that groundwater is the main water supply for the Odessa area.
If groundwater levels continue to decrease at their current rate, the Odessa region will likely lose 10% of accessible groundwater by 2040 and 50% within the next 70 years, according to the study.
The Yakima Basin showed steep declines in the deepest aquifer layer, making it more difficult to address the groundwater loss, McLarty said.
The study confirms what the Department of Ecology and local stakeholders have known for decades, said Department of Ecology hydrogeologist Chris Beard.
“Where it’s declining, it’s been declining for a long time,” Beard said.
 Mitigating declines in groundwater levels

In general, communities in areas where groundwater levels are dropping have already initiated efforts to mitigate and reverse the decline, Beard said.
The Department of Ecology and communities that depend on the Odessa Subarea Aquifer have been aware of declining groundwater levels since the 1960s, according to Smith.
A consortium of state, local and federal partners has been working since 2013 on a project to swap groundwater with surface water supplies from the Columbia River for agricultural users, so they can eventually stop using their wells.
The Odessa Groundwater Replacement Program secured nearly $45 million in this year’s capital budget to build a new irrigation system.
The project has so far eliminated the use of 16 wells and conserved 5.3 billion gallons of water annually in the Odessa Subarea Aquifer.
In the Yakima Basin, state, federal, tribal, business, and community organizations partnered in 2009 to develop the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan, which established a 30-year resource management strategy for the basin.
 Positive groundwater trends in areas of Spokane, the Lower Snake River and Klickitat

Of the 15 subareas in Washington included in the study, 12 showed groundwater levels dropping every year, while three — Spokane, the Lower Snake River and Klickitat — were found to be gaining water.
The positive trends in those areas are primarily due to active management and monitoring efforts, according to McLarty.
2024 settlement agreement protects most Idaho water users from curtailment, state says

While communities that know they’re losing groundwater have taken action to mitigate that loss, there are significant gaps in groundwater level data around the state.
“Our groundwater data measurements are actually pretty clustered in certain areas, so there are large parts of the state where we simply don’t have data,” Short said.
Most of those data gaps are in areas that are not heavily populated, according to Short.
Filling in those data gaps so researchers can track groundwater trends statewide over time is a goal for the Department of Ecology, Short said. The Washington State University study was part of the ongoing effort to do so.
It emerged from a legislatively-mandated project established in 2006, which calls for an estimate of current and future water supply and demand to be collected every five years.
This year’s study was the first to incorporate an observation-based analysis across the whole Columbia Basin Aquifer, McLarty said.
That strategy allowed researchers to document trends in different geographic areas of Washington, as well as trends within different layers of the aquifer, to better pinpoint where water is available and where it’s declining.
The study was also the first to take well infrastructure into account when determining what areas are vulnerable to groundwater loss.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)After having provided unwavering support to programs that will prove harmful to our state and nation, Idaho’s top elected officials have found themselves in full-spin mode. Our Congressional delegation, although largely avoiding direct contact with voters in open town halls, have been using the Congressional recess to spin the effect of MAGA programs they supported.
Congressman Mike Simpson has been the most disappointing. As Idaho attorney general, I supported Mike’s run for the Idaho Legislature in 1984. He served honorably and intelligently for 14 years and has served in the U.S. House since 1989. Mike has done some good work over the years, at least until the Trump regime took over America’s government. Mike has become a loyal Trump sycophant in the House.
How Congress’s megabill will impact Idaho: Cuts to taxes, Medicaid, SNAP and more

In an Aug. 5 talk to the Idaho Falls Chamber of Commerce, Simpson lauded his support for the recently-passed “Big Beautiful Billionaire Bill”(BBBB). The bill extends forever the large tax cuts enacted in 2017, which were heavily skewed to the rich. 
Simpson blew off the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculation that the BBBB will add $3.5 trillion to America’s national debt, bringing our indebtedness to around 40 trillion dollars. Simpson claimed the “CBO is never right.” It is rather strange that Simpson placed reliance on the CBO cost estimate of the Fiscal Responsibility Act in 2023. The well-regarded Bipartisan Policy Center has verified the CBO determination.
Simpson continually wails about the ever-increasing national debt. His website says:
“The impact of an ever increasing national debt, if allowed to grow unchecked, can be disastrous for the economy. I am especially concerned that future generations of Americans will probably be the ones expected to pay down this debt.” His support for BBBB’s billionaire tax relief apparently takes priority over those future generations. Simpson bemoaned that “the biggest payment we make today is interest on the national debt, over a trillion dollars.” The BBBB will substantially increase that payment.
Simpson also wants to finance tax relief for the wealthy by cutting “wasteful Medicaid spending for illegal migrants and people who can work but refuse to.” He doesn’t seem to know that undocumented migrants cannot receive Medicaid assistance, except in limited emergency situations. 
And most adult Medicaid recipients are already working. According to reliable KFF research, “nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19-64 covered by Medicaid were working and nearly three in 10 were not working because of caregiving responsibilities, illness or disability, or due to school attendance.”  
Congressman Russ Fulcher, the most subservient member of Idaho’s MAGA delegation, enthusiastically supported the BBBB, even though his website says that America’s “escalating debt trajectory is unsustainable and poses significant risks to future generations.” Fulcher is the only member of the delegation who declined to oppose the sale of public lands in Idaho.
U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo almost got themselves crosswise with the great majority of Idahoans by supporting a MAGA effort to sell public lands as part of the BBBB deliberations. When they saw that both of Montana’s Republican senators were against land sales and that most Idahoans hate the idea, they did a quick about face.
They both voted for the massive tax relief for the rich and for substantial cuts to medical care and nutrition assistance for struggling Idahoans. Sen. Crapo was the person who gave Simpson and other MAGA members of Congress the preposterous idea that the BBBB would not increase the national debt. Crapo used smoke-and-mirrors economics to reach that result. Both Risch and Crapo vociferously oppose spending that increases the national debt, but that must only apply when others do it.
The other MAGA problem facing Idaho and the rest of the nation is the chaotic tariff dance being conducted by Donald Trump. Congress has the constitutional authority for setting the country’s tariff policy, as well as controlling the nation’s purse strings. The MAGA Congress has completely abdicated its power and obligation on both counts. Trump unlawfully withholds spending on programs authorized by Congress and arbitrarily imposes tariffs that will hit American consumers in their pocketbooks. All of this goes on without a peep from our petrified MAGA delegation.
An Idaho businesswoman met with Sen. Crapo to outline the damage that Trump tariffs were wreaking on her business. He told her there was little he could do to help; his hands were tied because the president was going it alone. Crapo may have forgotten that he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax and trade policy. He certainly has the power to stop her pain.
Crapo and the rest of Idaho’s congressional delegation lack the courage to stand up for their state and country. Rather than fulfill their sacred oath to stand up for constitutional government, they spend their time spinning the destructive MAGA program. Perhaps it’s time for voters to put them out to pasture.

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely | West Virginia Watch)In Morgantown, volunteers have been using federal emergency funds to put people and families — typically single mothers and their children — in hotels, helping them avoid sleeping in their cars or on the streets.
The Ramp Hotel program has been almost exclusively funded by a federal emergency food and shelter program, which is now frozen by the Trump administration. The program is under review to ensure compliance with the president’s executive orders and new guidelines. 
Volunteers with the Ramp Hotel say that, following the federal funding freeze earlier this year,  they only have enough money to cover a few more hotel rooms for people who are on the verge of homelessness.
“We’re not dealing with dollars and cents here. We’re dealing with human dignity,” said Zac Morton, a pastor who co-founded the Ramp Hotel program in 2021. “To make cuts that directly take away tools that are helping the most vulnerable people in our populations, is essentially saying we don’t care about them.”
After paying for 795 nights of hotel stays, the program’s other co-founder, Brian Butcher, recently changed his voicemail to say the program will soon have to stop.
The Ramp Hotel program serves individuals who typically have nowhere else to go because local shelters are full or they’re unable to stay in a traditional shelter.
“There were always people who slipped through the cracks of the established emergency shelter program for all sorts of reasons,” Morton said. “Sometimes there were health concerns. Sometimes it was about keeping a family together.” 
Butcher said they most commonly help single mothers with kids, some who have ended up in Morgantown for medical appointments at the children’s hospital and don’t have a way to get home. 
“There is room for families in our current shelter, but it’s always full,” said Butcher, who serves as deputy mayor of Morgantown. He recalled getting a hotel room for a mom who was living in her car with seven children. 
“There’s a big gap we’re trying to fill,” he said.

The program works with local social service providers to first try to put people in traditional shelter spaces. Butcher and Morton recently provided a hotel stay for a family who lost their home to a fire and were waiting on an insurance check.
The Ramp Hotel program has been funded almost exclusively through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) emergency food and shelter program. The funds have been indefinitely frozen since January as part of the broader halt on federal funding.
“This is our steady funding source that actually makes sure that we can do the program,” Butcher said. 
Because the Ramp Hotel program is run on a volunteer basis, Morton said that all of their federal funding has been used to pay for hotel rooms and food gift cards. He and Butcher spent around $17,000 last fiscal year on 269 hotel room nights and 288 meals.
Local United Way organizations have often doled out the federal emergency food and shelter program funds to organizations addressing homelessness. Courtney Summers, community impact director for the United Way of Monongalia and Preston Counties, said they’re waiting to hear about when the federal dollars will be available.
The Ramp Hotel program doesn’t receive any state funding.

After starting the program with their own funds, Butcher and Morton said they’d now have to find completely new funding sources to keep the program running. They don’t think community donations would come in at the level they need.
Morton, who pastors First Presbyterian Church in Morgantown, said the program has less than $1,000 left in funding. He noted his program dissolving ultimately just puts more work and financial strain on Morgantown’s other homeless service providers. 
“We’ve helped keep people in a situation where they can stay sober. We’ve helped people get in a situation where they can find some stability and get a little bit of time before they find permanent housing,” Morton said. “To not have that just means that we have more people in more dire situations with less options than we had before.
He continued, “There are citizens in West Virginia who want to take care of each other, but we need to be cooperating with our governments to resource those kinds of efforts.”

Ken Yager of East Tennessee pleaded no contest Monday to drunk driving in Jekyll Island, Georgia, where he was arrested late last year on multiple charges.
Yager, 78, a Kingston lawmaker who serves as chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus, entered the plea through his attorney to the misdemeanor charge of DUI Less Safe, some nine months after his December 2024 arrest in affluent Glynn County, Georgia.
The court dismissed charges of hit and run, duty of a driver to stop or return to the scene of an accident, and failure to yield, according to a statement from Yager. The senator said he had completed 40 hours of community service and attended DUI school as part of the plea agreement in which he neither denied nor admitted guilt but accepted the punishment.
Yager expressed regret and apologized for the incident and said he failed to live up to his personal and professional principles, letting down his family, friends and constituents.
Sen. Ken Yager faces DUI, hit-and-run charges after Georgia arrest

“I take full responsibility for my actions on December 3rd. Drinking and driving is a very serious matter. It will never happen again,” Yager said in a statement.
The day of his arrest, Georgia state troopers were notified that a Ford Edge with Tennessee plates was allegedly involved in a hit-and-run incident on Jekyll Island. Troopers found the vehicle in a market parking lot of the beach resort town where emergency personnel were evaluating Yager, who tripped and fell, police reported.
DUI Less Safe is a charge of driving under the influence in which the prosecution can contend the motorist’s ability to drive was impaired even though their blood-alcohol content could be below the legal limit of .08%. Yager’s blood-alcohol content was recorded at .14%, and he refused a blood test after being arrested, according to the police report.
Yager told troopers he was involved in a crash earlier but that he thought everyone was OK and after talking to the other driver, he decided to leave the scene, not knowing police were en route, according to the incident report. He told officers he had drunk a couple of glasses of wine earlier in the day.
Because he pleaded to a misdemeanor charge rather than a felony, the lawmaker would not be subject to the Senate’s rules for expulsion.

(Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Increased restrictions on eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, introduced in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law — known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill  — could put a universal free school meal program at risk for New Orleans public school students.
SNAP, previously known as food stamps, provides grocery benefits to low-income households, increasing access to healthy foods. But the program, which is administered at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, also pays for in-school meals. Being enrolled in SNAP allows kids to automatically qualify for free school meals, reducing paperwork burdens for both school administrators and parents. Enrollment in other federal assistance programs, including Medicaid and Head Start, also directly qualify children for free meals.
The spending cuts to SNAP included in the bill, which Trump signed into law last month, are estimated to total $186 million over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Like the cuts to Medicaid included in the law, those savings are achieved through administrative adjustments — which will likely result in lower enrollment — rather than direct funding cuts to the program.

Changes to program eligibility — such as increased work requirements and restrictions on noncitizen enrollment — will result in fewer adults and children enrolled in the program, according to Erin Hysom, a senior child and nutrition policy analyst with the Food Research and Action Center.
“SNAP provides a direct link between eligible children and free school meals,” Hysom said. “Cutting SNAP severs that link, resulting in increased paperwork burdens on schools and families and ultimately causing eligible children to fall through the cracks.”
Lower enrollment could jeopardize schools’ ability to participate in a government-funded universal free meal program, called the Community Eligibility Provision, in which the vast majority of schools across the state and in the city of New Orleans now participate.
Under the Community Eligibility Provision, when a certain percentage of low-income students directly qualify for free meals, all students at a school can enjoy free breakfast and lunch without being enrolled in SNAP themselves. In 2023, the United States Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP and other nutrition programs, lowered the percentage of students needed to qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision from 40% to 25%. The rule took effect during the 2024-2025 school year, resulting in a surge of participating districts, according to a report to the Food Research and Action Center, which found that about 27.2 million students attended a participating school last school year, up 3.6 million from the year before.

Around 22% of New Orleans residents receive SNAP benefits. But over 90% of New Orleans public schools participate in the Community Eligibility Provision, the Food Research and Action Center found. In all but one of the participating schools, over 50% of students qualify for free lunches. But as cuts to Medicaid and SNAP are expected to take place over the next few years, that percentage of students might decrease, threatening all students’ automatic access to free meals.
Hysom said that the potential loss of free meal programs in schools will lead to increased stigma, higher school meal debt and more hunger in classrooms that lowers learning outcomes.
“We like to say that community eligibility creates hunger-free schools because CEP reduces the stigma that is often present in cafeterias when we categorize children by their household income,” Hysom said.
Brenda Watson, the business manager and director of food service at Fannie C. Williams Charter School in New Orleans East, which is enrolled for Community Eligibility Provision benefits, agreed. Last school year, 85% of the school’s students were on SNAP, Watson said.
“Most of the kids are thinking about survival,” Watson said. “This may be the best meal that they would get for that day. And so we try to recognize those kids. So just imagine if you’re asking them to pay, and they were already on SNAP, and food stamps. They don’t have money to pay, so you’re going to cut off everything that they have.”
Watson said she is concerned about cuts to federal programs that she learns about through the news, but that the state hasn’t passed down any information about cuts to SNAP specifically. She said the school relies on the state to transfer information about how federal grants will affect schools to administrators.
Danyelle Christmas, a parent from the Lower 9th Ward, received SNAP benefits for most of her childhood, and was again briefly enrolled in the program last year. (Christmas is currently running for the District E seat on the New Orleans City Council in the fall municipal elections.) She said the benefits she received helped keep her family afloat as her weekly grocery bills reached $150. Even though she doesn’t receive SNAP benefits anymore, Christmas said that free meals at her children’s daycare help ease burdens at home.
“So if funding is cut for the daycare, then now I may have to wake up early at 4:30 in the morning, and I’ll prepare breakfast, and it’s more draining on the parent and the household,” Christmas said. “So it trickles down in every which way possible, affecting everybody.”

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.











Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School



In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

LOUISVILLE — Ford Motor Company will invest nearly $2 billion to convert a longtime auto manufacturing plant in Louisville to build electric vehicles from a new platform adaptable to multiple vehicle types, aiming to launch a mid-sized EV pickup truck by 2027.
Ford President and CEO Jim Farley told an audience of plant workers, local and state elected officials and other representatives Monday inside the Louisville Assembly Plant that moving forward with the  “universal” EV platform was a risk, especially with global EV competition, but the company was investing in the future.
“We needed a rapid approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle that delights customers in every way that matters,” Farley said. “We need to do it and be sustainable and make money, and we need to do it with American workers.”
Farley and other Ford executives said the EV truck would be priced starting at $30,000, would have an “amazing range” and be built through a newly designed assembly line to be created at the Louisville plant. The EV batteries for the new platform will be supplied from a Michigan battery plant. The new truck will have 20% fewer parts compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, allowing for significantly quicker assembly line production. The more efficient assembly line for electric vehicles, these executives said, would also mean less physical strain workers and less getting in and out of vehicles.
Farley was joined on stage by Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who lauded the “massive investment” in the state. A release from Beshear’s office states Ford’s plant conversion would be the third largest economic development project in Kentucky’s history.

“This cutting-edge platform will be the foundation for the next generation of vehicles. The best part is, these vehicles will be affordable,” Beshear said. “They’re going to help so many American families keep more money in their pockets for groceries, medicine, school supplies and yes, even that family vacation.”
Leaders with United Auto Workers Local 862, representing workers at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant and Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville said the newly designed assembly line for electric vehicles would cause some plant workers to lose their jobs in Louisville and have to take jobs at another Ford operation. The Louisville Assembly Plant currently builds two SUVs, the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.
“It’s not nearly as drastic as they expected when they first came at us talking about an EV,” said Brandon Reisinger, the Louisville Assembly Plant building chair for the union. “I don’t foresee anybody hitting the street at all. I don’t know that our working number will be exactly the same it is now, but nobody’s gonna get laid off.”
  Brandon Reisinger with United Auto Workers Local 862 said he believed the low cost of charging electric vehicles can be convincing to consumers. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
Reisinger told reporters some of the work done elsewhere to preassemble cars before they arrive at the plant will be done at the plant with the new EV, offsetting the downsizing. He estimates the plant’s workforce will be about a couple hundred fewer people when the plant conversation is complete, also accounting for people who retire. Ford executives said 2,200 jobs at the plant will be “secured” with the conversion; about 3,300 workers are employed at the plant as of 2024, according to Ford.
Reisinger said he believes the conversion could begin at the end of the year with some workers temporarily unemployed during a few months of the conversion, but the union’s contract provides for supplemental unemployment benefits to workers worth about 80% of a paycheck.
When asked about political headwinds against electric vehicles from elected officials in the federal and state governments Reisinger pointed to the lower cost of charging an EV compared to filling up a gas tank as a compelling reason for EVs.
“I’m going to end up buying me one of these as well when we start building,” Reisinger said. “It’s going to be a very cost-effective vehicle to drive.”

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)“Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,” said Donald Trump when he accepted the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. 
In just one presidential campaign, Trump bifurcated the Republican Party, built a movement on a foundation of purported populism and promised to advocate for frustrated Americans who felt their government had let them down. Almost a decade has passed, and Tennessee’s elected Republicans have fully embraced Trump, copying and pasting his messaging and claiming to stand up for everyday Tennesseans.
However, a closer look at the 940-page “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (for which every Republican member of Tennessee’s federal delegation voted) provides evidence for how Trump’s movement is just a rebranded version of the same old GOP: a political party that will go to the mat for the wealthy while abandoning working-class voters.
What will the bill cost Tennesseans? On healthcare costs and related job loss
According to KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization, around 68,000 Tennesseans will lose access to federally subsidized healthcare due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s changes to the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) marketplace health insurance programs. The U.S. House Democrats’ Joint Economic Committee predicts more than double that number, or 170,000 Tennesseans, will lose coverage.
“Big Beautiful Bill” cuts to Medicaid, food aid raise alarm in Tennessee

KFF estimates another 45,000 Tennesseans will lose access to Medicaid as a result of the measure’s $7 billion in cuts to TennCare, Tennessee’s Medicaid program, over the next decade. The Joint Economic Committee says closer to 70,000 will lose Medicaid. Between ACA and Medicaid cuts, at least 110,000 Tennesseans are expected to lose healthcare due to the Big Beautiful Bill.
The cuts will have the greatest impact on rural communities. Nearly half of all rural hospitals in Tennessee operate at a loss, so cuts to Medicaid funding, which helps keep these hospitals operating, will be devastating, especially considering Tennessee already has the highest number of rural hospital closures per capita in the nation. 
Rural communities account for approximately 21% of the state’s population, or around 1.5 million Tennesseans. Far from Tennessee’s big cities, it is in these communities where the local hospital is often the best option for a good-paying job. When the hospital leaves, so do the jobs, triggering harmful economic ripple effects. According to one report, at least nine rural Tennessee hospitals are on the chopping block.
On nutrition assistance and related job loss
About 77% of Tennessee households currently receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) already have someone in the household who is working, but Trump’s bill makes access to SNAP even more difficult by significantly increasing work requirements (including for single mothers and the elderly) while simultaneously making the implementation of SNAP more expensive for everyone. 
How did he pull that off? A provision of the legislation requires states to pay 75% of SNAP’s administrative costs by 2028 (up from 50%), meaning the Tennessee legislature will have to pull funds from another program or increase taxes on working Tennesseans to keep SNAP operating in the state.
SNAP is an economic driver in Tennessee (for every dollar spent on SNAP, about $1.50 is generated in Gross Domestic Product), so reductions to SNAP won’t just threaten food security for the most vulnerable among us: it will also come back to bite working Tennesseans on the employment side. Because the program employs agriculture and food retail workers, SNAP cuts in Tennessee will likely result in some job losses, especially in rural, agricultural communities.
On energy costs and related job loss
The Biden presidency’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) reduced energy costs and added jobs. Tennessee and other states won by Trump benefited the most from the growth of the clean energy economy, receiving 77% of the IRA investments made thus far and 78% of the jobs created thus far. Yet the Big Beautiful Bill does away with almost all clean energy investments, resulting in the loss of 530,000 jobs and the cancellation of $380 billion in planned clean energy investments.
Tennessee is in the top five states predicted to suffer the largest electricity price increases as a direct result of the new measure. According to the Center for American Progress, Tennesseans can expect electricity price increases greater than $200 by 2026.
Three charts showing the impact of the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ on Tennessee

On the jobs side, since 2022, Tennessee has enjoyed over 6,000 new clean energy jobs thanks to the IRA’s energy credits. The bill’s disruption to those credits could threaten jobs and undermine Tennessee’s efforts towards producing clean, affordable energy.
How will the bill benefit Tennesseans?
Trump supporters justify the bill’s sweeping cuts to healthcare, nutritional support and the clean energy economy by promising Americans lower taxes. And yes, an examination of U.S. Census household income data reveals that Tennessee may be on track to receive as much as $7 billion in income tax cuts in 2026. But who will benefit from the cuts? 
About 31% of the $7 billion in tax cuts will go to Tennessee households that make between $100,000 and $200,000 per year, even though those households represent only 24.1% of the state’s population. A whopping 45.8% of the $7 billion will go to Tennessee households that make more than $200,000 per year, even though those households represent just 8.6% of the population. Barely 20% of the tax cuts will go to working-class households making between $40,000 and $100,000 per year, despite those households representing the largest population demographic in the state.
Politicians have been selling out working-class Americans and serving the interests of the ultra-wealthy for generations. Tennessee’s elected officials are no different. Voters must put aside their cultural, often single-issue differences and work together to choose better candidates.

Josh Hawley, at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 20, 2024 (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images).Before the leader of one of the most respected immigrant-rights organizations in the nation could get on a flight and come to Missouri, she was issued a threat by one of the state’s politicians.
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley targeted Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), in June.
Hawley sent her a letter, questioning if the California organization she leads was “aiding and abetting criminal conduct.” Specifically, the claim was that her organization was “bankrolling civil unrest.”
Hawley’s letter blamed Salas for widespread protests in Los Angeles, the city’s pushback against immigration raids.
The senator demanded that CHIRLA provide a slew of records — emails, texts, media talking points, donor lists, strategies and any financial records of money that might have been spent in protesting the immigration raids carried out by Homeland Security and other federal agencies.
She came to Kansas City anyway.
Nation’s largest Latino civil rights organization meets in KC against backdrop of mass deportations

On Aug. 5, Salas was a speaker at the UnidosUS convention, the largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the nation. Of all the invited participants, she drew the most fervent applause, second only to UnidosUS President and CEO, Janet Murguia.
Murguia is from Kansas City, Kansas, and comes from a well-known family with deep commitments to public service.
Salas’ session was packed, standing room only at the large convention center. She spoke boldly, unequivocally, detailing how in early June CHIRLA began hearing community reports of men, women and some children being held in the basement of a federal building because space had run out in the municipal detention center.
Raids were being conducted across L.A., she said, with federal agents taking people into custody suspecting that they were undocumented.
“We never imagined what was to come,” Salas said. “Our city was overtaken by a federal immigration military force of masked men in military convoys with automatic rifles and other armaments of war.”
The sweeps continued for more than 50 days, with roving patrols of federal agents rounding up people across the city, including at day labor sites and at bus stops.
“The terror only stopped because of our sustained protests,” Salas said – protests along with a class action lawsuit, she added, involving other civil rights organizations.
Shortly before she left L.A. to travel to Kansas City, a temporary restraining order was upheld by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The order is to stop indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties, including Los Angeles.
“The majority of the protests that brought thousands of people into the streets, they were peaceful, and they were nonviolent,” she said.
Salas’ deepest message was to a specific group.
Eight in 10 Latinos are U.S. citizens. At more than 66 million people, Latinos as a demographic are the nation’s largest minority group. Salas spoke to all of them.
“I stand before you and I ask you to fight for our rightful place in this country,” she said. “To use your social, your economic, your political power to stop these injustices and the brutality that has been unleashed against us all.”
Appearing on the same panel with Salas was David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union California. Huerta detailed how he had been arrested in June during a protest. He was held in jail for three days, charged with conspiracy to impede an officer, before being let out on bond.
“They hear your voices on the inside,” Huerta said. “Your voices do resonate when they are detained.”
He too emphasized a reaction of nonviolence as being essential to this moment as the Latino community resists the raids and sweeping arrests of undocumented people.
The following day, August 6, federal agents in L.A. conducted what has been called Operation Trojan Horse. Early in the morning, near a Home Depot store, agents were hidden in the back of a rented Penske truck. When the back door opened, they piled out to conduct a raid.
Reports are that more than a dozen immigrants were arrested on suspicion of being undocumented. That news broke long after the panel discussion ended and conference goers attended other sessions.
But it struck with weight in Kansas City.
One Saturday in late May, dozens of members of the white nationalist group Patriot Front had piled out rented U-Haul’s near downtown Kansas City and paraded themselves through the streets. Some carried Confederate flags and chanted about “reclaiming America.”
They didn’t stay long. Police, and citizens who began to protest the group’s presence, were soon on the scene.
But the masks the Patriot Front wore, their uniform outfits and certainly the use of the rented moving trucks, were eerily similar to the news footage of the agents who took part in the Trojan Horse operation in L.A.
The images, side by side, gave a chilling new weight to the challenge issued by Salas.
“This is a defining moment for the Latino community,” she said. “We belong here. This is our home.”

(Getty Images)When I heard that President Donald Trump is bringing back the Presidential Fitness Test, I felt sorry for children who will be put through that terrible program.
“This is a wonderful tradition, and we’re bringing it back,” Trump said of the fitness test. 
No. No it’s not.
The Presidential Fitness Test began in 1966 but was phased out during the Obama administration. Thanks Obama (no, for real, thank you). 
I enjoyed gym class most days. Four square, volleyball and crab soccer were all an absolute blast. But the days when everyone watched as I struggled to do a pull up, climb a rope or do a sit up made me hate exercise for years. As I fought to complete a sit-up in high school, I’ll never forget my gym teacher telling me I’d have real problems giving birth if I couldn’t do a sit-up. It felt just as inappropriate then as it does now.
As someone who isn’t gifted athletically, it wasn’t fun to fail those tests. And it was upsetting that my overall GPA was brought down because I wasn’t strong enough to climb a rope. 
It wasn’t until two years ago when I began going to a gym regularly that I realized that I do actually love to exercise. There was no pressure to do 10 sit ups — I was told to do what I could. Can’t do a push up? Try this alternative, it will help build strength so you can eventually do it. It’s supportive. There’s no feeling like a failure. 
Physical fitness is so important. There are ways to encourage this without tests. The Presidential Youth Fitness Program, which replaced the original test, promoted the health and physical fitness of children instead. 
Trump designated Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to administer the Presidential Fitness Test.
Under Kennedy, the Trump administration is taking some non-traditional — and dangerous — approaches to health, such as firing experts on a vaccine panel, and replacing them with vaccine skeptics. 
Kennedy refers to his movement as Make America Healthy Again. The MAHA movement in West Virginia has yet to tackle any serious health issues, like our high rates of childhood obesity and diabetes. We have a severe lack of mental health care for our youth and food deserts that leave some families without access to fresh food. There are too many babies who are exposed to drugs while in the womb.
The MAHA website lists each action states have made as part of the MAHA agenda. So far, West Virginia has done two things — the West Virginia Healthy Schools Law, which bans certain artificial dyes from being used in food and the waiver that prevents SNAP benefits from being used to buy soda. 
West Virginia’s food and beverage industry warned that the food dye ban will lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves because there’s not an abundance of alternative ingredients. 
Meanwhile 1 in 5 children in the Mountain State face hunger. According to Feeding America, charitable programs alone aren’t able to support people who face hunger — government assistance programs are necessary to help bridge the gap.
Almost 38% of households that receive SNAP benefits have children. And more than 67% of school-aged children qualify for free or reduced-priced meals.
The Mountain State has one of the highest rates of child obesity at almost 22%. The national average is 16.2%.
Preparing healthy foods and snacks is time-consuming and more parents are feeding their children fast food. A 2018 study found that low cost and increased value of fast-food meals, as well as convenience and easy access, lead to the increased consumption. 
Another report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevents found that Black and Hispanic kids eat more fast food than their white counterparts, and over one-third ate fast food on any given day.
“These are not surprising findings when you think about how strapped families are these days for both time and money, and how fast food can be an easy option for stressed families,” Dr. Eliana Perrin, professor of pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine, told NBC News.
What could help fight childhood obesity and diabetes? Getting children outside more to play, but because of climate change it’s often too hot to safely play outside for long periods. 
Making healthy food cheaper would be another great option instead of banning foods from SNAP recipients. Congress’ Farm Bill actually makes burgers cheaper than salads. 
There’s not just one way to improve the health of West Virginians. But a step in the right direction would be to listen to health experts over conspiracy theorists. It’s hard to have the strength to pass a fitness test when you’re not getting enough to eat.

And he wants his ongoing lawsuit against the city and county to hurt.
Eric Meyer appeared on the Kansas Reflector podcast to talk about how things have changed since the Aug. 11, 2023, raid, when police stormed the newsroom under the false pretense that a reporter had committed identity theft by looking up a driving record in a public online database. They took computers and reporters’ personal cellphones, acting outside the scope of a search warrant that was issued in disregard for the U.S. Constitution and state and federal laws that protect journalists.

The raid spawned one state and five federal lawsuits, as well as a criminal charge against Gideon Cody, the former police chief who led the raid. The legal action continues to unfold as attorneys battle in federal court and a hearing in Cody’s case is scheduled for this fall.
Following is an edited and abbreviated Q&A from the podcast with Meyer.
 How has your life changed in the past two years?

You don’t have long enough in your podcast to explain it all. It has changed massively. In addition to the practical side of it, that I’ve had a lot of places I’ve gone, a lot of speeches I’ve given, a lot of other things that have gone on, but just the work of it. You know, this was my retirement gig. I was going to come here and do this part-time for fun.
 What could be more fun than this?

Well, it is fun. I at one point said that my mother, who died as a result of the stress of the raid, had an opportunity at 98 to go out meaning something in her life. But it’s nice as a retiree to be out here doing something, of still meaning it somehow or another, trying to keep trying — maybe as Don Quixote — to keep journalism alive. But we are trying our hardest to not bow to pressures and still get good journalism out there. And it really is a battle.
 What are some of the revelations that have come out since we last checked in with you about this time a year ago?

Not as many as you’d think. We’re still literally blocked from discovery in our federal court lawsuits, which means we can’t go out and interrogate people that we think have information that would be relevant to the case. And part of this is being able to figure out the degree to which political people, elected officials and others, helped push this raid along.
 This is important because there’s sort of been a narrative at times to pin this all on one rogue police chief, but I think the evidence clearly shows that one guy can’t do this in isolation. It was a coordinated effort.

Exactly. And I really object when that thought comes up, that this was just Gideon Cody who did this. And yeah, he did a lot of it himself. But there were people within law enforcement who helped him, people in elected positions, people in judicial court positions, who could have and should have stopped him, and they didn’t. Now, was it because they were not courageous? They didn’t want to make waves? Or was it that they agreed with him? Or was it that that they were just incompetent to what’s going on? I don’t know. That would be nice to find out.
 Where do things stand in your case?

It’s abundantly clear from the rulings of the judge so far in the case on various motions of dismissal that we’ve probably won the case.
The most telling of these things was we had sued the city of Marion for failing to provide training to its police officers about the Privacy Protection Act, which says that you’re supposed to get subpoenas, not warrants, to raid newsrooms. And the judge threw that out, saying any fool who’d be a cop should know this automatically and without requiring specialized training.
And there are overtures now to try to settle — some official, some unofficial. I’m eager to get the thing done. But there are things other than financial damages at stake here. So there needs to be some admissions. There need to be things that are reported to licensing authorities for police officers other than Gideon Cody.
 Are you committed to not settling, to seeing this out through trial?

The real reason we wanted to go to trial was we wanted a ruling on the record that acknowledges that this is something you just don’t do. And if they are willing to provide that as a stipulation, we might accept that. This has never been about money.
This is about making sure that people understand what they did was wrong, admit that publicly. Set it as an example. And somehow or other, it needs to hurt. One of our concerns is that they’ll want to settle up to the limit of their insurance coverage. Well, that really means you did nothing. I mean, it really probably needs to go a little beyond insurance. Now, we don’t want to bankrupt the city or county of Marion by any manner or means. But something that has a little pain to it.
 Do you feel like you still have strong community support?

I think everybody, including me, would like to see this over. But they’re very supportive of us. They just don’t like the fact that it looks like we’re hickville. And to be honest, I think that’s a very unfair assumption. I think that Marion and Marion County are not hickville. Some things that went on in Marion and Marion County that probably go on in a lot of other counties have been exposed. We just don’t hear about them in other counties.
And to an extent, Marion County should take pride in the fact there here, we’ve had a situation where somebody tried to trample on rights, and it didn’t happen. We fixed it. We’re in the process of fixing it. So you can take pride in that. It’s not where cops were stupid and raided a newsroom. It’s where somebody tried something stupid and, you know what? They didn’t get away with it. I think that’s a point of pride, but it would be nice to be known for something else.
 I think it’s worth pointing out that accountability journalism put you in the crosshairs of police for this raid. But this is the role that journalists need to embrace, right, in this current climate?

Oh, absolutely.
I’m sorry to tell this to a group of people out there: There are facts. And some things are facts. And your opinion of the fact doesn’t change whether it’s a fact or not. And you have to pay attention to the nuances. You have to pay attention to the little things.
 You and your late mother were inducted in the Kansas Press Association Hall of Fame last year. I went to the induction ceremony, where you gave this speech, shortly after the election in November, and you gave a sort of rallying cry to journalists. You said: “Make democracy great again.” Are journalists rising to meet this moment?

Some are, when they still have money to do it. I mean, closing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is going to silence a great number of people in public media. Corporations are going to take care of silencing a great number of people elsewhere.
We need to have people aggressively going out and finding out what’s wrong. We had a story this week: They applied a new coating of pavement to the main road that leads to Pilsen, which is the home of Emil Kapaun, the man who’s about to be sainted as a Korean War hero. And it didn’t stick, and the road is now basically untravellable. Did they tell us about it? No! We had to find out about it. And now it’s a game of finger-pointing.
Journalists have joined this Gen Z thing: “We don’t want to embarrass anybody. Oh, my goodness, somebody might take offense if we run this story.” And so they don’t want to do it, and their corporate bosses say, “Oh yeah, they might cancel their ads. Oh, we can’t do that.” So we make our news publications and news broadcasts and other things so dull that nobody wants to read them anymore or listen to them anymore.
I used to say this as a journalism professor — that’s why I came here in my retirement, was that I think there’s still a place in this world for regular, good old-fashioned journalism. And this is from somebody who taught online and stuff like that in school. I said, “We’ve wasted too much time worrying about that stuff, and not enough time worrying about the substance of what we’re reporting. And get out there and get interesting things that matter to people and tell us about them.”
So I said, “Well, I can’t solve it for the world, but maybe I can make a little demonstration project out here that we can try to do it. And of course, somebody says, “Yeah, and what happened to you: You get raided.” Yeah, that’s true. But the raiding gives us more attention.
I may be quixotic in some regards and Pollyannaish in another, but the raid drew attention to the fact that we’re actually trying to do good journalism. So there’s a positive outcome to the raid.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)In a sweeping policy shift that could reshape labor relations at one of the largest federal agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has terminated collective bargaining agreements for most of its unionized workforce, citing a need to better serve veterans and implement long-stalled management reforms.
The decision, announced last week, follows an executive order from President Donald Trump that excludes certain agencies from labor-management relations programs on national security grounds.
The VA said it acted under that order to end union contracts covering hundreds of thousands of employees represented by five major labor organizations, including the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees, National Nurses United, and the Service Employees International Union.
The impact could be particularly significant in North Carolina, which is home to more than 600,000 veterans and has more than 17,000 VA employees working in hospitals, clinics, and benefits offices across the state — including major medical centers in Asheville, Durham, Fayetteville and Salisbury.
North Carolina state Sen. Val Applewhite, a Democrat who represents Cumberland County which is home to Fort Bragg, said she was not surprised that the Trump administration would target collective bargaining, but is “disappointed” that he chose to start with the VA.
“This president clearly has no boundaries, and clearly has no shame, and clearly has no respect for veterans,” she said. “If we don’t stand up this midterm and make some adjustments in Congress, we’re going further and further down into this deep, dark hole,” Applewhite said.
“How many lives will be impacted?” she asked “How many veterans could die or linger with medical issues because of this?”
While the VA will maintain agreements for approximately 4,000 police officers, firefighters and security guards — occupations exempt from the executive order — the vast majority of bargaining-unit employees across the country are now operating without formal union contracts.
The move drew swift criticism from labor groups but was celebrated by Trump allies and VA leadership as a long-overdue realignment of priorities at an agency that serves more than 9 million veterans annually.
“This decision is good news for Veterans, families, caregivers and survivors,” VA Secretary Doug Collins said in a statement. “Too often, unions that represent VA employees fight against the best interests of Veterans while protecting and rewarding bad workers. We’re making sure VA resources and employees are singularly focused on the job we were sent here to do: providing top-notch care and service to those who wore the uniform.”
VA officials said the decision will allow managers to more effectively reward high performers, hold poor performers accountable and eliminate bureaucratic hurdles to hiring and reform.
According to the agency, more than 1,900 VA employees collectively spent over 750,000 hours on union activity during fiscal year 2024 — time that was compensated with taxpayer dollars.
Additionally, the agency cited the use of over 187,000 square feet of VA office and clinical space by union representatives, free of charge, as a significant cost burden. Officials said those resources — which also include union access to government phones and computer systems — should be redirected to patient care and veteran services.
The move also halts payroll deductions for union dues for most employees, a change that took effect on April 25 in compliance with the executive order.
Labor organizations say the agency is turning its back on frontline workers, many of whom are veterans themselves, and warned that terminating collective bargaining agreements will degrade working conditions and compromise patient care.
“This is a direct attack on the rights of the people who care for our nation’s veterans,” Irma Westmoreland, chair of National Nurses United, told Axios. “Without a contract, nurses fear they won’t be empowered to speak up about conditions that put our patients at risk.”
Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia called the decision “shortsighted, counterproductive, and disrespectful to those who’ve worn the uniform,” warning that gutting collective bargaining rights would make it even harder for the agency to recruit and retain skilled professionals amid staffing shortages and rising demand for care.
Applewhite, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, had similar concerns. The N.C. state senator said she had recently spoken with a constituent unable to get treatment through the VA for a brain bleed and partial blindness after three months of waiting. Now, veterans are frequently referred to the civilian market due to capacity issues at the VA, something Applewhite has witnessed herself as a disabled veteran.
“One of the things that helped me to stay 20 years, one of the carrots that are dangled at the end of this long journey is that you will have access to health care,” Applewhite said. “Now, it’s looking less and less attractive — like, so you mean to tell me this health care now takes me three months to get an eye appointment?”
The VA contends that unions have consistently resisted efforts to modernize the agency and hold employees accountable.
Officials noted that the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees  and National Nurses United opposed the bipartisan MISSION Act, which expanded veterans’ access to private-sector care. The National Federation has also supported repealing the 2017 VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was designed to speed disciplinary action against employees and protect whistleblowers.
According to the VA, the American Federation of Government Employees collaborated with the administration of former President Joe Biden to reinstate over 100 employees who were fired during Trump’s first term and helped secure nearly $134 million in back pay for more than 1,700 employees dismissed for alleged misconduct.
Labor advocates counter that these laws have been misused to retaliate against whistleblowers and sidestep due process protections, particularly during the Trump administration.
The action makes the VA the first federal agency to fully sever collective bargaining agreements under the Trump-era executive order, a move made possible by language exempting agencies involved in “national security” functions.
Axios reported that the decision could affect up to 400,000 workers — roughly a quarter of the federal workforce with union protections.
While the full impact of the VA’s action remains to be seen, labor leaders and policy analysts expect legal challenges and a new round of political fights over the balance between government efficiency and worker protections.
For now, the department insists its mission is clear.
“This is about putting veterans first,” said Collins. “And if that means upsetting union bosses who’ve been standing in the way of reform, so be it.”

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements. North Dakota lawmakers considered a bill to ban kratom but the legislation failed. Lawmakers passed a bill that called for an optional study, but Legislative Management did not select the topic for a study this interim.

Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
Pain relief or a problem? North Dakota lawmakers hear kratom debate

The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)For millions of years, water flowing through the Colorado River shaped the geography of the West, carving out features like the Grand Canyon. Now, the Colorado River sustains the cities, farms and industries of the southwestern U.S., providing 40 million people with water. The river winds through canyons, alpine tundras, deserts and forests, underpinning ecosystems, vitalizing trout fisheries, feeding migratory birds and maintaining river deltas.
The Colorado River is remarkable in and of itself, it lays the foundation for remarkable habitats, and, apparently, can precipitate remarkable political alliances. This month, all 10 of Colorado’s U.S. legislators, from the most progressive representatives to MAGA Lauren Boebert, sent a letter to President Donald Trump calling for the release of funding for Colorado River water projects.
The water in the Colorado River is distributed among seven Western states, separated into two groups — Upper Basin and Lower Basin states — via terms established in a 1922 compact. Individuals and businesses within those states are allocated water by the doctrine of prior appropriation, which, in Colorado, was established in 1876. The prior appropriation doctrine grants permanent rights to (surface) water on a first come, first served basis, more frequently known as “first in time, first in right” — although the true first-comers, Native Americans, were excluded from the doctrine and only secured water rights through a series of lawsuits throughout the 20th century.

There are many faults with the 1922 Colorado River Compact and prior appropriation doctrine, but one of the greatest is that the river is perpetually over-allocated. In fact, the Colorado River is dammed and diverted to such an extent that most years it fails to reach the Pacific Ocean. When government officials estimated how much annual flow was available for use back in 1922, they settled on 20 million acre-feet — nearly double the approximately 12 million acre-feet flowing through the river today.
Three-quarters of water diverted from the Colorado River irrigates farmland, and 62% of that is used for hay to feed dairy and beef cows in the U.S., China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. Over the years, existing water rights have been concentrated into fewer hands. About 20 farming families, producing mostly hay, control about 15% of the water allocated to Lower Basin states. One family in California’s Imperial Valley uses more water than the entire Las Vegas metropolitan area annually — again, mostly to grow hay.
Climate change is exacerbating the Colorado River water shortage by extending droughts and aridifying the Southwest. That’s why the $150 million appropriated to Colorado for water projects to improve drought resiliency, ecosystem conservation, and aging infrastructure is so essential. The projects — awarded to coalitions of local governments, tribes and nonprofits — would benefit agriculture, recreationists, municipalities, endangered species … and ultimately all of the stakeholders reliant upon the Colorado River. The Trump administration’s decision to withhold the funding while re-reviewing the projects benefits nobody and hurts everybody, thereby instigating a true bipartisan effort to release the funds.
The money allocated to Colorado’s water projects represents only a small portion of the $4 billion set aside in the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for Colorado River water conservation programs. Much of that money was spent on direct payments to farmers for not using their full “water rights” — instead, the farmers were compensated for letting acreage go fallow. This program and its sudden end under the Trump administration demonstrate several points. One, that the nation’s food supply does not rely on all farmers in the West maximizing their yields. Two, that local and state officials cannot rely on federal funding to solve the Colorado River water shortage. And, three, that voluntary solutions that work within the current framework of water allocation are not sustainable or sufficient in the long run.
Ultimately, the federal government should release the owed water project funding — what better use is there for taxpayer dollars than ensuring Western communities have access to plentiful drinking water, vibrant ecosystems and healthy economies? But also, the only way to truly confront this water crisis is a paradigm shift; a reallocation of the river’s water, not just among states, but also uses. The prior appropriation doctrine was designed to stimulate industrial and colonialist expansion. It’s an inappropriate framework to handle modern priorities of sustainability, conservation and equity. Undermining certain tenets of the doctrine is warranted.
Solutions — many of which are controversial — exist, like charging more for using water that isn’t beneficial to the region or country (e.g., irrigating alfalfa to feed Saudi Arabian cattle) or outlawing wasteful irrigation techniques. Bold policies are needed to preserve the remarkable Colorado River and life in the West. Stakeholders must rethink current systems of water allocation.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.

 Arkansas defines microschools
The rules governing Arkansas’ Educational Freedom Account program define a “micro-school” as “a tuition-based organization that serves a community of homeschool students, simultaneously in the same space, and that maintains responsibility for employing instructors or facilitators to provide part-time or fulltime academic services.”
The voucher program rules require microschools to teach the core academic subjects of math, English language arts, social studies and science.
The rules also specify that a microschool “is not a learning pod, a daycare facility, or a private school.”


“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo courtesy of VCU Capital News Service)State Democrats plan to make Indigenous People’s Day an official holiday in Virginia and will discuss the proposal in the next legislative session in January, a state delegate said over the weekend. The measure could face opposition from Republicans and others because it would mean replacing Columbus Day. 
Next session will mark the third straight year the idea has been proposed, after Democrats failed twice to bring the matter forward in committee hearings. 
On Saturday, Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, announced she plans to introduce legislation in December to make Indigenous Peoples Day, which is widely observed in Virginia, an official holiday. The holiday would be observed on the second Monday in October, replacing Columbus Day, commemorating the 15th-century navigator and explorer Christopher Columbus.
While he was known for his exploration work, Columbus also paved the way for the colonization and decimation of Indigenous communities and his legacy has come under fresh scrutiny in recent years. 
“As we celebrate International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, I am proud to be working alongside representatives from Virginia’s Indian tribes and indigenous advocates led by The Pocahontas Project to finally establish Indigenous Peoples’ Day as an official holiday in the Commonwealth,” Cousins said in a statement on Saturday. “I am committed to sharing more honest history, uplifting marginalized communities, and celebrating underrepresented stories, and this legislation is an important next step in that ongoing process.”
President Donald Trump and members of the Knights of Columbus have publicly stated they oppose Indigenous Peoples Day replacing Columbus Day. In April, Trump criticized Democrats for “destroying” Columbus’ legacy and committed to restoring the federal holiday named after him. 
Republicans and the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) have also generally opposed public efforts to eliminate Columbus Day.
“As an organization devoted to the promotion and preservation of Italian American heritage, we support unequivocally maintaining Columbus Day’s status as a federal holiday,” NIAF said. “We believe that Christopher Columbus’ courageous voyage was the catalyst that initiated over 500 years of immigration to the Americas by people from every corner of the Earth— all of whom were seeking a better life for their families.”
A recent effort to replace the name failed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Last week, a Pennsylvania court overturned a Philadelphia mayor’s executive order to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day, stating he did not have the power to do so.
The Mercury reached out to Republican leaders in the statehouse for comment on the pending proposal but did not hear back by press time.
Cousins’ effort comes after Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, presented a similar proposal during the 2024 and 2025 sessions. She is partnering with The Pocahontas Project, a Richmond-based organization that leads the Indigenous Peoples’ Day Initiative, a national movement to inspire federal, state, and local governments to officially recognize the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day.
Democrats’ efforts to make Indigenous People’s Day an official holiday builds on work by former Gov. Ralph Northam, who proclaimed the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day in 2020, to recognize the histories and cultures of Indigenous people. Though the observance stands, it is not an official state holiday.
Connor Tupponce, vice chairperson of the Virginia Tribal Education Consortium (VTEC), said the proposal would honor his ancestors and the resilience of VTEC’s tribal cultures and communities.
“It presents an opportunity for all Virginians to come together in celebration of Indigenous Peoples as living, breathing, and evolving cultures, rather than figments of history, frozen in time,” Tupponce said in a statement. “This initiative further exemplifies the longstanding relationships between the commonwealth and Tribal Nations, as well as their commitment to uplifting the voices of Indigenous Peoples for generations to come.”
The proposal’s success will likely depend on the outcome of the gubernatorial race. Democrats are seeking to regain control of the governor’s mansion and hold their slim majority in the statehouse by electing Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger, while Republicans want to maintain control of the executive office by electing Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A coalition of school districts, a teachers union, the vice president of the Manchester NAACP, and an LGBTQ+ advocacy group are suing the state over a new law that seeks to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion policies from schools and local governments. 
That law, which was added to the state’s two-year budget signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte in June, seeks to strip out DEI programs from public schools, public universities, and government entities, and includes financial penalties for school districts that don’t comply.
Supporters of the law, passed as part of House Bill 2, say it will remove policies that are discriminatory and will require school districts and governments to treat people by merit and not identity.
But plaintiffs in the lawsuit — filed in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, and attorneys from Drummond Woodsum & MacMahon — say the law is vague and unconstitutional, and would prevent schools from providing an “inclusive education.”
“Given HB 2’s vague and far-reaching scope in the education context, enforcers undoubtedly will arbitrarily decide when HB 2 applies and when it does not,” the lawsuit contends. “To the extent enforcers believe that any of this conduct is exempt from HB 2, this merely underscores the vague, irrational, and incomprehensible parameters of the law.”
The Department of Justice is likely to file a motion responding to this month’s lawsuit in the coming weeks. “We will review the complaint and will respond as appropriate in court,” a spokesman, Michael Garrity, said in a statement Friday. 
The lawsuit echoes similar legal action in 2021 against the state’s so-called “divisive concepts law,” which barred public school teachers from advocating certain concepts about racial and gender disparities and oppression. That lawsuit led the U.S. District Court to strike down that law in May 2024, after the court agreed with plaintiffs that it was too vague for teachers to follow. The state has since appealed that decision to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral arguments in April.
What the new law does
The language in HB 2 seeks to prevent any diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at the state and local governmental level. 
Under the new law, no public entity may “implement, promote, or otherwise engage in” any DEI-related programs, trainings, or policies. That includes implicit bias training, DEI assessments, critical race theory, or race-based hiring or promotion.
The law defines DEI as “any program, policy, training, or initiative that classifies individuals based on a characteristic identified under RSA 354-A:1 for the purpose of achieving demographic outcomes, rather than treating individuals equally under the law.” Those characteristics include age, sex, gender identity, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, and national origin. 
In addition to school districts, the law applies to municipal government departments, offices, boards, and subdivisions. It also applies to vendors. Local government entities are required to review their existing contracts “for the presence of DEI-related provisions,” a process that will be overseen by the state’s Department of Justice. 
The law requires all public school districts to carry out a review of their vendor contracts by Sept. 30 and identify any DEI provisions, and it requires the Department of Education to monitor that review process and submit a report aggregating all school district contracts to the Legislature by Oct. 1. 
And the potential consequences for school districts are steep. 
“Should a public school fail to abide by any section of this subdivision, either knowingly or unknowingly, the commissioner of the department of education shall immediately halt all sources of public funding to that public school, until such time as the school comes into compliance with all sections of this subdivision,” the law states.
Debate over impact
For supporters of the new law, the anti-DEI prohibition is designed to make schools and state and local governments fairer to all. Rep. Jess Edwards, an Auburn Republican, likened DEI programs to affirmative action programs, and said eliminating them would require school districts to be more objective.
“Aren’t we supposed to be judged by the content of our character and not our skin?” Edwards said at a hearing in April in which the language was first added to the state budget.
But plaintiffs in this month’s lawsuit say the breadth of the DEI ban could affect programs the laws supporters do not intend to target.
For instance, plaintiffs argue, a school district could interpret the law to prevent them from creating sports teams specifically for girl; from making menstrual hygiene products available at no cost to female students; from teaching Holocaust classes that consider how intolerance and bigotry can be combatted; and from attempting to create greater access for Black and Latino students to comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
And the law could entangle special education plans under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, plaintiffs allege, because school districts might interpret the ban to prevent them from treating people with a “physical or mental disability” differently. 
“These concepts are, at their core, about addressing the individualized needs of specific disabled people — namely, providing individualized services, accommodations, and supports that, by definition, are not provided to others,” the lawsuit states. 
Those outcomes are not guaranteed, but they are possible given the vagueness of the new law and the challenge for school districts to interpret how to comply with it, the plaintiffs argued, especially with the risk of severe financial penalties if they are deemed to be noncompliant.
The plaintiffs also note that the law does not affect just public school districts or public colleges and universities. According to letters sent by the state Department of Education and cited in the lawsuit, any private school receiving public education freedom account dollars could be subject to the law, as well as any private college.
Charges of vagueness were at the heart of the 2021 lawsuit against the state “divisive concepts” law. In that case, attorneys for the state argued that the law, and subsequent guidance from the state Department of Justice to teachers, was not overly vague and that the lines of what should be allowed or not allowed in a classroom were clear. 
In response to that lawsuit, some Republican state lawmakers proposed amending the “divisive concepts” law this year to clarify that it applies only when teachers “knowingly” teach concepts that are not allowed. Those bills, House Bill 50 and Senate Bill 100, both died after the House and Senate could not find agreement 
The 2025 anti-DEI law does not include that limitation: It applies to situations where school districts allow DEI programs to continue “either knowingly or unknowingly.”
Other free speech challenges
The latest federal lawsuit dovetails slightly with another filed by the National Education Association in March, also in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire. That lawsuit challenges the U.S. Department of Education’s February “Dear Colleague” letter in which federal officials called on schools to eliminate DEI programs or face the denial of federal funding. 
That threat has been paused since April, when Judge Landya McCafferty issued a preliminary injunction against any enforcement of the letter.
Plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm,” McCafferty wrote in her preliminary injunction order.  “Plaintiffs’ members are presently suffering First Amendment violations as a result of defendants’ coercion of educational institutions into censoring their members’ speech.”
Meanwhile, schools and state officials are waiting for the appeals court in Boston to rule on the state’s appeal of the order striking down the “divisive concepts” law.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Full-New-Hampshire-House-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-12 05:56:47.530901

(Stock photo by Henry Redman/States Newsroom.)Buried in a March executive order from President Donald Trump is a provision that could cast doubt on voting machines in Ohio and around the country. The order directs federal officials to amend a set of security benchmarks for voting machines.
Those standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, are indeed voluntary. But some states, including Ohio, require compliance with the most recent guidelines in state statute.
“If that were to be implemented — if that executive order were to be implemented by the (Election Assistance Commission),” Lorain County Board of Elections Director Paul Adams explained, “it would basically decertify our equipment.”

The order
The president’s executive order drew a lot more attention for a different voting issue. Trump wanted to alter federal voter registration forms to require proof of citizenship. That move was quickly challenged and put on hold by the courts.
The guidelines updates would bar voting machines “in which a vote is contained within a barcode or quick-response code” unless it’s necessary to accommodate people with disabilities.
The order goes on to state ballots “should provide a voter-verifiable paper record.”
Adams explained that Lorain County, and several others, use machines that encode a voter’s choices so that the ballot can be quickly read by a machine. But even in those cases, there’s a paper trail to back up the votes. Election officials check that record in the post-election audit that happens after every single election.
“So, for the sake argument,” Adams explained, “if, for some reason, the bar code was off and it gave votes to somebody else for president or gave votes to somebody else for governor, you’re going to find that in the audit. You’re also going to find out in any recount.”
The reason is pretty simple: people don’t read barcodes.
“On a recount or an audit, you are looking at — not that barcode — you’re looking at actually what appears on the ballot that the voters saw when they cast their ballot.”
According to the Secretary of State, the majority of Ohio counties still use hand-marked paper ballots. But 28 counties, including Lorain, use a machine that prints out voters’ selections, and another 13 use a machine that directly records a person’s vote while producing a paper record.
The Ohio Capital Journal asked the Secretary of State’s office about the potential impact of the executive order. Secretary Frank LaRose did not respond.
So what happens next?
The first big question on Adams’ mind is dollars and cents. Think about the last time you went to vote. How many voting booths were there? How about ballot scanners? Now multiply that by hundreds of polling locations. All of that equipment is expensive, and Adams is quick to note no one at the state or federal level is offering to pick up the tab.
“So, this is going to be borne by local taxpayers,” he said. “It’s going to be boards of elections going to their county commissioners and saying, ‘I need to replace my voting equipment.’ And we’re talking millions of dollars.”
Nationwide, the cost could land in the billions.
Even before Trump’s executive order, the Election Assistance Commission was in the process of certifying machines for a recent update. The commission approved the first one just last month. Rachel Orey from the Bipartisan Policy Center said they’ve been studying what that transition might cost.
“Nationwide, it’s expected to cost probably, like $2-$5 billion to fully transition to this new type of voting equipment. Our current like, best guess is about $3 billion,” Orey explained.
Adams added that timing presents a challenge, as well. With less than 90 days until this November’s election, it would be very difficult if not impossible to overhaul the system in time.
The 2026 primaries might be a different story, but Adams warned if every jurisdiction in the country is looking for new equipment, “that waiting list is going to be forever.”
The risks
Even if the changes laid out in the executive order are relatively straightforward, applying them to a complex system likely won’t be.
Orey pointed out the executive order doesn’t technically ban equipment, and the new draft guidelines implementing the order seem to contradict themselves.
The order leaves the door open for bar and QR code machines for people with disabilities, and the guidelines gesture toward limiting their use to those voters.
But at the same time, the guidelines encourage election officials to get more people using accessible equipment to maintain ballot secrecy or to spot security and maintenance problems.
Orey worries that confusion could breed distrust. At first blush, the executive order appears to ban barcodes, and they’re even beginning to hear some election officials describing it that way.
“For me, the risk is really about that voter walking into the polling place and thinking that their ballot isn’t going to be counted because the ballot has a QR code on it,” they said. “And then that, you know, kind of spiraling out into distrust and conspiracy theories elsewhere.”
Adams has complete faith in his county’s encoded ballots, but he’s not opposed to a different approach.
“I can see how it could make people think and give a perception — even though I don’t agree with that perception — that there’s an issue.”
But he insisted county boards need adequate time and money.
“That’s what we have had every other time in the last 30 years when there is a required upgrade like this,” Adams said. “You take time, you make sure that there’s options, and you make sure there’s money. I’m okay with that. It’s just this moving this fast, I think it’s going to set election officials up for a disaster.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-12 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT insurers ask for bigger health plan rate increases: What to know,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/12/ct-health-insurance-rate-increases/,Insurers want to boost the cost of state-regulated individual health plans by 17.8% on average. Requests are considerably higher this year.,"Amid a storm of policy changes, new cuts to Medicaid, tighter restrictions on care at community health centers and expiring federal subsidies, Connecticut insurers want to boost the cost of state-regulated individual health plans by an average of 17.8% next year.
They have also asked for an average rate increase of 13.1% on small group policies. 
The requests are considerably higher this year. In 2024, insurance companies asked for an average rate hike of 8.3% on individual plans and 11.9% on small group.
The plans collectively cover about 224,000 residents (158,000 in individual policies and 66,000 in small group).
“The Affordable Care Act was created to increase access to affordable care. In 2025, a record 24 million people enrolled in ACA marketplace plans nationwide. The progress the ACA has made over the years is at risk,” Connecticut Insurance Commissioner Andrew Mais wrote in an op-ed earlier this month, pointing to federal subsidies that will lapse later this year and rising rate hike requests nationwide.
Attorney General William Tong called the rate increase requests unaffordable and pledged to scrutinize the proposals.
“I’ll be combing through every page of these applications and demanding that insurers justify every penny and every step they have taken to curb these out-of-control costs,” he said. “Year after year, insurers demand soaring rate hikes that far outstrip the pace of inflation and other cost growth benchmarks. They give us padded applications with vague references to trends they do not disclose or take any steps to control. … We need to hold them accountable and require better.”
Here’s what to know about the proposed rate hikes.
How much of an increase are insurers seeking?
Three insurers sell plans through the state’s exchange, known as Access Health CT: Anthem Health Plans, ConnectiCare Insurance Company and CTCare Benefits Inc.
Anthem asked for an average rate hike of 14.2% (increases range from 6.4% to 22.8% depending on the plan) for individual policies that cover 83,790 people.
ConnectiCare is seeking an average increase of 26.1% (rate hikes range from 5.9% to 28.6% depending on the plan) for individual policies that cover 3,685 residents.
And CTCare requested an average increase of 21.7 % (rate hikes range from 4.7% to 26.7%) for individual plans that cover 70,160 people.
Anthem is also seeking a 13.2% average hike for its small group plans that include 48,666 residents.
Additionally, insurers are asking for increases on off-exchange policies.
Does the state have to approve the increases?
No. The state’s insurance department can choose to approve the full requested increases, reject them or amend them. The final decisions will be published later this summer.
State officials must ensure the requests are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. Actuaries will review the proposals, examining trends in unit cost (total expenditure incurred by the company), utilization of services and expected severity of claims.
Does the public have a say?
Yes. The public can weigh in on the proposed rate increases during a hearing on Aug. 18, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Connecticut’s Legislative Office Building (Room 1A, 300 Capital Ave., Hartford).
Residents can also post comments online by clicking “select” under each rate request listed here.
Why are they asking for rate hikes?
Stephanie DuBois, a spokeswoman for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Connecticut, said the higher rate hike request this year is due to more policyholders needing higher cost services, including emergency department visits.“Our submitted ACA rates are based on the health care services we expect members to access next year, along with the anticipated costs associated with that care,” she said. “Specifically, there has been an increase in ACA members utilizing higher-cost services, including emergency room care and behavioral health services, as well as some prescription drugs and specialty pharmacy. These rates also reflect our ability to deliver on behalf of consumers in Connecticut given the changes at the federal level.”
Officials with ConnectiCare did not respond to a request for comment.
In announcing the rate hike requests, leaders with the state insurance department noted that proposed increases generally stem from rising health care costs, including the price of prescription drugs and greater demand for medical services, among other changes.
What else is happening with plans on the exchange?
Decisions at the federal level will change the cost of many health plans on the state’s insurance exchange as early as this year.
Around 90% of Connecticut residents who purchase a plan on the exchange receive financial support to help cover the cost. At the end of 2025, one type of subsidy, known as “enhanced premium tax credits,” is set to expire. As a result, Connecticut residents with exchange plans could expect to pay $1,700 more on average every year for their health insurance, according to Access Health CT. Over 135,000 people will lose at least some financial support. A fifth of those people, or roughly 27,000, will no longer be eligible for any financial assistance.
The expiration of the enhanced subsidies will also deal a major blow to Covered Connecticut, a program that provides no-cost exchange plans to residents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but still earn 175% or less than the federal poverty level. Covered Connecticut currently provides more than 40,000 residents with no-cost health and dental coverage. The Department of Social Services estimates it would cost the state $30 million annually to continue the program.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Ohio Democrats are taking inspiration from Texas as they gear up for their own congressional redistricting battle.
Democrats across the nation are showing solidarity with Texas lawmakers, ones who fled their state to block a Republican-proposed congressional map from being passed — a map that redrew several seats currently held by Democrats to make them more favorable for the GOP.
“What starts in Texas is going to go on to the next state and the next state,” Ohio state Rep. Eric Synenberg, D-Beachwood, said.
Synenberg and several colleagues rallied outside the Massachusetts Statehouse with Texas and other states’ Democrats on Wednesday, since he believes that Ohio is the next state to take on this fight.
“They’re going to make the maps less fair, and therefore, an unproportionate and outsized number of Republican congressmen would have a better chance of winning their seats in 2026,” Synenberg said.
The congressional mapmaking process is set to begin soon in Ohio, with Republicans like Vice President JD Vance and state party leader Tony Schroeder hoping to expand the slim GOP majority in the U.S. House.
“The control of the House is incredibly important, and it all starts with the speaker,” Schroeder said. “Having a larger margin there makes life a lot easier in terms of getting legislation through.”
Ohio Republicans are eyeing three seats: Democratic U.S. Reps. Emilia Sykes of District 13 in Northeast Ohio, Marcy Kaptur of District 9 in Northwest Ohio, and Greg Landsman of District 1 in Southwest Ohio.
Although the state’s redistricting commission is controlled by GOP leaders, House Assistant Majority Floor Leader Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, said the national stage won’t play into Ohio’s mapmaking process.
“We’re not looking for any specific outcome,” Bird said. “We want to abide by the Ohio Constitution.”
Unlike the special session that was held to change the district lines in Texas, Ohio is required by law to redraw the congressional districts for 2026, since the 2022 map wasn’t agreed upon with bipartisan support.
Also, different from Texas, Ohio Democrats are unable to block a vote by fleeing the state and preventing a quorum.
Lawmakers get to draw maps first, but if there isn’t a bipartisan agreement, the Republican-controlled Ohio Redistricting Commission gets to do it.
State law already prevents Ohio from gerrymandering, Bird said, and said Ohio has a majority of GOP districts because, he claimed, the map is proportional to statewide election results.
Currently, there are 10 Republicans and 5 Democrats representing Ohio in the U.S. House. That’s 66% Republican.
“When you look at the margin by which Mike DeWine won and the margin by which Donald Trump has won Ohio the last couple of times, they’re significant,” Bird said.
President Donald Trump beat former Vice President Kamala Harris 55%-44% in 2024 in Ohio. With that result, Ohio’s 15 congressional districts would be 8 Republican and 7 Democratic.
But Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno said he believes Ohio should be 12-3. That would be 80% Republican.
That breakdown isn’t resonating with all GOP leaders, like Lt. Governor Jim Tressel.
We asked Tressel if that map make-up would be fair.
“Well, you know what? I can’t really join into that conversation,” Tressel responded. “If you would have asked me how many Republican, Democrat representatives we had, I wouldn’t have had the answer to it.”
Being lieutenant governor, Tressel was asked whether he thinks he should know the make-up of Ohio’s U.S. Congressional delegation.
“I suppose I should. If I had to take a quiz on it, you just quizzed me, and I just learned — that’s great,” Tressel said. “The only thing that’s fair is what the people vote for.”
Democrats say it’s encouraging that the Gov. Mike DeWine-Tressel administration says they want the voters’ voices to be heard.
“Even now with our 10-5, that’s not fair,” Synenberg said. “Anything on top of that would be, obviously, even worse and even less democratic.”
By law, state legislators must have a congressional map by the end of November.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman said in June that initial district drafting would begin in August.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms, and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing, and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates, and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors, or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, home school, or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under home-school laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%), or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or home-school microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “home-school hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%), or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York, and North Dakota, have more restrictive home-school or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt, and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning, and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Stock photo by WEWS.)Ohio advocates have been approved to start collecting signatures to put a marriage equality amendment and an equal rights discrimination protections amendment on the ballot.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost certified two separate constitutional amendment proposals Friday: one would remove a provision from the state Constitution that prohibits same-sex marriage, and the other would prohibit discrimination by state and local governments because of race, sex, pregnancy status, sexual orientation, disability, or other attributes.
Ohio Equal Rights, which is running both amendment campaigns, was required to put forward two proposals instead of one that focused on all LGBTQ+ rights. Republicans on the Ohio Ballot Board said that the same-sex marriage issue was fundamentally different than the discrimination protections.
Ohio Ballot Board splits proposed Ohio Equal Rights Amendment into two amendments

In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex couples have the fundamental right to marry, but the Ohio Constitution has never been updated to reflect that.
This citizen-led proposal would repeal the provision saying that “only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this state and its political subdivisions.”
In 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the Supreme Court of the United States should reconsider landmark cases such as Obergefell. This helped push forward this amendment, organizers said in July.
Because they already met with the ballot board in July, they were given the go-ahead by politicians that they wouldn’t need to return if it was split up as the board recommended, one of the Ohio Equal Rights team members said Friday.
The team did not say which ballot they are aiming for, but they will need to collect about 415,000 signatures for each amendment, they said.

(Photo by Getty Images)A group of Massachusetts lawmakers, officials and advocates are visiting Maine on Tuesday to learn more about how to prevent further contamination from so-called forever chemicals. 
Maine is regarded as a national leader for its work to implement policies that stymie the spread of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, which is a known carcinogen linked to an array of health issues. In addition to responding to high levels of PFAS in agricultural land from the historic spreading of sewage sludge, Maine was the first state to pass a rule requiring manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in products.
“Maine has led the way and we continue to lead the way,” said Rep. Bill Pluecker (I-Warren), who chairs the Legislature’s Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee, who will be among the Maine lawmakers hosting the Bay State delegation.
Earlier this year, the Maine Legislature also worked on proposals to expand testing for contaminants in private wells and rid the state of PFAS-laden firefighting foam, which is another significant source of contamination. Some of those proposals won’t be finalized until the next legislative session, which starts in January. 
Some progress made this session as Maine’s waste challenges keep piling up

Similarly, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey signed a law earlier this year to phase out the use of PFAS in protective gear for firefighters. The state’s Department of Environmental Protection also set PFAS drinking water standards in late 2020.
The Massachusetts delegation will start their day with a visit to a farm in Arundel that has been affected by PFAS contamination, followed by discussions with other farmers, advocates and Maine legislators in Augusta. The meeting was borne out of work between the Portland-based public health nonprofit Defend Our Health and a new national coalition called Sludge-Free Land, Pluecker said. 
Maine Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) and Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) will be joining Pluecker on Tuesday along with representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, as well as Defend Our Health and the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association.
While PFAS contamination is ubiquitous throughout the nation, the story in these two states is linked because the Vermont-based waste management company Casella imported sludge from Massachusetts and processed it in Maine before spreading it on agricultural fields as fertilizer, Pluecker explained. 
Adam Nordell, campaign manager with Defend Our Health, said Massachusetts’ sludge is still being brought into Maine to be composted, but because Maine banned the land application of sludge in 2022, it is now being sent back out of state. Maine was the first state to impose such a ban.

Nordell hopes the visit can spur a more regional discussion about addressing these toxic chemicals because “PFAS doesn’t necessarily respect property boundaries or state boundaries.”
Massachusetts Sen. Jo Comerford (D-Northampton) is currently sponsoring a bill that would ban the application of biosolids on land, as well as establish a fund to support farmers whose land has been affected or who would be impacted by increased fertilizer costs due to such a ban. The proposal also seeks to support municipalities in reducing sludge volume.
“Maine has led the nation in addressing and preventing further PFAS contamination on agricultural land while supporting impacted farms,” Comerford said. “I’m grateful to the legislators, agency officials, farmers, and advocates from both Maine and Massachusetts who will spend the day together learning about and discussing Maine’s approach and how we can embark on this work now in Massachusetts.”
Underscoring the importance of addressing contamination at its source, Pluecker said that more recent efforts in Maine to address PFAS in drinking water and private wells all trace back to sludge application.
Much of the progress made in Maine on PFAS stems from a task force, established by a 2019 executive order from Gov. Janet Mills, to determine the extent of forever chemical contamination in the state. It was also responsible for developing ways to protect Mainers from exposure to PFAS, which have been linked to serious long-term health problems including cancer, weakened immune systems, developmental issues, and more.










Maine has led the way and we continue to lead the way.


– Rep. Bill Pluecker (I-Warren)


Two years later, the state allocated $60 million dollars for the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to develop a program to address agricultural land that was contaminated by the spread of sewage sludge. 
In May, Mills signed a bill to codify the programs supporting farms with high levels of PFAS into state law to ensure the support for farmers and remediation can continue.
According to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, 90 Maine farms have been affected by PFAS chemicals to varying degrees through sludge application or other sources. 
Nordell lost his own farm to the toxic contamination, but he said most of those farms have been able to keep operating because the Legislature took action to support them. Maine’s success story shows that addressing PFAS contamination is “critically important and totally attainable,” he added. 
He hopes the delegation walks away from Tuesday’s visit feeling like “this is a problem they can afford to address.”
“If Maine can do that, then a state like Massachusetts can do it, too,” Nordell said.

(Getty Images)After one of the strongest earthquakes in recorded history grunted and shifted off the coast of Russia, geologists sent tsunami and aftershock warnings as far away as Hawaii and the North American mainland.
Thankfully, the July 29 earthquake, some 13 miles deep in the ocean and measuring 8.8 on the Richter scale, didn’t produce damage or injuries here in the U.S., though NBC News reported waves nearly 6 feet high slamming Maui.
Today on Kansas’ high plains, however, health care advocates warn of a figurative tsunami fueled by cruel Medicaid cuts that will shift tectonic plates beneath our hospitals, and it won’t stop there. The calamity will cascade in a variety of ways.
Medicaid advocates have said:

Births will become more dangerous because Medicaid covers nearly half of U.S. births.
Health care workers will lose their jobs.
Most hospitals will face short staffing.
Emergency rooms will see longer wait times.
Co-pays likely will increase.

David Jordan, president and CEO of United Methodist Health Ministry Fund along with REACH Healthcare Foundation, last month released a report from its partner organization Manatt Health, trying to forecast the impact of nearly $1 trillion in federal cuts.
Jordan told Kansas Reflector that the collected data were “clear and concerning.”
Twenty-nine Kansas hospitals are at immediate risk of closure and another 66 are at risk of closure, he said. Kansas Medicaid programs stand to lose $3.9 billion over 10 years and hospitals alone will lose $2.7 billion in Medicaid funding.
All of this in the name of “waste, fraud and abuse.” It’s reasonable to assume some waste, fraud or abuse, but not $1 trillion worth. 
“We will pay the price — higher costs, increases in local taxes, and less access to care — to offset these cuts,” Jordan said. “It’s critical that lawmakers, health care providers, advocates and the people of Kansas recognize the consequences before it’s too late.” 
Back in June, Brenda Sharpe, president and CEO at REACH, warned of dire consequences. 
“If this bill passes, it will cause long-lasting harm to thousands of families across Kansas and seriously threaten the survival of rural hospitals across the state,” Sharpe said on the REACH website. 
Manatt Health used computer models for its one-year and 10-year projections. Those findings were startling. 
For example, federal Medicaid cuts could lead to a 5% to 15% drop in enrollment, which could trigger a 22% drop in funding for state hospitals. This would increase the burden hospitals now face for uncompensated care. 
It will only worsen each year for the next 10 years, and that’s not the worst part. These aren’t just cuts. They will feel like amputations targeting the most vulnerable among us — children, seniors in need of long-term care and people with disabilities. 
“Kansans’ ability to access health coverage will be impacted by the changes to Medicaid and (Affordable Care Act) Marketplace eligibility and enrollment rules included in the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and by Congress’ failure to extend premium tax credits that make marketplace plans more affordable and led to a record enrollment of Kansans in ACA Marketplace plans last year,” Jordan said. “These changes would lead to an estimated 108,000 Kansans losing their Marketplace coverage will only increase uncompensated care, further challenging hospitals’ finances.” 
New eligibility restrictions, reduced benefits and new paperwork requirements certainly will mean that these vulnerable populations will end up losing coverage. Some 437,000 Kansans now rely on Medicaid. 
“We are trying to protect as many people as we can,” Sharpe said during a Zoom meeting with health care advocates. 
And after these cuts figuratively break people’s legs, they will be blamed for limping.  
A federal judge in July ruled that medical debt could remain on credit reports, canceling a policy of the previous administration to ease the burden of medical debt. This move will affect roughly a third of the nation.
“People who get sick shouldn’t have their financial future upended,” then-Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Rohit Chopra under Biden told NPR. “The CFPB’s final rule will close a special carveout that has allowed debt collectors to abuse the credit reporting system to coerce people into paying debts that they may not even owe.”  
In January, the CFPB cited research saying medical debt wasn’t a good indicator of borrower fitness and shouldn’t be included in credit reports. These scores help determine a family’s ability to purchase a car or home. 
The bill also included $300 billion in cuts from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as SNAP. According to the National Institutes of Health, economic stress can lead to various forms of violence. 
Johnathan Sublet, the founder and executive director of SENT Topeka, a nonprofit organization aimed at strengthening neighborhoods, said, “a 1% increase in food insecurity could lead to a 12% increase in violent crime.” 
The cascade will continue into the next decade as windows of accessibility narrow.  
According to Neilsberg Research, roughly 16% of the population in Kansas is 65 or older, and 2% is 85 or older. 
This federal mandate will funnel these folks, along with children and the disabled, into a labyrinth of phone trees and websites, ironically in the name of government efficiency, but designed to discourage people from even applying.  
Medicaid cuts created the earthquake. 
And if you look toward the horizon, you can see a mammoth tidal wave beginning to crest.

Expect it to become the rallying cry of voters in Ohio, Texas, Indiana, Missouri, and Florida when they get wise to how their Republican overlords plan to dilute their votes and silence their voices—by preemptively stealing more gerrymandered congressional districts to keep the Republican majority in the U.S. House. 
Never mind that some Ohio votes will count more than others when state district maps are designed (again) to produce only Republican wins. 
The redistricting maps state GOP lawmakers redraw in 2025, to entrench Republican power in Congress, could well steal the crucial 2026 election before a single vote is cast. 
Ironically, the dirty dealer driving this brazen power grab to disenfranchise voters in Republican-led states is the same one who drove another disenfranchising scheme four years ago that culminated in a mob of Trump supporters violently storming the U.S. Capitol. 
Remember how they roared “Stop the Steal!” as they beat police, smashed windows, defecated in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, and threatened to hang the vice president after he refused to toss certified election results for his boss? 
Trump commanded them to “stop the steal” and “fight like hell” because “you don’t concede when there’s theft involved.” He played his followers for chumps to stay in office. 
Multiple investigations, audits and legal challenges found zero evidence to support his bogus claims about massive election fraud. Yet Trump still summoned the MAGA faithful to Washington and sicced them on lawmakers gathered to ensure the peaceful transfer of power and honor the will of the American people. 
The post-2020 election plot Trump directed to illegally overturn a free and fair election was shameless: False presidential elector slates in seven states. State legislators and state officials pressured to alter vote totals. Georgia’s secretary of state strong-armed (on tape) by Trump to “find 11,870 votes” in order to flip the state — after voters had spoken.
Fortunately, principled Republican leaders (and avowed Trump backers) from targeted states, e.g., Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, pushed back on Trump’s lawless campaign to corrupt the outcome of a legitimate election. 
Even under intense coercion from the Trump White House to subvert the choice of the electorate, (as a partisan favor) GOP stalwarts, including former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, refused to go along. 
“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said in 2020, “but I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.” 
Back then, pro-Trump Republicans, like Bowers, were compelled to reject what Trump, and his co-conspirators, were peddling because it ran counter to the oath they took to the Constitution. 
Their allegiance to the rule of law prevailed over blind adherence to partisan subversion. They chose to protect the integrity of their elections rather than bow to the persistent harassment and intimidation tactics deployed by and for an unprincipled loser unwilling to accept the verdict of American voters.    
If only those Republican profiles in courage could be replicated today as Trump again tries to erase the voting power of ordinary citizens to decide who will represent them. 
He has mounted another pressure campaign on state GOP officials and legislators to redraw congressional maps in a brazen attempt to throw another election. This time, however, the felon-in-chief — whose attempted coup to stay in office (after his 2020 defeat) led to a horrifying insurrection against his own government — isn’t waiting until after the midterm elections to manipulate outcomes. 
He has targeted Republican-ruled states, including Ohio, to jigger the 2026 results in advance — 15 months before voters go to the polls. 
Trump, and his craven Ohio understudy JD Vance, are browbeating pliable state Republican lawmakers from Ohio to Florida to guarantee extra GOP seats in the U.S. House as insurance next November. 
Statehouse Trumpers who do as they’re told will fall in line, block all checks and balances on the Dear Leader and blunt Democratic congressional pickups in the off-year election by cheating now. 
It is unusual, though not unprecedented, for states to redraw voting boundaries in the middle of a decade when redistricting maps are normally done after each decennial census. But it is extremely unusual for the President of the United States to demand it of Republican-ruled states because he feels “entitled” to more Republican congressional districts with pre-selected voters who generate preordained election returns. 
Unlike 2020, there is no principled pushback from state Republicans. They are too fearful of crossing their king. 
Texas Republicans have the votes to satisfy Trump’s entitlement to a neutralized opposition with five newly gerrymandered districts. 
Florida Republicans hope to net a minimum of three new House seats from incumbent Democrats through arbitrary mid-decade redistricting. 
Missouri Republicans could add another Republican seat in Congress and Ohio Republicans are eyeing two or three more unconstitutionally gerrymandered congressional districts to appease Trump. 
They will rig the ground game to lock in absolute GOP control in districts that disenfranchise whole communities, that undermine voters’ ability to elect their preferred candidates. 
Call it grand theft politics to rob voters of their right to self-governance. From the same people who said, “Stop The Steal.”

The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

As has so often been the case with a legislature that refuses to work and negotiate in good faith, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein had little choice last week but to sign the so-called mini-budget that state lawmakers approved a few days earlier.
With the new fiscal year already well-underway and numerous vital public programs and services in jeopardy, Stein understandably had no appetite for provoking a crisis by vetoing what he rightfully described as a “Band-Aid budget.”
All that said, the mini-budget bill is deeply and destructively flawed.
Among many other things: it fails to provide meaningful raises for teachers and state employees, fails to provide the minimum funding required to keep the state’s Medicaid program healthy, and fails to renew the hugely successful Healthy Opportunities Program that had slashed health expenditures and improved outcomes for low-income Medicaid enrollees.
The bottom line: The mini-budget is but the latest example of legislative leaders failing to fulfill their basic duties of governance. All North Carolinians should demand better.

Getty Images Georgia could soon take on an inspection role in ensuring grass-fed beef lives up to its labeling under a new proposal a key state legislator says he may pursue next year. 
State Rep.  Robert Dickey, who chairs the House Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Committee, said there needs to be more transparency in how cattle are raised in the grass-fed beef industry to protect consumers from potentially misleading marketing.
“We’ve got a great beef industry and healthy food, and that’s what consumers are looking for,” the Musella Republican said. “We just want to make sure that they are getting what they are paying for. We want to put parameters around what is grass-fed, corn-fed, pasture raised or organic.” 
The discussion comes as grass-fed beef has grown in popularity as health-conscious consumers increasingly seek fresher cuts of meat through farm-to-table programs that promise no preservatives, no hormone injections and no GMOs.
Dickey, who is a peach farmer, unveiled his idea back in April in the waning days of the 2025 legislative  session that saw a similar labeling bill targeting the shrimp industry gain traction in the House before dying in the Senate.
HB 117 mandated that restaurants verify on menus the source of shrimp as a means of transparency for consumers. If approved, its authors – including Reps. Jesse Petrea, Savannah Republican and Al Williams, a Midway Democrat – hoped it would also help the state’s beleaguered shrimp industry, which has struggled in recent years against foreign competitors with cheaper labor costs. 
The House passed the bill 165-7, but the measure failed to retain its momentum in the Senate. 
Dickey said he does not yet have details on the shape of the possible legislation, such as how “grass-fed” would be defined, what farmers would need to prove to qualify for certification or if there are costs associated with the inspections.
At this point, he wants input from consumers, beef producers and the cattle industry on what they would like to see in legislation if he were to make a formal proposal. The state Department of Agriculture could also play an advisory role if he finds the feedback persuades him to move forward.
“We want to make something that is workable for the ranchers and the cattlemen,” he said. “We don’t want to restrict, we want to make sure consumers understand what they are getting.” 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture used to regulate the labeling of grass-fed beef but stepped back from that role in 2016, University of Georgia professor of beef and cattle Lawton Stewart said. Third-party inspectors such as the American Grassfed Association, Food Alliance and A Greener World stepped in to fill the void.
The challenge the industry faces is defining grass-fed beef, Stewart said. Most cattle are raised eating grass but may be switched over to grain to fatten them up before processing. Others that are “grass-finished” can eat grain earlier in their lives but may be switched to an all-grass diet before they are processed.
“It comes down really to what tastes better to you, because grass-fed and grain-fed do taste different,” he said. “It comes down to the fat profile. The grass creates a different fatty acid profile compared to grain. And typically grass-fed is leaner because there are fewer calories in their diet.”
Dickey’s proposal received a mixed reaction from beef producers in the state. 
Will Harris, owner of White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, a leader in the grass-fed beef industry, said he’s all for transparency, but thinks the industry is already overwhelmed with labels. A better option would be to create more uniformity in how grass-fed beef is marketed and to ensure that beef raised in other countries is properly identified for consumers.
“Transparency is more than a label,” said Harris, who added that he invites consumers to see how cattle are raised on his farm in person. “We have an open-door policy.”
Fernando Mendez of Marview Farms in Arabi agreed. He said for the labeling to be effective, the public needs to be educated on the difference between grass-fed, grass-finished, grain-fed and other methods of raising cattle. 
“The way we talk about it is grass-fed, grass finished,” he said, adding that most people just hear grass-fed but aren’t aware there is more to it. “That’s a misinterpretation.”
Phillip Bridges, who operates Lexington-based The Georgia Beef Company with his brother Alan Bridges, said he opposes a state-mandated inspection. He already participates in the state’s Georgia Grown program, which works with farms to make sure their product is safe and trustworthy before giving a seal of approval. 
Adding another layer of inspection appears to him to be more government bureaucracy, he said. 
“If someone has a problem with my meat, they talk to me,” he said, adding that grass-fed producers lose customers if they are falsely identifying their product. “I’m not willing to do a third-party verification. I don’t see the need to pay someone to tell my customers I’m telling the truth.”
Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper said he will work with state leaders if this proposal becomes law in the future. Right now, the discussion is in its infancy, he said, and the road map is unclear. 
Legislation will have to balance the needs of the consumer and the producer and take into consideration production costs for farmers, Harper said.
“At the end of the day it’s about fairness to consumers and it’s about fairness to farmers and ensuring that the products are not deceptively labeled,” he said.

(Photo: Getty Images)Over the last 87 years – particularly during the 20th Century – few innovations in the American economy have done more to lift up average working people than the minimum wage.
As it was first conceived and applied, the federal minimum wage law sought to assure that a person who worked full-time was paid enough to support their family. And for many decades, the minimum wage actually worked that way for many people.
Unfortunately, in recent decades—thanks to opposition from corporate America and its allies on the political right—the federal minimum wage has long since ceased providing a living wage. Indeed, it’s now been more than 16 years since the minimum wage was raised to $7.25 per hour—a rate that was inadequate in 2009 and that is downright absurd in 2025.
But wait, it gets worse. If you’re someone who works for tips, the minimum wage (the so-called sub-minimum wage) is an astonishing $2.13 per hour.
Not surprisingly, as journalist Eyal Press reported in a recent New Yorker magazine article entitled “’No taxes on tips’ is an industry plant,” “the poverty rate among tipped workers is more than double the rate of other employees. Tipped workers are also more likely to rely on food stamps and other federal assistance.”
And while many states and cities have gone ahead and raised their minimum wages to much higher levels in recent years, in most others—including North Carolina—it’s still legal to pay the pitiful sums of $7.25 and $2.13 per hour. In case you don’t have a calculator handy, those wages would provide gross annual sub-poverty incomes for a full-time worker of $15,080 and $4,430.
All of which brings us to the latest conservative scam to keep the federal minimum wages at their current inadequate levels: the “no taxes on tips” law.
As you’ve probably heard by now, one of the provisions in the massive budget reconciliation bill passed by Republicans in Congress and signed into law by President Trump on July 4 alters federal law to mirror a gimmick floated by Trump during the 2024 campaign by exempting tips from federal income taxes.
North Carolina House Republicans proposed a similar provision in their version of a state budget earlier this year.
One must admit that it’s a superficially appealing idea. After all, the notion that a waitress scrambling to get by on tips and a legal wage $2.13 per hour would be required to pay income taxes is undeniably crazy.
But, of course, as is the case with so many proposals floated by Trump, a closer look reveals that there’s much less there than initially meets the eye.
As researchers at the Economic Policy Institute and North Carolina Budget and Tax Center have documented in a pair of recent briefs, the “no taxes on tips” idea benefits comparatively few workers.
Analysis from EPI shows that the law will benefit between 2.5 and 5.2 million tipped workers who will receive an income tax deduction before the policy expires in 2028. The average tax benefit would amount to $1,700 annually during the four years the bill would be in effect. Notably, however, the policy would disproportionately benefit the top 20 percent of all tipped workers, who would receive an average tax cut of over $5,700. Because so many tipped workers have incomes too low to have any federal income tax liability, the bottom 20 percent of all tipped workers would receive an annual average tax cut of just $74.
Meanwhile, the BTC reports that the North Carolina House proposal would provide tipped workers with a maximum annual tax savings of just under $200.
In contrast, a bill introduced in Congress earlier this year to incrementally raise the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2030 while doing away with the sub-minimum wage (“The Raise the Wage Act”) would benefit nearly 23 million workers (or about 15% of the workforce) with an average annual boost in wages of $3,200. All told, workers would realize a $70 billion gain in wages.
Industry lobbyists—particularly for the restaurant industry—claim of course that such a change will lead to economic Armageddon, but as economist Michael Reich told the New Yorker’s Press, experience in jurisdictions that have already raised the minimum wage shows that that’s just not the case. Yes, a higher minimum wage will cause restaurant prices to rise to a degree and employment in the industry may decline slightly, but overall, workers will be much better off.
And more to the point, as Sally Hodges Copple of the BTC told me in a recent interview, the vast majority of struggling low-income workers in desperate need of a raise (e.g. child care workers, retail workers) do not receive tips.
In short, the answer to what plagues low-income workers in our country—whether they work for tips or not—is to once again make the minimum wage a living wage. The decision of conservative law and policy makers to promote a low-impact scheme like “no taxes on tips” is just the latest in an endless line of scams designed to distract from what really matters, and ultimately, to keep wages for working people unjustly low.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Getty_tax-tips-1024x687.jpg,,,2025-08-12 04:56:22.387667

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters).State officials will get an updated look at Maryland’s revenue picture in a month, but the leader of the Maryland Senate expressed confidence Monday that the state is prepared — at least in the near term – to weather the as-yet-unrealized fallout of ongoing federal budget actions.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said delays in implementation of recently passed federal budget cuts and employee reductions, and ongoing court challenges to policies implemented by President Donald Trump (R) will have some negative effect on the current budget year.
“We’re expecting to see negative numbers as compared to year over year, but we had built those into our projections,” Ferguson told reporters Monday.
The comments came after a 70-minute briefing for the Joint Federal Action Oversight Committee that Ferguson co-chairs with House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County). The two appointed the joint committee this spring, after a legislative session where lawmakers crafted a fiscal 2026 budget that closed a projected $3.3 billion deficit by cobbling together shifts of funds from dedicated sources, sales and income tax increases, and some modest budget cuts.
They appointed the committee amid worries about how Trump’s slashing of federal aid, agencies and employment would affect Maryland. At the time, a return by lawmakers to Annapolis to deal with a worsening budget situation, possibly as early as September, was seen as likely.
But the effects of many of the cuts in Republicans’ One, Big Beautiful Bill, including billions in cuts to Medicaid, have been delayed until after the 2026 election. Also delayed, for now, are the expected impacts of federal workforce reductions and cuts to other federal aid and grants.
Federal job losses jumped to 12,700 in Maryland, most of any state

“Now my expectation is that that does not last forever, and that eventually those court cases and grievance policy protocols will end and those terminations will move forward,” Ferguson said of federal job cuts put in motion by Trump. “But that’s not where we are right now, and so, you know, we have to watch all of this with kind of an eye towards a cautious future.”
Some of that cautious optimism clings to the hope that budget projections made earlier this year will hold for now.
“My expectation is that we will see some level of alignment with our expectation of where we thought we would be,” Ferguson said.
But he and others continue to be concerned about the long-term impact federal budget changes will have on the state’s economy and budget priorities.
Federal jobs make up roughly 6% of all jobs in the state. One of every $10 in wages in the state is tied to $150 billion in annual federal spending, according to a briefing by the Office of the Comptroller.
“Here in Maryland, losses at the federal level are adding up … really threatening our middle class,” Comptroller Brooke Lierman told the joint panel Monday.
In June, the state recorded a loss of 8,500 jobs. More than 40% of those were in the federal government.
Lierman said the decrease represents “the largest single-month drop in federal government positions in Maryland in three decades.” Additionally, she said the 13,000 federal jobs lost since January has surpassed the number of jobs lost during federal sequestration.
“Maryland is really under economic assault from Washington, and the numbers are really staggering, whether it’s the budget reconciliation bill, tariffs or more, there’s so much happening every day,” Lierman said. “But the first step is really to quantify how these various changes will impact Maryland’s economy.”
The comptroller’s office is in the process of examining how more than 100 provisions in Trump’s tax-cut bill will affect the state. That report is expected in early September prior to the updated revenue estimates.
Also unknown, for now, are the ancillary impacts of federal cuts.
“How is that going to affect, you know, the food services industry and indirect economic impacts,” said Deputy Comptroller Ben Siegel. “Obviously we know those are very real as well.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Although the odds indicate regulators will OK the first black bear hunt in a decade in Florida, opponents will pull out all the rhetorical stops when the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) gathers this week in North Florida for a final vote.
FWC commissioners voted 4-1 in May to give preliminary approval to a 23-day bear hunt, tentatively proposed for December, plus annual hunts from October through December beginning in 2026.
The bear population in Florida is estimated at around 4,050 — but the agency came up with that estimate as long ago as 2015, the last time a bear hunt took place. That hunt was shut down at the end of just its second day after nearly 300 bears had been killed.
Those bears are spread out across the state in seven areas known as Bear Management Units (BMUs) by the FWC.  In justifying the hunt, the FWC has said that, since 2015, the four largest subpopulations of bears have grown annually and no subpopulations have shown evidence of decline.
The plan as approved in May is to remove 187 bears from four “bear hunting zones” — 68 in the East Panhandle; 46 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in the South hunting area.
As of now, permits would be issued through a random drawing and cost $100 for a Florida resident and $300 for those from out of state. The applications for those permits would cost $5.
Under plan approved by FWC Commissioners in May, hunters could use dogs to assist them and take bears at game feeding stations, using food to bait the animals.
Responsible or not?
Maria Davidson is large-carnivore program manager for the Safari Club International Foundation. She says the plan as conceived by the FWC is  responsible.
“The number of tags being issued in Florida is at a level that doesn’t even stop the population growth. It has the intent of slowing the population growth with wildlife populations similar to trying to navigate large-scale changes in direction,” she said while speaking with this reporter on WMNF 88.5 FM in Tampa on Friday.
“Bear populations don’t really self-regulate. Bears will take advantage of any food sources available, whether it be human-caused or not, and they will continue to grow in their core areas and just spill into unsuitable habitat,” Davidson continued.
“So, in order to slow that, you slow the population growth, which is exactly what FWC has done, and it was the recommendations from the biologists within the FWC to do that.”
James Scott serves on the executive committee of the Suncoast Sierra Club. He says the FWC has actually created “a bait and switch” in their proposal. Once finalized, the agency would allow more individuals to hunt and kill bears than those who participate through the lottery. 
A close look  in the FWC’s proposed hunt rules issued in May reveals language that, starting on Jan. 1, 2026, the FWC would create a “Private Lands Bear Harvest Program” that would permit landowners to hunt bear on their properties. 
The FWC would furnish one bear harvest tag for a property between 5,000 and 15,000 acres with at least up to five individual bears on the land; up to two bear tags for properties of between 15,000 and 25,000 acres with at least 10 bears; and a maximum of three tags for properties of more than 25,000 acres with at least 15 bears. The season would run from Oct. 1 through Dec. 31.
“Mark my words, if these rules pass as written, if they don’t cap or eliminate that program over time, that private-lands program will be the name of the game, and if you’re a hunter that wants to kill a bear in Florida, you’re going to have to go to a private landowner and fork over thousands of dollars to engage in a luxury bear-killing experience,” Scott said.
Davidson argues that’s not that big of a problem.
“The fact that FWC is choosing a mechanism that allows private landowners to benefit from the wildlife that they support out of their own pocket, to me, is not a negative thing, it’s just an additional opportunity or an alternative opportunity,” she said.
Public opinion doesn’t support a hunt

Public opinion polls show that Floridians don’t support a bear hunt. 
In a survey conducted by the FWC of more than 13,000 self-selected participants, 75% opposed the proposal, with just 23% in support. Other polls, such as a Remington Research survey commissioned by the Humane World for Animals, showed that 81% of Florida residents oppose the reopening of bear-hunting season.
On Saturday, protests against a bear hunt took place across the state,  all organized by the group Bear Defenders.
In Tampa, about a dozen people gathered at 10 a.m. on Saturday in the city’s Westshore area. Heidi Henson, a resident of Largo, said she was disappointed the public’s disdain for such an event doesn’t appear to be registering with FWC commissioners.
“I would say that you should really try to represent the people of this state and their viewpoints and that the majority of people believe that the hunts are cruel and unnecessary,” she said when asked what she would say to a commissioner if she had the opportunity.
“There are issues with bears encroaching on human habitation, [but] there are better ways of dealing with it other than a hunt. Trophy hunting is not okay.”
Isabelle Tassi with Bear Defenders said she wants people to call FWC commissioners and Gov. Ron DeSantis and tell them there’s no reason for a bear hunt. She condemned the equipment and tactics that FWC commissioners have already approved if there is a hunt.
“They want to use baiting, they want to use dogs, and they want to use bows and arrows, which are extraordinarily cruel, and there’s simply no reason for that. We need to leave the bears alone and not kill them and not use those horrific methods on them.”
Of the 40 states with black bear populations, 34 have regulated bear hunting seasons, according to the FWC.
The vote on whether the hunt will take place is scheduled for the FWC’s next quarterly meeting to be held on Wednesday and Thursday in Havana, in Gadsden County. If it is approved, the hunt will last three weeks, between Dec. 6 and Dec. 28.

Ned Lamont will be tempted to move funds from the hard-won opioid settlements to fill the gaps. This temptation should be resisted.,"Since the start of Donald Trump’s second presidency, we have been bombarded with news of reductions in federal funding for programs that provide critical services to Connecticut residents. These include cuts to disaster response, Medicaid, libraries, job programs, and more.
As the federal government pulls back funding, the General Assembly and Gov. Ned Lamont will be tempted to move funds from the hard-won opioid settlements to fill the gaps. This temptation should be resisted. The opioid crisis is ongoing and devastating.
Over the last decade, Connecticut has averaged over 1,000 overdose deaths a year. Treatment of opioid addiction and harm reduction are proven interventions that can reduce overdose deaths, yet only one in five receive evidence-based care. Behind these numbers are lives lost, families broken, and communities left struggling. Today, many of these patients still face barriers to care. These barriers will increase with the actions of the Trump administration and Congress to decrease funding for Medicaid and addiction services.
Connecticut will receive $720 million dollars from settlements prosecuted by Attorney General William Tong against drug companies, distributors, and retail pharmacies. These settlements are meant to serve a clear purpose: reduce opioid-related deaths and invest in prevention, treatment, and substance use recovery. The explicit goal is to address the continuing harms from an earlier era of opioid overprescribing and support people suffering from addiction and their families.
To guide use of the funds, the state established by statute an Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee. As a group of addiction physicians and researchers, and by invitation of the Committee, we generated a report summarizing the best evidence on efficacious interventions to address the harms of opioid use. To date the Committee has funded increases in harm reduction services, a statewide naloxone saturation plan, mobile treatment vans, recovery housing, and other interventions. Early signs show these efforts are making a difference. In 2024, Connecticut saw a decline in overdose deaths. This is a hopeful sign, but only the beginning, as every day we still lose, on average, three to four people to opioids. Now, this budding progress is in jeopardy.
Guardrails were built into the settlements negotiated by Attorney General Tong, and enshrined in state law, to avoid a replay of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which brought more than $2 billion to the state. Only 10% of those funds went to anti-smoking efforts, while Connecticut lawmakers siphoned the rest away to non-tobacco related services to balance the state budget. Today, while tobacco still kills 4,900 people annually in Connecticut, the state spends none of its tobacco funds on tobacco control. The change in federal funding puts us in danger of repeating the same mistake with the opioid settlements.
This threat is not abstract. During the last budget negotiation Governor Lamont proposed dipping into the opioid settlement to circumvent the Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee. While Lamont’s proposal was ultimately unsuccessful, similar efforts to supplant funds by lawmakers in New Jersey successfully diverted $45 million dollars  into state hospital systems for services unrelated to addressing the opioid crisis. Nationally recognized guidance on the appropriate and ethical use of opioid settlement funds expressly recommends the prohibition of supplantation.  Furthermore, supplantation undermines settlement terms which specifically call for their use to remediate the harms of opioid use and threatens to erode public trust.
To be sure, federal funding decisions will force hard decisions in our state on how to fund crucial services, but the opioid settlements were never meant to be a pressure relief valve for the state budget when general fund deficits arise. These settlements are a form of justice. It is through investing in harm reduction and addiction treatment that lives will be saved and a stronger public health system built. The stakes could not be higher. The opioid crisis is not over. As the drug supply continues to evolve and overdoses remain a leading cause of death, politics cannot be allowed to interfere with progress. The opioid settlement funds should be utilized for the purpose they were created: helping the people who were harmed by the opioid crisis.
Today, Connecticut has a second chance at correctly utilizing settlement funds. This is not a moment for business as usual. It is a test on whether the state has learned from the past or whether it is willing to allow history to repeat itself.

While these actions are often framed as a political move against green energy, they are creating a storm of economic uncertainty and sparking legal battles that could define the future of clean power in the United States.  This issue is less about politics and more about fiscal prudence, energy security, and job creation. 

William Sweet
Federal policies on wind energy are creating significant uncertainty, and the effects are rippling all the way to Connecticut.  While the conversation often becomes polarized, a closer look at the economic realities reveals a compelling case for a collaborative, pragmatic approach that benefits communities, businesses, and taxpayers alike.
The decision by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to rescind all designated wind energy areas for “speculative wind development” is not just a distant federal policy — it is an immediate threat to Connecticut’s clean energy goals.  
The state has made significant commitments to a zero-carbon electricity supply by 2040, a goal that relies heavily on a diversified energy portfolio.  Instead of presenting wind as a replacement for other energy sources, it is a key component of an “all-of-the-above” energy solution that enhances energy independence and grid reliability.  With the cancellation of future lease sales off the coasts of states like New York and in the central Atlantic, the entire development pipeline for the Northeast is at risk.
The potential benefits of offshore wind for Connecticut are substantial and multifaceted.  From an economic standpoint, the industry is poised to be a powerful engine for growth.  The state has already made strategic investments, most notably the $310 million upgrade to the New London State Pier Terminal, transforming it into a vital East Coast hub for staging and assembly of wind turbines.  This investment has yielded immediate results, creating many local union jobs and laying the groundwork for a robust supply chain.  A recent study by the Connecticut Wind Collaborative found that more than 50 Connecticut companies are already participating in active offshore wind projects, with another 450 companies having the potential to join this expanding sector.  This translates into job stability and a skilled workforce prepared for the energy challenges of tomorrow.
Beyond jobs and direct investment, offshore wind offers a solution to the state’s high and volatile electricity costs.  Unlike natural gas, which is susceptible to price spikes, wind has no fuel costs.  This allows wind power to be bid into the wholesale electricity market at a near-zero price, creating a “price suppression” effect that can lower the market price for all electricity generators.  A study by Synapse Energy Economics estimates that procuring 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2030 could reduce electricity bills for New England customers by as much as $1.7 billion annually under high gas price scenarios.  For the average Connecticut household, this could mean an annual decrease in electricity bills of approximately $108 to $139.
From an environmental and public health perspective, the benefits are equally compelling.  Offshore wind produces virtually no climate pollution during operation, a stark contrast to the state’s continued reliance on fossil fuels.  Achieving the tri-state 9 GW offshore wind goal would cut 42% of annual CO2 emissions from the New England power sector and provide an estimated $362 million in annual public health benefits by reducing harmful emissions that contribute to respiratory conditions like asthma.
The stakes for Connecticut are high.  The state has already seen the tangible benefits of offshore wind with the opening of the South Fork wind farm, the nation’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, a project that demonstrates the potential for local job creation and a transition to a cleaner economy.  
The administration’s latest actions and those of Congress threaten to stall or cancel these kinds of projects, putting future jobs in the wind-energy sector at risk and potentially leading to higher electricity rates as the state is forced to rely on more volatile and expensive energy sources.  
In response, Connecticut’s Attorney General William Tong has joined a lawsuit with 16 other states and the District of Columbia to challenge the administration’s executive order, arguing it is a harmful and illegal obstruction of progress.  This lawsuit is not just a political protest, but a matter of fiscal prudence — a prudent defense of the state’s economic investments and future tax revenue, helping to restore the leasing and permitting processes, allowing developers to move forward with projects that have been in the works for years.
According to a project tracker at Cleanview, wind developers have planned 790 projects totaling 213 GW of power capacity, representing $317 billion in potential investment.  Interestingly, the economic fallout from these actions would be disproportionately felt in Republican-led states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa, which are major hubs for wind energy.  This creates a compelling narrative where a policy aimed at a political opponent’s “green” agenda is now threatening a significant economic blow to states that are key to the administration’s support. 
 Ultimately, a diverse domestic energy supply, including wind, is a matter of national security, as it reduces reliance on volatile foreign energy sources.

Wes Moore (D) as the difference between those who say they approve of the job the first-term executive is doing and those who disapprove continues to shrink. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Troubling poll news continues for Gov. Wes Moore (D) in a new survey that shows approval numbers for the first-term executive continue to slip and the gap between those who approve and disapprove of his performance continues to shrink.
The Maryland Now poll is the most recent of several over the last nine months that have shown a continued softening of support for the charismatic first-term governor.
Five in 10 surveyed in the latest poll said they approved of the job done by Moore. But the gap between those who approve and disapprove of the governor’s performance narrowed to 8 percentage points — a drop of 13 percentage points in six months.
The poll — conducted by Blended Public Affairs and powerhouse Annapolis lobbying firm Perry Jacobson — surveyed 1,256 Maryland residents by text message between July 24 and July 30. The poll has a margin of error of 2.7 percentage points.
The poll said 21% of those surveyed said Moore was doing an excellent job, down from 27% in February. Those who described Moore’s job performance as “not so good” remained statistically flat at 13% but those who rated Moore’s job performance as “poor” grew from 21% in February to 29% in the current poll.
The Maryland Now poll is the third this year to show the gap between approval and disapproval narrowing.
Moore fared better in the survey than President Donald Trump (R) and Maryland General Assembly Democrats and Republicans.
Trump, who lost Maryland in the 2024 election, remains unpopular in the state where registered Democrats outnumber Republican voters by a roughly 2-1 margin: Just 33% said they approve of the job Trump is doing.

	But Democrats, the supermajority in the Maryland House and Senate, are also unpopular. Nearly four respondents in 10 said they disapproved of the job done by Democratic state lawmakers as a group. Just about 30% approved of the job done by Republican lawmakers in Annapolis.
Since the end of legislative session, Moore has been the subject of a series of ads attempting to improve his image. Those ads are paid for by a group tied to the Democratic Governors Association. Last month, the association heavily promoted a poll conducted by Morning Consult that claimed Moore was one of the 10 most popular governors in the country, with a 31 percentage point gap between his approval and disapproval numbers.
But those figures bucked the trend of polls taken by traditional pollsters earlier this year.
Moore. a charismatic leader with no political record, entered office in January 2023. In May 2023, he boasted a 53% approval number in a survey released by the Sarah T. Hughes Center for Politics at Goucher College. Notable in that poll was the 27-percentage point difference between those who approved of Moore’s performance and those who did not.
The last year for Moore has been more difficult.
In March, Moore maintained a 55% job approval rating in a poll released by Annapolis-based Gonzales Research & Media. In that survey, the difference between those approving of Moore’s performance and those who did not approve fell to 19 percentage points compared to a poll conducted two months earlier.
Moore had a similar showing in a February poll by the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. In that survey, the governor maintained a 52% job approval number but the difference in his approval and disapproval numbers shrank to 12 percentage points. Three months earlier, the same poll gave Moore a 22-percentage point cushion.
The 2025 session was the most challenging so far for Moore who faced a $3.3 billion structural budget deficit.
The poll released Monday found voters are generally pessimistic. Roughly two-thirds of those surveyed said the country is on the wrong track. Fifty-four percent have a negative view of Maryland’s economy and 67% said the amount of taxes paid in Maryland is “too high.”
Even so, 59% of voters in the poll appear to lay more of the blame on Trump and Republicans in Congress. One in four blamed Moore.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0377-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 23:56:37.133895

Tyler Dees (R-Siloam Springs) asks a question during a meeting on Grant Hardin's escape from the North Central Unit, taken on Aug. 11, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)An automated inmate classification system incorrectly identified a former police chief and convicted murderer as a medium-risk prisoner for “five to six” years, Arkansas Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne told a legislative panel Monday.
Grant Hardin — a convicted rapist and murderer who was previously a state prison guard and small-town police chief — should have been given a high-risk classification but was not, Payne told the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Charitable, Penal and Correctional Institutions subcommittee.
Hardin, 56, escaped on May 25 from the North Central Unit at Calico Rock. Hardin should have been held in a higher security facility, Payne said. He was transferred to the Varner SuperMax Unit near Gould after his capture on June 6.
“Without an override, he should not have been there” at Calico Rock, Payne said.
Other corrections officials told lawmakers at a previous committee hearing that the North Central Unit housed both some serious felons as well as medium-risk inmates.
Lawmakers challenge Arkansas prison officials over escape of convicted murderer-rapist

Payne said the division’s classification office is supposed to review inmate classifications “at least yearly” to ensure that the system’s risk assessments are accurate.
“The system calculates the score,” Payne said. In order for a prisoner with a score that marked them as a high-security prisoner to stay at a medium security prison like Calico Rock, “the warden, the deputy director or myself would have to override that to keep him there.”
Hardin escaped from Calico Rock while working in the prison kitchen. A kitchen manager allowed him to go to the kitchen’s loading dock unsupervised, a violation of prison policy. Using a marker, Hardin dyed a white prison uniform black to make it look like a guard’s uniform. A tower guard allowed Hardin to walk out of the prison’s back gate without verifying his identity.
His escape prompted a manhunt by local, state and federal law enforcement. Searchers found him hiding in dense woods less than two miles from the prison.
Corrections officials fired the kitchen manager and the guard immediately after the escape, Payne said. He told lawmakers Monday that he stood by those dismissals. Other employees have been suspended or demoted in connection with lapses that led to Hardin’s escape, he said.
Payne said more searches of the back dock and the outdoor areas of the prison would be conducted going forward. The correction division also changed their procedure for opening gates to prevent a similar mistake from happening in the future, he said.
“I think that’s where we failed at this point, at this facility. The back dock area was not searched enough, or they would have probably found that [Hardin] was hiding items out there,” Payne said.


Let us know what you think...


 

Subcommittee co-chair Rep. Howard Beaty, Jr., R-Crossett criticized Payne and department staff for not taking more responsibility for the prison break.
“When there’s a breakdown or a failure of my employees to execute the instructions and the plans that I have given, some of that responsibility falls on me,” Beaty said.
“I’m the person that’s in front of you today because I am overall responsible,” Payne responded.
When Rep. Justin Gonzales, R-Okolona, asked if someone within the department entered something incorrectly into the system to prompt the inaccurate classification, Payne said they still weren’t sure.
“We don’t know yet how it didn’t calculate the score correctly,” he said.
He said they expected to discover that more inmates were incorrectly classified.
Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, was unsatisfied with the remaining unanswered questions about how Hardin escaped in his evaluation of the incident.
“Two things can be true. And those two things are, yeah, people didn’t do their job, but also there should be checks and balances to ensure that people do their job. Where are those checks and balances?” Gilmore said. “I know what the answer is going to be, and respectfully sir, I just don’t think that cuts it for me.”
Gilmore said he was still “boggled” by how Hardin got the markers to dye the uniform, and that there needed to be supervision. Outstanding questions like that, Gilmore added, needed to be answered.
“I have no idea. I don’t think you can even explain that, because you didn’t last time,” Gilmore said.
Hardin was sentenced to 80 years on murder and rape charges. He was convicted of the murder of a man in Gateway in 2017 and received 30 years. He later pled guilty to two counts of rape in 2019 after his DNA was a match in a 20-year-old cold case, and was sentenced to an additional 50 years in prison.

Burt Jones received the endorsement he was hoping for in his 2026 run for governor: that of President Donald Trump.
“Burt Jones for Governor has my Complete and Total Endorsement – HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Monday evening.
Jones relished the attention in a post featuring a picture of him standing next to a thumbs-up-giving Trump.
“We’re fighting for election integrity, lower taxes, and to secure Georgia values — and with Trump’s support, we’re just getting started,” Jones’ post read.
Jones was an early backer of Trump’s first campaign in 2016, and among his most ardent supporters following Trump’s loss in 2020.
Then a state senator, Jones was one of 16 Republicans who signed certificates falsely pronouncing Trump the winner in Georgia. He also pushed Gov. Brian Kemp to call a special legislative session to overturn the election results.
Last year, a special prosecutor concluded that charges should not be brought against Jones.
Jones continued to support Trump and appeared beside him at Georgia rallies through the 2024 election.
The endorsement hardly comes as a surprise given the closeness between the two men, but it could be a major boon in May’s Republican primary. The only other announced high-profile Republican candidate is Attorney General Chris Carr.
Despite dwindling popularity among independent voters, Trump enjoys near-universal support among Republicans – an April Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found about 85% of Georgia Republicans support Trump.
Democrats, led by candidates like state Sen. Jason Esteves of Atlanta, former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and former DeKalb County CEO Mike Thurmond, are likely hoping that Jones’ snuggling up to Trump in the primary could hurt him in a general election. Despite the strong showing among GOP faithful, the same AJC poll showed Trump’s overall approval rating in Georgia at a meager 43%, with the majority of those disapproving identifying as independents.
Jones also likely carries a financial advantage – Carr is suing Jones alleging that a special campaign finance structure called a leadership committee allows Jones to flaunt fundraising limits imposed upon other candidates.
But Carr’s campaign shrugged off the endorsement.
“Chris Carr is the only conservative Republican who can win the primary and the general election,” said spokesperson Julia Mazzone in a statement Monday night. “The Attorney General will continue to work with President Trump now and as Governor on the issues that matter to hardworking Georgians.”
Carr ruffled Trump’s feathers after his 2020 loss by declining to sign on to efforts to overturn the election, but he has since sought to get back on the president’s good side.
A Trump endorsement has been seen as a golden ticket for a Republican seeking elected office, but a note from the big guy hasn’t always guaranteed success.
In 2022, Trump endorsed a slate of primary candidates up and down Georgia ballots, most of whom went home losers on election night – and that included John Gordon, who went up against Carr but lost by more than 47% of the vote.

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)The Montana Public Service Commission will be scheduling a meeting soon to gather information on data centers following a series of recent announcements about new operations in the Treasure State.
PSC President Brad Molnar said Monday the commission will call on NorthWestern Energy to participate in the public meeting — expected to be scheduled in the coming weeks and also address AI — and outline its current and potential plans to support data centers.
NorthWestern Energy announced last month it had signed a letter of intent to “provide energy services” for Quantica Infrastructure’s proposed data center development in Montana.
NorthWestern said the energy load for Quantica’s first phase of development would be 500 megawatts. Quantica announced construction of the Big Sky Digital Infrastructure campus outside Billings would begin in 2026.
The announcement about the development in Billings comes on the heels of news other data centers are looking to open up shop in Montana — and the potential opportunities and problems those operators would bring.
NorthWestern Energy provides roughly 750 megawatts of power on average to existing Montana customers, and the new proposals would total at least 2,100 megawatts, according to the Montana Environmental Information Center.
Quantica Infrastructure, based in Texas, did not respond Monday to an email with questions about its plans including a specific location for its campus and number of people it plans to employ.
However, an economic researcher in Montana said data centers can create jobs with higher-than-average wages, albeit more so during construction phases, and they can make notable property tax contributions to government coffers.
But environmental advocates said the facilities will require significant energy and water for cooling, and existing customers should not have to foot the bill for the new data centers.
“If new generation and transmission infrastructure are being built to serve these data centers, Montana ratepayers should not be subsidizing those costs,” said Ben Catton, with the MEIC.
In an email, NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the utility will work toward ensuring new large customers pay their fair share.
“NorthWestern Energy is planning to pursue proactive steps to ensure new commercial large energy customers pay the cost of their integration and the services they require,” Black said. “We will work with the Montana Public Service Commission to ensure these new customers contribute equitably to the infrastructure and operational costs tied to their service.”
Energy use isn’t the only concern, though. Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, said she’s not an expert on data centers, but she pays attention to water because of the agriculture needs in her area, and data centers are heavy water users.
At a recent meeting of the Water Policy Interim Committee, Gillette, who is not on the committee, suggested the group study how data centers will affect water supplies.
Gillette said Monday she hopes related legislative studies on water and energy can guide lawmakers in the future when it comes to data centers.
“I want to believe there’s a pathway for moving forward because the data centers aren’t going away,” Gillette said to the Daily Montanan. “That’s a fact.”
 ***

On July 30, NorthWestern Energy announced it had signed a letter of intent — as NorthWestern Energy Group — to support Quantica Infrastructure, including an initial load of 500 megawatts and potential growth of up to 1 gigawatt.
The news release said NorthWestern was conducting a transmission study to assess how best to meet the company’s needs. It also said Quantica “has several generation projects in development” along with infrastructure that would integrate with the existing grid.
In its own news release, Quantica said its capacity would be 500 megawatts of renewable power and battery storage initially for its “5,000-acre energy, real estate and telecommunications campus.”
NBC Montana reported Quantica plans to build up to 1 gigawatt of on-site renewable generation.
In a statement, NorthWestern President and CEO Brian Bird said the “collaboration” reflects the utility’s commitment to “innovation,” economic development and delivering high-quality energy services.
“We’re actively working with Quantica to optimize the transmission infrastructure and generation resources needed to support this project,” Bird said in a statement. “Montana’s clean energy portfolio, reliable grid, and competitive rates make it an attractive location for new industries.”
In a statement provided by NorthWestern, Quantica CEO John Chesser said the project would create “meaningful employment opportunities along with improvements in telecommunications and power infrastructure for Montanans.”
Chesser also said the development would use “resilient power backed by dedicated renewable energy.”
NorthWestern Energy said it anticipates it could provide service to Quantica “through its regulated business,” pending regulatory considerations. It said the approach “could improve cost efficiency” by spreading infrastructure expenses across “a broader customer base.”
 ***

MEIC, however, said ratepayers should not be subsidizing the costs of new generation and transmission infrastructure, and NorthWestern’s statement about spreading costs across more customers is “concerning.”
“We’re also alarmed by the avalanche of announcements of data centers coming to Montana,” said the MEIC’s Ben Catton in an email also citing environmental and health costs as a concern.
Catton outlined those announcements for an upcoming MEIC newsletter for the nonprofit, which advocates for clean and affordable energy.
Those include an announcement in December by NorthWestern to supply two data centers with a combined 400 MWs, including one the utility confirmed is a Sabey Data Center subsidiary in Butte; an announcement in June by TAC Data Center to build a data center in Great Falls that will require up to 600 MWs; and announcements last month by two more companies, Krambu with plans for a 100 MW facility, and Quantica, according to MEIC.
In an email, the MEIC’s Nick Fitzmaurice said the total generation needed for those projects would be roughly three times NorthWestern Energy’s current average output and require “massive capital investments into generation and grid infrastructure.”
“There is a theoretical scenario where costs are shared across these new customers in a way that puts downward pressure on other customers’ rates, but that seems to be an extremely unlikely outcome,” Fitzmaurice said in an email. “These data centers are shopping around to utilities across the country, looking for the best deal they can get on electricity.
“It is likely that many of these projected loads will never be built if these companies jump from Montana to wherever else they can get a better deal. If NWE does entice them to build here, it would likely be through preferential electricity contracts that would subsidize data center energy on the backs of other customers, not the other way around.”
 ***

PSC President Molnar said the PSC’s job at the upcoming meeting will be to investigate the information NorthWestern provides so it can make decisions on any related rules that are needed based on the facts.
“It’s our job to be prepared and to drill down on what they say,” Molnar said.
He also said it will be important to hear directly from NorthWestern Energy’s top leader about the utility’s plans, not just from its lobbyists.
“I don’t care what they say. I want to know what he says,” Molnar said.
He said a special rate classification might be in order for data centers to ensure they pay their fair share. Molnar also said it’s important that wholly owned subsidiaries of private companies don’t end up putting other ratepayers at risk, or “bleed back on customers.”
Even though Quantica plans to build renewable energy to service AI and its data center, he said, it needs instantaneous backup with natural gas in order to not lose data in an emergency.
 ***

Although the data centers come with risks and high energy demands, Jeff Michael, with the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana, said they also represent economic development.
Michael said the construction phase can bring significant employment, and the data centers themselves bring permanent jobs, and they pay well.
“Especially in Montana, a couple hundred ongoing jobs that pay above average is certainly a benefit that can’t be ignored,” said Michael, who also noted he is not an expert in data centers.
Additionally, he said, the facilities pay high property taxes as “giant structures full of electronics” with a lot of value inside, he said. He said they can generate revenue for a local community “without generally putting huge demands on community infrastructure.”
As they evaluate locations, he said, those companies are looking at energy costs, the costs of development, and the operating and regulatory environment.
The industry is expanding nationwide and beyond, and the business climate might be in their favor in Montana, although it isn’t the first place they’re looking, he said.
“They’re looking for a lot of opportunities,” he said. “It’s probably a little less costly to operate here, and maybe somewhat less resistant than they might be getting in some other areas.”
At the Water Policy Interim Committee, at least a couple of legislators, including Reps. Jill Cohenour, D-Helena, and Terry Sharp, R-Lake County, agreed data centers should be part of the group’s upcoming work.
“How are we going to address these new commercial uses that are going to come online?” Cohenour said.
She said Gov. Greg Gianforte wants to provide incentives for such companies, and the committee should be prepared to talk about the implications.
Rep. Gillette, who wants to learn more about impacts on water, said the economic development potential reminds her of the tourism industry and questions it raises, such as whether Montana is being “loved to death.”
She said data centers come with a similar tension — and question.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)As Democratic Party leaders nationwide search for a rebuttal to President Donald Trump in next year’s midterms, voters in Washington state delivered one in the Aug. 5 primary.
Nine Democratic state lawmakers, all appointed, faced voters in essentially a referendum on their service and the path their party has been on. All nine won. 
Four faced experienced opponents in what were viewed as predictors of the political climate seven months into a second Trump administration, and after passage of tax hikes, budget cuts and liberal laws by the Democrat-controlled state Legislature. 
What transpired was not only a rebuke of Trump’s leadership, but also a blow to those pining to see the Democrat-led state Legislature temper its tax-and-spend ways. 
Progressive voters turned out in greater numbers than previous odd-year elections, a reflection of how Trump inspires his political opponents and of how this core constituency hasn’t wavered.
In two Senate contests, Democratic Sens. Deb Krishnadasan and Victoria Hunt held off state Rep. Michelle Caldier and former state lawmaker Chad Magendanz, respectively. 
The GOP challengers focused on what they consider to be the deleterious effects of the majority Democrats. The incumbent senators and their allies countered by associating the Republicans with Trump, his policies, or the MAGA movement.
A similar strategy played out in the House race between two Democrats, Rep. Edwin Obras, a progressive, and Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling. 
Schilling, the more centrist of the two, pledged to focus on rising costs, community safety and avoiding political extremism. As Obras trumpeted upholding the Democrats’ legislative agenda, his allies tagged Schilling as a MAGA accomplice because a political committee supporting him got money from a Trump supporter.
Meanwhile, in another all-Democrat race, Sen. Vandana Slatter, a liberal, beat Rep. Amy Walen, a moderate, by a double-digit margin. Slatter campaigned as the real Democrat, painting Walen as too business-friendly. Trump popped up in this contest, too, appearing in a mailer sent by a pro-Slatter group insisting the senator was on the “front lines” fighting the president.
Special interests operating independent of the candidates in these four marquee contests collectively spent $1.5 million trying to sway voters. While more money went to hammering the appointed Democrats, dollars used to knit a candidate — regardless of party — with Trump or the MAGA movement, paid dividends by deterring voters from that person.
The results show Trump continues to drag down Republican candidates in suburbia and progressives are in no mood to cede ground they’ve secured at the state level.
“Trump had a huge effect on this year’s primary and will continue to have a huge effect on this year’s election,” said veteran strategist Dean Nielsen of CN4 Partners in Seattle. “If there’s one thing that unites Democratic voters, it’s Donald Trump.”
For the appointed Democratic state lawmakers, winning the Aug. 5 primary was only the first step. To retain their seats, they’ll need to win again on Nov. 4.
‘We need to get our voters out’
Republicans set their sights this year on winning Senate seats in the 26th Legislative District spanning parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties and the 5th district in east King County. 
The duel between Krishnadasan, a former school board director, and Caldier, a six-term representative, is the Republicans’ best opportunity to gain ground in the chamber, where Democrats hold a 30-19 seat advantage. 
The campaign waged by Caldier focused on Democrats’ passage of billions in new business taxes, new social policies and a 6-cent per gallon gas tax hike. But she couldn’t overcome the counterpunches from a pro-Krishnadasan political committee linking her with Trump. After leading on election night, she now trails.
“These results show that voters are unhappy with the direction of politics in DC,” Caldier said in a text last week. “However, this race has everything to do with our quality of life here at home. The people in my community were just saddled with the largest tax increase in our state’s history. I’ll be spending the next three months telling that story and working to represent my neighbors who can’t afford what this supermajority keeps doing.”
In the 5th district, Hunt defended the Democrats’ approach on taxes and the budget as necessary to protect vital services in the face of threats from the policies of the president and congressional Republicans. She leads Magendanz by nearly 9%.
A typical mailer put out by a pro-Hunt political committee hit those themes – not her votes to raise taxes, boost fees and expand government regulation. She was portrayed as one who will stand up to Trump and labeled Magendanz as a “Republican extremist.”

Sen. Drew MacEwen, R-Shelton, chair of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, insisted there are still paths to victory for both candidates.
“I don’t think people are engaged yet. We need to get our voters out,” he said. As for a counterweight to Trump, he said “people are starting to wake up to the fact their pocketbook is impacted” by what Democrats did in session.
He also said, “if asked,” he would tell those backing pro-business candidates to “abandon” the 48th District. That’s where Slatter is beating Walen by a lot in an all-Democrat match-up.
The choice there is between someone who votes 100% of the time with the majority party and someone who votes 95% of the time, MacEwen said. Electing two business-friendly Republicans to the Senate would change the political math in that chamber, he said.
“Do we have our work cut out for us? Absolutely,” he said.
Democrat vs. Democrat and Trump still creeps in
It was in the 33rd District race where Obras’ backers hit Schilling with a mailer saying MAGA “found their man.”
The reason: Pragmatic Washington, a pro-Schilling political committee funded largely by the Washington State Dental Association, received a $10,000 contribution from Steve Gordon, a Republican business owner who has endorsed Trump policies.
Obras garnered nearly 47% in the primary to Schilling’s 31%. Republican Darryl Jones picked up 22%.
Schilling, the mayor of Burien, declined to comment on the mailer. But he’s banking on voters in November being less ideological and more moderate than those in the primary. More than half the voters did not support the representative, he said, adding that he still sees a lane to victory.
Jared Leopold of the New Direction political committee had a different take. The committee, which supports incumbent and progressive Democrats, is funded largely by the Democratic caucuses of the House and Senate, and statewide teacher and health care worker unions.
“Running against the Democrat agenda in Olympia is not a successful campaign strategy,” he said. “People want a fighter right now with Trump. People want a Democrat who is going to fight back.”
There are echoes here of what Shasti Conrad, chair of the Washington State Democratic Party, said in January in her breakdown of the 2024 election — a perspective that helped provide the springboard to her new leadership post with the national party.
Conrad argued the blueprint for Democrats’ success in Washington last year, including a sweep of nine statewide executive posts and gains in the Legislature, is one the party can use to win back control of Congress and the White House.
“Progressive policies are popular,” she wrote in her analysis. “When we can show our policies in action and make people’s lives better at the state level, we can win more elections.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 21:56:25.232001

Flood barriers have been installed since last year's flooding, but city officials are still asking for voluntary evacuations of the area. (Photo courtesy of City and Borough of Juneau)Officials in Alaska’s capital city are asking residents to voluntarily evacuate from parts of the Mendenhall Valley ahead of an expected glacial flood this week.
Last year’s flood damaged more than 290 homes in the valley, a largely suburban district of Juneau that is located near the Mendenhall Glacier, and while city officials have constructed temporary barriers to deter future flooding, those barriers haven’t yet been tested in an actual emergency.
“We are issuing those evacuation advisories, because although we are extremely confident in the HESCO barriers’ capability to protect neighborhoods, we’re not willing to bet on that with anybody’s life — or safety,” said Ryan O’Shaughnessy, director of emergency programs for the City and Borough of Juneau. 
The Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area, Alaska’s most-visited tourist destination, is preparing to shut down as well. The Nugget Falls Trail, the most-used pathway in the area, was closed to the public on Monday. 
Officials from the U.S. Forest Service, which operates the glacier tourist site, did not participate in a media briefing Monday. Agencies at that briefing said the Mendenhall Glacier is short-staffed. The recreation site experienced widespread layoffs as part of a broader federal reduction in force earlier this year.
Late Sunday night, cellphones across Juneau rang with warning tones as city officials sent out an alert: Water has begun to overtop an ice dam that allows the creation of a glacial lake each summer.
Officials expect that within a week, the water will gush from the dam and into Mendenhall Lake, which lays at the glacier’s foot. From there, water will surge into the Mendenhall River and toward homes. 
The first glacial outburst flood at Mendenhall Glacier happened in 2011, but the flooding was initially minor. Because the glacier is shrinking due to climate change, the floods have grown worse over time, culminating in last year’s disaster. 
Aaron Jacobs, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Juneau, said this year’s ice dam is lower by 13 feet than it was last year, but the glacial lake — located in a place called Suicide Basin — contains about as much water as it did last year because melting ice elsewhere has increased the capacity of the basin.
“We’re expecting very similar volume estimates from last year,” he said.
That volume, about 16 billion gallons, weighs almost 67 million tons, the equivalent weight of 335 fully loaded container ships rushing through a normally placid river. 
Eight inches of rain fell on and near the basin in recent days, Jacobs said, and hydrographs show that the level of Mendenhall Lake and River have risen.
That’s a little misleading: The lake and river will fall over the next few days as the rain diminishes, then will surge once the ice dam fails to contain the basin. 
It isn’t clear how bad the resulting flood will be. That depends on things as varied as the tide, rainfall and the success or failure of the flood barriers.
O’Shaughnessy said officials will send out another emergency text alert to Juneau cellphones before the peak flood. 
An emergency evacuation shelter has been set up at nearby Floyd Dryden school, and both state and local officials have issued preemptive disaster declarations as a precaution.

(Photo courtesy of the University of Idaho).A stalled legislative proposal this year that would have dismantled a decades-long partnership for Idaho medical students eventually led to a working group looking at increasing medical education in the Gem State. 
The Idaho Medical Education Working Group — made up of two legislators and stakeholders from the Idaho Hospital Association, Idaho Medical Association, Idaho State Board of Education, Idaho’s current medical education programs, and a physician from the state Graduate Medical Education Committee — met for the first time Monday at the Capitol in Boise. 
  Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, speaks from the House floor on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Co-Chair Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, said at the meeting that the group was formed as a continuation of a discussion started during the 2025 legislative session, and the goal is to create a plan to expand medical education opportunities for Idaho students. 
“All of us have a passion to address our physician shortage in Idaho,” Manwaring said Monday. “It’s frankly, in my opinion, a crisis.” 
Manwaring during the legislative session introduced House Bill 176, which would have ended Idaho’s partnership with the University of Washington Medical School through WWAMI, which stands for Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho, and moved seats to another medical school program. Manwaring cited frustration with UW over not expanding the number of Idaho seats by 10, as the Legislature asked it to in 2022, and a long delay in signing an amended contract agreeing not to include abortion training in Idaho students’ education. 
The bill sparked strong backlash from health care providers, clinical instructors, and current and former students from the program. 
Amid the backlash, Manwaring introduced a new bill that instead directed the state to look into adding more seats for Idaho students in other programs, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. House Bill 368 originally would have also cut 10 seats from WWAMI, but was later amended so that the existing program would remain intact. 
As a result of HB 368, which was signed into law in April, the group is tasked with creating a plan for the governor and Legislature to reduce Idaho’s physician shortage, link graduate and undergraduate medical education, maintain and increase high quality programs for Idaho’s medical students, keep more money spent on medical education within Idaho, and expand cooperation among education partners and minimize conflicts. 
 Idaho has no public medical school in its borders; this is how its doctors are trained. 

Working group members on Monday got a detailed lay of the land when it comes to training future Idaho doctors. 
Without a public medical school in Idaho, the state supports 40 seats at the UW medical school through WWAMI and 10 seats at the University of Utah’s medical school. 
WWAMI students spend their first two years of classroom education at the University of Idaho’s Moscow campus, during which the state’s funding for those students goes to the U of I. The students then spend their next two years doing clinical rotations, which could take place in any of the program’s partner states, and at which point Idaho’s state support goes to the UW. The state pays on average $44,000 per student, which does not support tuition but supports the students’ education and reserves their seat, said Rayme Geidl, interim co-director of the U of I School of Health and Medical Professions and interim regional dean of Idaho WWAMI medical education. 
Idaho’s 10 students who train in Utah spend their first year of classroom education at the campus in Salt Lake City, and their second year doing a new process of “longitudinal integrated clerkships,” in which students may rotate specialties daily. During years three and four, students may focus on a specialty, and at this point Idaho students return to the Gem State for their primary care rotation, according to Ben Chan, associate dean of admissions and associate dean of Idaho affairs at the University of Utah. 
Idaho State University has a number of health education programs, including nursing, dental hygiene, counseling and graduate programs in pharmacy, dentistry, and a family medicine residency, said Rex Force, ISU vice president for health sciences. 
The panel also heard from the state’s private, for-profit institution, the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine, or ICOM, which has been running since 2018. 
This year, 37 students of the class of 225 students were from Idaho, said Kevin Wilson, dean and chief academic officer at ICOM. 
So far, all of the Idaho students who’ve trained at the school have chosen to remain in Idaho for clinical rotations at its core core sites in the Treasure Valley, Magic Valley and in eastern Idaho, Wilson said.

 Clinical sites are a challenge to expanding undergraduate medical education in Idaho 

During med school, students are required to spend time doing clinical rotations, in which they work in health care settings and receive training from practitioners. The providers who oversee their clinical training are known as preceptors, and those who spoke Monday indicated it is hard to find enough of them in Idaho. 
This issue also came up frequently during the 2025 legislative session when Manwaring questioned WWAMI representatives as to why the program hadn’t yet expanded seats for Idaho students.  
Multiple presenters indicated a number factors that drive this shortage including the fact that the state has lost several OB-GYNs and thus preceptors in that field are limited and there is a competition among health care programs that makes it more difficult to place students. 
Doctors left Idaho after abortion ban, study confirms

More than 40% of Idaho’s practicing obstetricians have left the state since the state’s near-total felony abortion ban took effect, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Force, with ISU, said that the school has to place physician assistant and nurse practitioner students and so do other programs such as Lewis Clark State College and community colleges. 
“It’s a very crowded, competitive learning environment,” Force said. 
Speakers also said that taking on a medical student can mean a doctor has to see fewer patients, which can impact a clinic’s income. Some programs pay preceptors for the students they see, and others, such as ISU, do not. 
This can create a challenge, said work force member Dr. Ted Epperly, graduate medical education coordinator for the state of Idaho and CEO of Full Circle Health. 
 Public comment centers on supporting WWAMI 

Five physicians spoke during the public comment portion of Monday’s meeting, and all of them were connected to WWAMI in some way and all of them had a similar message: keep WWAMI in place while exploring outside options.

All of the speakers said they supported the mission of the working group, but asked that they maintain Idaho’s partnership with UW, which they noted, is consistently top-ranked among medical schools in the nation. 
“Because Idaho WWAMI is a public entity, it prioritizes Idahoans’ needs and not profits, not anything else,” said Joey Florence, a doctor at Full Circle Health.
Working group co-Chair Sen. Dave Lent, R-Idaho Falls, said he appreciates what WWAMI has done over the years, but more needed to be done. 
“We love it,” he said. “We love you participating in this. But the state’s growing, and we have to look to the future.” 
The working group plans to meet again Aug. 26.

Fifty four people applied for the top job at the Trust, with Adams advancing to the final round with one other applicant, the Trust announced by press release. The job paid $120,852-a-year as of 2023.
Adams holds a Bachelor of Science degree in fisheries and wildlife with an emphasis on conservation biology.
In a statement, Adams pledged to lead the Trust “with transparency and a renewed commitment to public engagement, while adhering to NET’s updated laws, policies and procedures.”
The Environmental Trust was created along with the Nebraska Lottery, which provides about $20 million a year for the Trust to distribute in competitive grants aimed at “conserving, enhancing and restoring Nebraska’s natural environments.”
In recent years, applications for grants have declined substantially, with some previous recipients declining to seek additional grants due to new requirements that have increased the number of applications deemed “ineligible.”
In addition, Gov. Jim Pillen and state lawmakers carved out about $13 million from the Trust’s annual lottery allotment next year to help close the state’s budget deficit — a move that prompted the threat of a lawsuit.
In a statement, Adams said she would work to “rebuild trust and increase (the) impact” of the Trust “by maintaining open communication and consistency with our grantees.”
Sandy Scofield, president of the group Friends of the Environmental Trust, said Monday she wasn’t surprised by the selection of Adams.
“We’ve always worked well with her,” said Scofield, a former state senator. “She certainly has the experience to run the grant program.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Baltimore Gas & Electric briefly urged customers to conserve electricity Monday afternoon after an transmission facility failure forced a Maryland power plant offline, which could have caused “possible widespread outages.”
By Monday evening, the utility said it believed the problem was solved and the threat had passed. But that came after several hours in which BGE,  in a news release, asked its customers to take steps such as turning off nonessential appliances and using less air conditioning, including by closing their blinds and turning on ceiling fans. It also urged ratepayers to set aside supplies of food and water, and charge critical electronic devices in case of an outage.
“We are asking all BGE customers to conserve electricity beginning immediately and through this evening. Energy conservation helps reduce the potential for an outage,” read the news release. “If an outage becomes necessary, we will make every effort to alert customers in advance.”
A BGE transmission facility that serves the Brandon Shores coal-fired power plant in Anne Arundel County failed at about 3 a.m. Monday, according to a spokesperson for Talen Energy, which owns the plant. By Monday afternoon, “electricity demand briefly exceeded the current capacity of the local transmission system,” according to PJM Interconnection which runs the utility grid serving Maryland.
At 3:52 p.m., PJM directed BGE to lower flows across overloaded lines, resulting in “limited outages” to customers, wrote PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields. That directive was canceled by 4:20 p.m, after BGE restored parts of the transmission system.
“We expect that BGE will soon be returning to service those customers who were shed as part of our original directive,” Shields wrote. “Continued reliable operation of the local transmission system will depend upon the operability of the transmission facilities that tripped this morning, but for now, the system is in a place such that we can serve our peak evening demand in the area.”

The Brandon Shores plant was scheduled to shut down in May, along with Talen’s nearby oil-burning H.A. Wagner plant. But amid rising demand for power, regulators compelled the facilities to stay open through May 2029 using a “reliability must-run” agreement. Ratepayers are footing the $180 million annual bill.
The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel has argued that  ratepayers are essentially paying twice for the “must run” agreement, since the two plants were excluded from a key energy auction held in 2024, raising prices considerably. The People’s Counsel is pushing federal regulators to return $5 billion in auction proceeds to customers as a result.
When the transmission failure occurred Monday morning, Brandon Shores’ Unit 1 and Unit 2 facilities were both operating, but “tripped offline” because of the infrastructure failure, wrote Taryne Williams, a spokesperson for Talen Energy, in a statement.
The first of those units cannot contribute power to the grid until BGE repairs the infrastructure, Williams wrote. As of Monday afternoon, though, the second unit was “available for power generation upon completion of the start-up process.” The same was true for the nearby H.A. Wagner plant, which is served by the same transmission infrastructure, Williams said.
Asked about the outage during a news conference Monday, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City) was quick to say that the infrastructure issue impacting Brandon Shores was distinct from the energy supply constraints that were discussed in the legislature earlier this year.
“This is not a matter of there being a lack of supply in the marketplace right now, which is something that we have been talking about the potential of in several years,” Ferguson said. “This is — as you would expect in the case of a thunderstorm or lightning storm — when a pole goes down and the transmission has to be rerouted. That’s what we’re seeing here, except in this case, it was a substation that was taking in electricity and distributing it across the grid from a pretty major transmission station.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HEADSHOT-141-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 20:57:00.202826

As property owners across Sussex County begin receiving their 2026 tax bills, officials have unveiled a new online tool to help residents understand how those bills are calculated—especially following the county’s long-awaited property reassessment.
The updated tax calculator, now live on the county’s website, provides parcel-specific estimates using real assessment data and finalized tax rates.
It replaces an earlier version that relied on projections, offering users a more accurate breakdown of what they owe and why.
READ: Saint Mark’s names Aine Lafferty Bruhl as Director of Visual and Performing Arts
The reassessment, the first in decades, has led to changes in many property valuations, which could mean increases—or decreases—in tax bills.
County Finance Director Gina A. Jennings said the new tool aims to bring clarity and transparency to the process.
“There are multiple reasons beyond just the assessment that could change bills, so we wanted to create a calculator that showed the difference between tax bills last year versus this year,” Jennings said. “In the interest of transparency, and to help the public understand what’s changed, we believe the new calculator will be a handy tool in providing a side-by-side comparison of the two different tax years.”
The calculator is available here.

Blake Tillery and family at the state Capitol announcing his candidacy for lieutenant governor. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderVidalia Republican state Sen. Blake Tillery has joined the race to become Georgia’s next lieutenant governor in 2026.
The second-highest executive office in the state will be open next year because Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is running for governor.
Tillery, who was first elected to his south Georgia district in 2016, launched his campaign Monday with a fly-around with stops including Savannah, Augusta, Columbus and Perry.
During a stop at the state Capitol in Atlanta, Tillery said that he will prioritize conservative values.
“I believe that we should continue to focus on items that matter to Georgians, and I want my kids to be raised in a Georgia just like I was, one that believes in faith in God and puts Georgia values first, the same Georgia values and faith in God that were instilled in me by my parents,” he said.
During this year’s session, Tillery authored a series of red-meat conservative bills, including penalizing so-called sanctuary cities, banning transgender state workers from receiving gender-affirming care through the state health plan and preventing banks from punishing conservatives because of their beliefs. None of these bills passed into law, but they remain in play for when lawmakers reconvene in January.
Tillery, who chairs the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee that is responsible for helping shape the state’s budget, also pledged to eliminate the state income tax if elected lieutenant governor.
The lieutenant governor’s chief duty is to preside over the state Senate, and three other state senators have announced they will also campaign for the role.
Sandy Springs Democratic Sen. Josh McLaurin is so far the only declared candidate from his party.
“Blake is a mostly soft-spoken guy who may have trouble banking far enough right to outdo his primary opponents,” McLaurin said in a text. “But you can bank on him trying.”
If Tillery hopes to face the Democratic nominee next November, he’ll first have to succeed in the GOP primary in May. And two other powerful Republican senators also have their eyes set on Georgia’s lieutenant governor’s perch: Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch of Dahlonega and Senate President Pro Tem John Kennedy of Macon.
In a statement following Tillery’s announcement, Kennedy characterized himself as the candidate focused on results.
“As a lifelong Georgian from Adrian, I was raised on small town values and understand the importance of leadership focused on conservative results, not rhetoric. For the past ten years, I’ve been fighting for Georgia families and delivering real results under the Gold Dome,” Kennedy said
Speaking with reporters after his Atlanta appearance, Tillery said he, Kennedy and Gooch are largely aligned on policy, but he characterized himself as a leader.
“When we went to make sure that the state was not paying for transgender surgeries, I was carrying that. And we went to make sure that we weren’t funding woke ideologies in the budget, I was carrying that. So I appreciate their support. They’ve carried things too that I’ve supported,” Tillery said.
A House lawmaker, Buford Republican David Clark, has also filed paperwork to run for the post.

In October 2024, the company announced a $100 million investment to add 175 jobs to its plant on the Arkansas River and increase the variety of its pipe production, according to the Arkansas Economic Development Commission.
Mathur said the new facility will be up and running by this time next year, and he called the project “one of the most unique facilities in the country.”
“Under one roof, we will be covering just about every single diameter of pipe that is going to be used,” Mathur said. “It is a one-stop solution.”
Welspun’s products primarily serve the energy industry, including oil, gas and data centers. The company is headquartered in India and is part Welspun World, an international conglomerate. Welspun Corp. expanded into plastics and building materials in 2023, according to its website. 
The pipe maker has a corporate office in Houston, but Little Rock is where Welspun has put its “maximum investment” globally, Mathur said.
At a press conference in Sanders’ Capitol conference room, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. and Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde both praised Welspun’s decision to expand, calling it a good sign for Little Rock and Pulaski County’s economy.
“Today is an example of strategic recruitment of a bold company, the ability for the community to retain said company, and now continuous expansion,” Scott said. “That expansion is because of our teamwork, state, local and community, to ensure that we not only have the workers but that we provide exceptional customer service to business owners.”
Sanders called Arkansas “the most hospitable state” for business growth, touting her trade mission to Israel and the United Arab Emirates last week. The trip focused on business relationships between Arkansas and Middle Eastern companies, particularly in the defense and aerospace industries. Sanders signed a nonbinding economic development agreement with Israel’s National Technological Innovation Authority last week.
Arkansas lawmakers approve legislation aimed at mitigating energy bill spikes

Arkansas Secretary of Commerce Hugh McDonald said Monday that what draws businesses to the state includes “great workforce development efforts,” “common-sense public policy” and lower taxes than other states, McDonald said.
Arkansas lawmakers and Sanders have lowered income taxes three times since April 2023.
Sanders also touted a streamlined “regulatory timeline for new energy assets” at Monday’s press conference. The Arkansas Public Service Commission must approve a strategic energy investment within six months of application, according to the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025. The approval process previously had been 12 to 18 months.

He says the reservoir has met flood management expectations, but future releases should be reduced to protect the investment. (AJ Dome for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The 186 residents of Pawnee Rock want clean water to flow from kitchen faucets, but uranium contamination forced one city well to be taken offline and meant the western Kansas community was down to a single well.
“No redundancy,” said Katie Miller, director of water resources with Kansas Municipal Utilities, an association working on behalf of more than 200 communities. “No backup.”
She told members of the Kansas Water Program Task Force on Monday the solution in Pawnee Rock was to earmark $4.1 million for a new source of water that hopefully would be adequate in supply and quality.
Uranium may be a surprising impediment to operation of a healthy water system, but consequences of Kansas’ overreliance on irrigation for crops, and pollution of surface and groundwater with nitrates prominent in agricultural runoff, made it difficult to guarantee a lasting supply for the 3 million residents of Kansas.
“Nitrates are impacting so many of our utilities,” said Miller, who argued solutions had to be found. “We don’t have a choice from a public health standpoint.”
Cities, counties, the state and a Kansas network of groundwater districts struggle with issues of supply and demand, economic and legal complexities, workforce development, shifting government regulation and unpredictable costs of infrastructure projects while attempting to shape current practices to solidify the water future of Kansas.
The cost of water treatment plants or pipeline projects could easily double or triple in the time required to move from planning to operation.
In the city of Anthony in Harper County, there’s trouble with the $6 million water plant and nine-mile waterline connecting fresh water to 2,000 residents. The project completed in 2016 with a U.S. Department of Agriculture loan became controversial when the pipeline began experiencing frequent cracks running down the spine of piping. Repairs of the fractures cost $275,000 to $350,000 annually, so Miller said the logical remedy was to replace the defective pipe.
She said the problem with installing a new waterline was the estimated cost of $22 million to $32 million.
“We’re looking at a massive waterline project,” Miller said.

Like gold
Harold Nolte, president of Dodge City Community College, set the table for Miller’s assessment and the task force’s broader conversation about the future of water.
“Water is like gold,” Nolte said. “It’s very valuable.”
The task force learned Kansas’ groundwater management districts have been instructed to identify problems and solutions to regional water issues by a July 2026 deadline established in state law.
Orrin Feril, who represents Big Bend Groundwater Management District No. 5, said the district struggled more with water quality than water quantity. The region of Rattlesnake Creek, which is a tributary to the Arkansas River in central Kansas, had resisted attempts to reverse impairments recognized more than a decade ago, he said.
“We’ve tried many different plans. Some successful, some not. Mostly in the latter category,” Feril said. “What we’re dealing with are activities that happened in the past that have impacted the groundwater.”
Rep. Lindsay Vaughn, an Overland Park Democrat serving on the task force, suggested farmers, ranchers and other consumers ought to aggressively pursue water conservation as a self-preservation strategy. She recommended offering incentives to reduce field applications that contributed to nitrate runoff harmful to water resources.
The idea of the Legislature directing groundwater district boards to track application of nitrates may be worthy of consideration, said Sen. Kenny Titus, R-Manhattan.
“Do you think we should be looking at requiring groundwater management districts to more actively manage nitrates and farming practices?” Titus asked Feril.
Historically, Kansas officials have leaned into collaborative reform rather than mandated change to extend life of the Ogallala Aquifer, support dwindling streams and creeks or protect government investments in reservoirs.
“I don’t know how to answer that question,” Feril said. “We have regulatory authority to impose requirements for sampling. The board at this point has taken a different track. They said, ‘Let’s not take that heavy-handed approach. Let’s do it in a voluntary method.’ ”
Jason Norquest, assistant general manager of the Groundwater Management District No. 3, said part of his quest was to develop support from heavy water users for new strategies for extending the life of water resources. In some areas aquifer consumption should fall by as much as 25% over the next couple decades, he said.
Economic consequences of moving closer to a sustainable supply, or better matching the volume of water going in and coming out of the ground, cannot be dismissed by politicians or regulators, he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7720-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 19:56:59.521223

Elijah Nouvelage/Getty ImagesU.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta Monday in the wake of a deadly shooting near the agency’s Roybal Campus that left both the suspected gunman and a police officer dead.
Police said the suspect opened fire shortly before 5 p.m. Friday from across the street at Emory Point, a mixed-use development near Emory University and the CDC. Bullet damage was seen in the walls and windows of at least four buildings on the CDC campus. And the Associated Press reported Monday that the gunman fired more than 180 shots into the campus and broke about 150 windows. 
The shooting suspect has been identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White of Kennesaw, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Police say he was found dead with gunshot wounds on the second floor of a CVS at Emory Point, but have not released further details about possible motives for the shooting. Reporting from the New York Times and CNN allege that the shooter blamed his health issues on the COVID-19 vaccine.

Kennedy — who has repeatedly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines and promoted widely debunked claims about vaccine harm — toured the campus alongside Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O’Neill and CDC Director Susan Monarez.
“We know how shaken our public health colleagues feel today,” Kennedy said in a statement posted to X the morning after the shooting. “No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.”
“We are actively supporting CDC staff on the ground and across the agency,” he added. “Public health workers show up every day with purpose — even in moments of grief and uncertainty.”
But some public health workers and advocates have bristled at Kennedy’s statement, arguing that the secretary has fueled public mistrust of vaccines and public health workers, placing CDC employees in greater danger.
Fired But Fighting, a coalition of former U.S. Department of Health Human Services workers and supporters, called for Kennedy to resign from his role as health secretary.
“​​Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,” the group said in a statement. “The ongoing destruction of our public health infrastructure has destroyed the systems meant to prevent tragedies like this from happening. Cuts to CDC’s injury prevention center, including programs to reduce gun violence and support mental health, have put our country at greater risk.”
  U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff said he was grateful that the committee worked on a bipartisan basis to reject major Trump cuts for the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file photo)
Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who voted against Kennedy’s confirmation as health secretary, also criticized the Trump administration’s cuts to the agency. 
“The CDC has been under sustained political attack since this administration took power,” Ossoff said. “This is the world’s preeminent epidemiological agency responsible for protecting the American people and the world from deadly disease outbreaks, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services is a notorious crank who has embraced, over the course of his career, countless unfounded conspiracy theories about public health.”

Doug LaMalfa largely defended his vote for Trump’s megabill while fielding expletive-laden questions and comments from a hostile crowd.","In summary
At his first in-person town hall since Trump’s megabill became law, Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa largely defended his vote for Trump’s megabill while fielding expletive-laden questions and comments from a hostile crowd.


Rep. Doug LaMalfa, the Republican who represents much of California’s rural north, had barely begun his prepared remarks at a town hall in Chico early Monday when a chorus of boos and jeers overpowered him. 
The raucous interjections didn’t relent for nearly 90 minutes.
The crowd of more than 650 people at the local Elks Lodge peppered him with obscenity-laden comments and slammed him for his vote for President Donald Trump’s budget bill, which cuts more than $1.1 trillion in federal spending for Medicaid, Medicare and plans under the Affordable Care Act over the next decade. The crowd excoriated LaMalfa for supporting legislation they said will “devastate” rural hospitals and hurt vulnerable people with disabilities and poor families. 
But LaMalfa claimed the legislation makes “no cuts to the people themselves” in California’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, and instead only targets “waste, fraud and abuse” – a common and misleading line that House Republicans across the country have employed to defend the legislation.
“That’s a lie!” several attendees shouted when LaMalfa trotted out this refrain, amid a chorus of boos. “Shameless!”
“Is this how you get stuff? By yelling?” LaMalfa shot back.
LaMalfa largely defended his record, and those of his party and the president, at his first in-person forum in close to eight years in Chico, a Democratic college town that is one of a few blue dots in his Republican-leaning congressional district. 
Tasked with selling constituents on the president’s new domestic policy law, which polls show is widely unpopular, congressional Republicans across the country have faced hostile crowds as they return to their home districts for the six-week August recess.
Voters in blue cities like Chico have shown up in force at GOP town halls to vent their frustration, which the Democratic Party hopes to channel into a victory at the midterm elections. One town hall in Lincoln, Nebraska played out similarly to LaMalfa’s, with constituents lined up around the block to get inside and then, once in the room, booing incessantly. 
LaMalfa’s town hall also comes as Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats charge ahead with a frenzied effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts to offset Trump’s plan to retain control of the U.S. House by squeezing more Republican seats out of red states like Texas and Florida. The proposed California maps, expected to be made public this week, could draw LaMalfa and four other Republicans into much bluer districts, according to sources who have seen the proposed districts but aren’t authorized to speak publicly. 
The spacious community room was so tightly packed that several turned around and left. Inside, two lines snaked haphazardly down both sides of the room as constituents lined up to ask questions and comment. In an effort to reduce audience outbursts, staff handed out red and green placards for attendees to signal their opinion – but it did little to quiet the crowd.

Mathew Hilliard, a youth mental health counselor and social worker from Mount Shasta, drove more than 2.5 hours and waited outside for another hour to be the first in line to question LaMalfa about his support for the megabill. He told the congressman he was very concerned that defunding Medi-Cal could force rural hospitals in Siskiyou County and across the district to close.
“These facilities are vital to our disabled and our working-class people,” Hilliard said. “How could you support a bill that is going to devastate our already fragile infrastructure?”
LaMalfa, from his perch atop a barstool onstage, responded with the misleading Republican claim that the legislation will instead cut people who he believes should be ineligible for the program, such as people living illegally in the country and able-bodied working adults with no dependents. 
“Ask Gavin Newsom why he wants $12.5 billion to go to people that aren’t even citizens of our state, thereby hurting the Medi-Cal program,” he said.
Newsom expanded Medi-Cal enrollment to people in the country without legal status, but was forced to rein that in this year amid a forecast budget deficit. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Trump’s legislation will cause more than 10 million people to lose health insurance coverage by 2034, including more than 3.4 million Californians.
While health care dominated the boisterous forum, other questions ranged from Congress’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files to the Israel-Gaza war, and multiple commenters lamented White House overreach as Trump pushes the boundaries of executive power. Several people accused LaMalfa of aiding a descent into fascism and unleashed their fury over immigration agents rounding up U.S. citizens and legal residents in indiscriminate raids. 
LaMalfa later agreed that immigration officers “shouldn’t be capturing people that are U.S. citizens,” and he said he would support a pathway to legal status for undocumented workers in crucial industries like farming and services. But he then contradicted himself and said the fear of wrongfully detaining a citizen or legal resident shouldn’t deter officials from casting a wide net, as they have in recent raids at Home Depot parking lots in Sacramento and Los Angeles, and sorting out the wrongfully detained people later.
The in-person, open mic town hall has gradually become a relic in the age of social media, as fewer elected officials are willing to prostrate themselves in today’s hyperpartisan era. House Republicans even discouraged their members from hosting face-to-face forums after a wave of negative headlines out of viral town hall confrontations – including with their own GOP supporters – earlier this year.

LaMalfa’s staff reminded the audience they could get through more questions and comments if they quit interrupting. But there was little appetite for civil discourse, even after several speakers implored their fellow attendees to pipe down.
Ryan Rogoski, a Navy veteran from Chico, told LaMalfa that due to lack of mental health providers in the area, he has to drive three hours round-trip to San Rafael to see a therapist for PTSD, which the congressman admitted was “crazy” and unacceptable. But when Rogoski begged LaMalfa to do something about the provider shortage, LaMalfa blamed it on “a few bad apples” in leadership at the local Chico VA who he said mismanaged existing funds. 
“You’re giving the Pentagon so much money!” Rogoski yelled before storming out of the building in tears. He later told CalMatters that LaMalfa’s answer was “extremely false,” using an expletive to emphasize his frustration. 
“It has nothing to do with taking care of veterans and our unique challenges,” Rogoski said.
Several constituents implored LaMalfa to denounce all the redistricting efforts this year as has fellow California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who recently introduced a bill to ban mid-decade redistricting. 
But LaMalfa said California’s effort was especially reprehensible since voters established an independent redistricting commission nearly 20 years ago. 
“Maybe the people in Texas, maybe the people in other states will put their own commissions in place in order to have it be independent,” LaMalfa said in an interview. “It’s really ugly,” he added. “It doesn’t give you more faith in the political process.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081124_LaMalfa-TownHall_SO_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 19:56:59.521223

The New Mexico Environment Department and the New Mexico Department of Health will host a free domestic well water testing event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday in the Home and Arts Building at 1900 E. Brady Ave in Clovis.
The departments’ event, which they call a “water fair,” coincides with the Curry County Fair. It offers the first 100 well owners who show up the chance to measure pH, specific conductance and levels of nitrates in their water, which the agencies said in a news release are crucial measurements for maintaining safe drinking water.
“Private well owners in Curry County can come to this water fair and find out more about the quality of their household drinking water,” Ground Water Quality Bureau Chief Justin Ball said in a statement. “Free well water testing gives families the knowledge they need to make informed choices about their water and health.”
This fall, the environment department will also hold water fairs in Española, Farmington and Las Cruces, Ground Water Quality Bureau Pollution Prevention Program Manager Jason Herman told Source NM in a statement on Monday. Those events will appear on the agency’s events calendar at least one month in advance, he said.
Since July 2024, the environment department has tested 231 private drinking water wells at seven water fairs, the agency said in a news release.
Department staff try to hold eight water fairs in communities across the state in the spring and fall, Herman said, and they select locations based on inquiries from the public, community need and how long it’s been since the last water fair in the area. The program reaches an area every two to three years because New Mexico is such a large state, he said.
State officials are asking participants to bring a sample of their well water in a container, along with information about their well including overall well depth, depth to water, well casing material, well latitude and longitude and distance between the well and the nearest septic tank or leach field system. Guidelines about how to properly collect a sample can be found on the environment department’s site.
Well owners, their family members or neighbors should bring their water sample to the event for it to be tested. If the owner themselves cannot bring the sample, the container must be clearly labeled with the owner’s name, phone number, address and well information.
Herman said the environment department is equipping all its field offices around the state to do private well water testing, and they anticipate having the service ready by mid-September.

Larry Rhoden, whose Monday announcement said the subject is not a U.S. citizen and is “now in immigration proceedings.”
The estimated street value of the drugs is $12 million, the news release said.
Rhoden used the arrest as an opportunity to tout his Operation Prairie Thunder, which commits state government personnel and resources to assist with the activities of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“We are taking action to protect the people of South Dakota from criminals and drug traffickers,” Rhoden said in the release.
His office said the suspect is the eighth person who isn’t a citizen stopped by the Highway Patrol since it signed an agreement to assist ICE earlier this year amid an immigration crackdown by the Trump administration. The state’s Department of Corrections and the Division of Criminal Investigation have also signed agreements with the federal agency.
The type of agreement that the Highway Patrol has with ICE was discontinued during the Obama and Biden administrations, due to concerns about racial profiling. 
The suspect in the meth seizure case is a 42-year-old man who was allegedly stopped for speeding on Interstate 90 in Sturgis. A service dog detected an odor that led to the discovery of the drugs, according to the news release from Rhoden’s office.
Although the release related those and other details of the arrest and said the suspect is charged with three crimes, it did not include his name, making it difficult for South Dakota Searchlight to immediately find court documents related to the case. Department of Public Safety spokesman Brad Reiners declined to provide the name.
“I am unable to release any details on the individual as this is still an active investigation,” Reiners wrote in an email.
The news release said other agencies assisting in the investigation include the Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Meade County Sheriff’s Office and Rapid City Police Department.

Greg Gianforte announces his 406 JOBS Initiative at Boeing’s Helena facility on Aug. 11, 2025. (Courtesy photo)Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Monday a new statewide initiative to bolster workforce development in skilled trades and AI usage. 
Gianforte signed Executive Order 5-2025 creating the 406 JOBS Initiative, which directs the Department of Labor and Industry’s State Workforce Innovation Board to put Montana in line with national education and workforce development goals set by President Donald Trump. 
“406 JOBS stands for four pathways to employment, zero barriers to work, and six high-demand sectors,” Gianforte said during a press conference held at Helena’s Boeing manufacturing center on Monday. “Those sectors include health care, construction, hospitality and recreation, advanced manufacturing and computing education and child care and financial and professional services. 
Earlier this year, Trump signed two executive orders directing federal agencies to implement workforce development initiatives focused on training for skilled trade jobs and advancing artificial intelligence in education.  
Within the state, Gianforte’s executive order establishes the State Workforce Innovation Board as the lead coordinating body for 406 JOBS. According to the order, the board will develop and oversee the implementation of the JOBS initiative, “facilitate industry-led workforce strategies that reflect current and future labor market demands, and consult with tribal governments, tribal colleges, and Native-led organizations in the design and implementation of strategies that reflect the needs of tribal communities.”
“Under this plan, we will ensure that our workforce system values all the ways that people enter and move around our labor market — apprenticeships, industry-recognized credentials, Sprint degrees, military service, entrepreneurship and traditional college degree programs,” DLI Commissioner Sarah Swanson said during the press conference. “406 JOBS will focus us on a statewide level, on those things that are keeping people from attaining work.”
According to a DLI report released last week analyzing the roughly 340,000 Montanans who are not actively participating in the labor force, more than 100,000 working-age Montanans are not employed, and not seeking work. 
Citing that data, Swanson said some of those people are “making the choice to be stay at home parents or to retire early, and when family finances allow for that, we celebrate those choices.” But she said others are prevented from participating in the workforce due to serious systemic or lifestyle barriers. 
Those barriers can include a lack of access to child care, chronic illness or disability, criminal justice history, or even challenges transitioning from military to civilian service,” Swanson said.“We need to build some bridges back to work especially in these high demand sectors,” Swanson said.
Jason Yager, a State Workforce and Innovation Board Member and Executive Director of the Montana Photonics & Quantum Alliance, also spoke at the governor’s press conference about the importance of developing a stronger pipeline for workers seeking to enter the labor market in manufacturing and computing fields. 
“I can tell you firsthand that Montana’s opportunities in advanced manufacturing, information technology and computing are enormous,” Yager said. “Companies from all over the world are looking to come to Montana, and they need a skilled, prepared workforce.”
Over the next few weeks, DLI staff and members of the State Workforce Innovation Board will be traveling the state to share more details and goals of the 406 JOBS initiative, and will “seek input from Montana citizens, members of the Montana Legislature, Montana associations whose members are impacted by workforce development challenges, and other appropriate stakeholders,” according to the order. 
“You’ll hear us talking more about industry recognized credentials, apprenticeships, opportunities for young people and more access to training programs in our rural communities,” Yager said.
Gianforte’s executive order also directs DLI to expand the training and use of AI in schools and job fields. 
The initiative directs the Department of Labor to:

promote and expand opportunities that equip Montanans with AI skills
provide professional development opportunities that support educators in incorporating AI-skills development into career awareness and readiness instruction
identify opportunities to integrate AI tools that assist job seekers in navigating career pathways, accessing training, and securing employment
encourage public-private partnerships that accelerate AI workforce development and adoption across key sectors
support small businesses in upskilling workers and incorporating AI technologies into business operations
prioritize digital modernization, including AI-readiness, in workforce service delivery and talent development programs.  

DLI is directed to work with the Office of Public Instruction, the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, the Montana University System, and the Department of Commerce for its AI initiatives. 
Through his executive orders, Trump directed some federal funding to states that implement programs like the one announced by Gianforte, which Swanson said the state would seek. 
DLI will be “maximizing the workforce investments that are already in existence in Montana, focusing on letting the private sector and the employers lead and going where they’d like us to follow,” Swanson said. “This is a reorganization of existing agency workforce programs across all of the state agencies that the governor leads.”
Per the executive order, SWIB is expected to deliver an implementation plan within 90 days to examine existing agency workforce initiatives and establish annual reporting mechanisms.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/406-JOBS.png,,,2025-08-11 18:56:47.945606

Terry Lutz, who chaired a work group within the Iowa DOGE task force, said at a meeting Wednesday that one of the recommendations under consideration was “doing away with the current defined benefits program and going to a defined contribution program” for public employees. This change was recommended because compensation packages for government workers through IPERS, the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System, are “way out of whack” with private sector compensation, he said.
The proposal on IPERS and other benefits would apply to new employees, while the compensation would remain the same as it currently exists for current employees, Lutz said. Gov. Kim Reynolds created the task force, modeled after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) program in the Trump administration, to seek government cost-cutting and efficiency measures at the state and local levels.

This proposal has sparked significant backlash from public worker groups and others, who have rallied using the slogan “Hands off IPERS” while urging supporters to contact Reynolds and lawmakers to voice their opposition to the recommendation.
Since the DOGE task force meeting, several Republican lawmakers have made posts on social media stating it is unlikely the Republican trifecta will pursue changes to the public retirement system in the upcoming legislative session.
Rep. Steve Holt, R-Denison, wrote in a Facebook post Saturday Republicans are committed to finding “innovative ways to make government smaller and smarter” — but this work will likely not involve modifying IPERS.
“I have discussed this issue with the House Speaker and other legislators,” Holt wrote. “While I recognize concerns about IPERS, I want to reassure Iowans that there is virtually no interest in making changes to it. We have one of the best funded retirement systems in the country.”
A handful of other House Republicans, including Reps. Tom Jeneary of Le Mars, Jason Gearhart of Strawberry Point and Mark Thompson of Clarion, made social media posts, saying they had received questions about the task force’s IPERS recommendation and wanted to reassure constituents the Legislature was unlikely to take up the issue.
Though several Republicans have voiced opposition to the proposal, several Democrats have called for Iowans who oppose the cuts to speak out in support of government employees. Rep. Molly Buck, D-Ankeny, wrote on Thursday this means contacting lawmakers and joining advocacy groups, as well as voting “for candidates who will protect retirement security.”
Iowa Auditor Rob Sand, who is running as a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, criticized the proposal in a statement, saying the best way to make government more efficient was to “restore the State Auditor’s power to find misspent money,” not make changes to IPERS.
“Police officers, firefighters, teachers, plow drivers, and more paid into IPERS and should be thanked for their service,” Sand said. “They take salaries lower than typical private sector salaries, some because of the promise of IPERS. This proposal could result in reductions of retirement benefits that these workers have already paid into for years. Weakening IPERS will stop many people from taking public service jobs, leaving the public worse off and more key roles unfilled.”
Sen. David Sires of Cedar Falls wrote on Saturday there was “misinformation” being spread about changes to IPERS by Democrats. The recommendation — which would have to be approved by the legislature — would only impact new employees, and “there is very little interest in the legislature to take up this idea at all.”
“Claims that Republicans are attempting to ‘gut IPERS’ are simply false,” Sires wrote. “IPERS remains strong and will continue to serve the thousands of Iowans who depend on it.”
Though the recommendation was discussed in a public meeting earlier in August, the DOGE task force has not officially recommended changes to IPERS to Reynolds and lawmakers yet. The task force is scheduled to meet again on Sept. 24 before submitting its final report.

Vermont State Police have taken over from the Northfield Police Department the investigation into the death of a 68-year-old man, later ruled a suicide, that the man’s daughter believes was suspicious.
For the past several months, Alexandria Stanley has been pushing for a law enforcement agency outside of Northfield police to conduct an independent investigation into the death of her father, Pedro “Pete” Baez. 
She has disputed the findings by the police and the Vermont’s Chief Medical Examiner’s Office that her father died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2024 at his home in Northfield.
Stanley said Monday that she was heartened by the news that state police would be taking over the investigation. 
“I’m hugely thankful that this will be looked at anew,” Stanley said. “I’ve been asking for an unbiased, independent investigation into my father’s suspicious death since November.” 
A detective from the state police major crime unit has been assigned to conduct an external review of the Pedro Baez death investigation carried out by the Northfield Police Department, according to an email that State Police Detective Lt. Tyson Kinney wrote to attorney Christina Nolan, who represents Stanley, on Friday
On Monday afternoon, state police announced they had “assumed the lead role in 
investigating” Baez’s death. 
Detectives from the state police major crime unit will work with the Washington County State’s Attorney’s Office, the Vermont Chief Medical Examiner’s Office, and the Northfield Police Department, “which initially was the primary investigative agency” on the case, according to a statement from state police. 
“Members of the state police will interview witnesses, gather facts and review evidence before presenting a complete investigative file to the state’s attorney for review,” the statement added. “The State’s Attorney’s Office will make a final determination on whether to file charges.”
State police did not respond to a question from VTDigger about what prompted its action. State police had previously declined attempts by Stanley seeking to have them take a lead role in the investigation.
“VSP is unable to comment further on this investigation while it is open and active,” the statement Monday from state police read.
Northfield Police Chief Pierre Gomez could not be reached Monday for comment. 
Michelle Donnelly, Washington County’s state’s attorney, said Monday that she would work with the state police as the investigation progresses.
The move by state police comes days after Peter Baez, 41, of Northfield, who is Stanley’s brother and Pedro Baez’s son, was arraigned Thursday in U.S. District Court in Burlington on federal charges of possessing and stealing guns from his late father’s estate about a month after his father’s death.
Peter Baez pleaded not guilty to the two criminal charges and was released on conditions. 
At that hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Arra said that shortly before his death, Baez had removed his son from the will and made Stanley the beneficiary.
Attorney William A. Vasiliou II, representing Baez, said after the hearing that his client “had nothing to do with the death of his father.”
Vasiliou could not be reached for further comment Monday afternoon.
Nolan, Vermont’s former U.S. attorney who represents Stanley, had written an email in April to law enforcement officials, as well as state and local leaders, seeking further investigation into Pedro Baez’s death. Nolan cited several problems she saw in the probe that led to the suicide, including that no autopsy took place and that Northfield police relied heavily on information by Peter Baez, who was living with his father at that time.
Berlin police later conducted a review of Northfield Police Department’s death investigation. In a report in April obtained by VTDigger, the investigator from Berlin police stated there were issues that warranted further investigation.
The report found that there were “inadequate” photographs taken at the residence, particularly of the father’s deceased body. The recommendations for further investigation listed in the report included obtaining financial records from Pedro and Peter Baez, medical records for Pedro Baez, as well as contacting service providers to preserve any internet, social media and cellphone records of the parties.
The report also recommended that an interview be conducted with Pedro Baez’s neighbor about his mental state at the time leading up to his death.
Stanley said Monday that she looked forward to finding out what the state police probe reveals. 
“My father lived the last 40 years of his life in the town of Northfield,” she said. “He deserves the dignity of a competent police investigation.”

While the state has invested heavily in fiber for internet connectivity, the state's broadband office director said told a legislative committee Monday that satellite internet could be a ""significant"" part of the puzzle as it seeks 100% connectivity. (Photo courtesy Jeff Lopez's legislative presentation)Even with federal changes to a huge funding stream for New Mexico, 90% of the state has access to high-speed internet, and contracts will be in place for the last 10% by the end of next year, the new leader of a state broadband office said Monday. 
And to get over the finish line, satellite internet is a “significant part of the picture,” said Jeff Lopez, who is beginning his eighth week in charge of the New Mexico Broadband Access and Expansion Office. Lopez was speaking to state lawmakers on the interim Economic and Rural Development committee. 
“We are still ‘fiber first,” Lopez said. “We’re focusing on areas that are financially prudent for that fiber connectivity, but low-Earth orbit satellites are going to be part of the picture, again, of meeting that commitment by the end of 2026.”
Roughly 90,000 New Mexico locations are “unserved” or “underserved” in terms of broadband access, according to Lopez’s presentation. “Unserved” households have download speeds of less than 25 megabits a second, while “underserved” have download speeds between 25 megabits a second and 100 megabits a second. A household of four with a 100-megabit download speed could stream videos, work remotely and have video calls like for telemedicine, “but not necessarily all at once,” Lopez said. 
NM Legislative Recap March 4: $70M request, likely headed to Musk’s Starlink, ‘probably dead’

The extent to which New Mexico’s internet connectivity plans include satellite, has been an open question amid federal changes to an infrastructure spending bill passed during President Joe Biden’s term.
Also, during the legislative session earlier this year, as Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency was firing federal workers and dismantling  federal programs, state lawmakers removed $70 million for satellite internet in the state budget that the previous broadband director said would likely have gone directly to Musk’s company satellite internet company Starlink. That funding cut does not affect the office’s timeline. 
Satellite internet companies can provide access in rural areas and those where overlapping jurisdictions or topographical features make it difficult and expensive to bury fiber lines Lopez said. But he also said fiber is “future proof” because it’s a largely permanent installation safely underground
“We still believe that [fiber] is the best connectivity that money can buy, but it’s often much more expensive than alternatives,” he said.
Satellite, on the other hand, is not as resilient to natural disasters, he said, and the technology isn’t “fully fleshed out yet.”
New Mexico Broadband Office wants $70M for satellite, high-speed internet

“It makes sense in areas with open skies, but we also have a lot of community communities along waterways and valleys, along bosques, whether it’s tree coverage or just a mesa or a mountain in the way, that can also impede some of the access,” he said. 
Biden’s infrastructure bill created the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program to oversee billions of dollars in internet connectivity spending. The state broadband office successfully qualified for $675 million of it and, Lopez said, was in the final steps last month of awarding sub-grantees the funding. 
But in early June, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced rule changes to the program that leaders said were aimed at reducing regulatory burdens and ensuring that all broadband technologies had equal footing when competing for the funds. 
The change toward “technology neutrality” meant the removal of “previous restrictions that favored fiber deployments,” according to a news release from the broadband office in early July. In addition to giving satellite a better shot at the funding, the rule change required all potential recipients of the funding to submit a new round of applications “regardless of where the state was in its sub-grantee selection process,” according to the news release. 
Two satellite companies have put in bids for the federal broadband  funding, Lopez said Monday. He declined to name which companies are seeking the funding.
“But you might be able to guess,” Lopez told lawmakers. 
According to the state Broadband Office’s application page for the federal money, SpaceX, which provides Starlink, is one of a handful of “prequalified applicants” that provides internet access. It appears to be the only satellite internet provider on the list.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-11-at-4.25.57-PM-1024x556.png,,,2025-08-11 18:56:47.945606

Wildfires are supposed to be less common in the summer, when the state is usually lush and green, but they appear to be popping up more frequently, the state forest fire supervisor said.

Most of the state was under a “very high” fire risk warning as of Monday due to dry conditions, according to Vermont Emergency Management. 
Only the central portion of the southern end of the state, including eastern Rutland and Bennington counties, and western Windsor and Windham counties, were under a lower-level “high” risk, the department wrote in a Facebook post. It warned Vermonters to avoid open burning, exercise caution with outdoor grills, campfires and machinery, and properly extinguish cigarettes. 
Megan Davin, a spokesperson for the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, said three “very high” fire warnings had been issued so far in 2025. Meanwhile, there were 13 overall in 2024 and 13 in 2023. 
Dan Dillner, the state forest fire supervisor, said the current conditions were abnormal compared to the past 20 years. “I don’t know what normal is anymore,” he said. 
Wildfires are supposed to be less common in the summer, when the state is usually lush and green, but they appear to be popping up more frequently, he said. In July, the state spent weeks fighting an 11-acre wildfire in Fair Haven. The last time a wildfire of that size had broken out in July was in 1988.
He urged Vermonters to follow safe fire practices. Along with avoiding open burns, anyone lighting a grill or campfire should keep it away from vegetation, monitor the embers and make sure it’s always attended. People also should be careful with cigarettes and other small burning items. 
“When you get to ‘very high’ fire danger, even flicking a cigarette into brush can cause a fire,” he said. 
Forty-five wildfires have been reported in Vermont so far this year, totaling 46 acres of damage. One was attributed to a lightning strike. The rest? Human-caused. 
“We in the Northeast need to remember our Smokey the Bear,” the famous mascot for fire safety, he said.  
The alert came as the state entered a new phase of hotter temperatures in an already hotter-than-average summer. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle and western Addison counties for Monday and Tuesday. Burlington is expected to reach temperatures in the mid-90s on both days, the weather service said. 
The Vermont Department of Health maintains a list of cooling centers across the state and tips on staying safe in the heat on its website. 
Recent days have also seen less rain than expected for this time of year. Burlington has received 6 inches of rain in total since June 1, the start of meteorological summer. By contrast, the average rainfall during that time between 1990 and 2020 was over 9 inches. 
Roughly three-quarters of Vermont has been reported to have “abnormally dry” conditions by the U.S. Drought Monitor, a research project from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Less than two weeks after authorities say a state trooper killed his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend in a jealous rage, a New Jersey lawmaker is calling for passage of a bipartisan bill that would expand the definition of domestic violence to include psychological abuse.
Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris) conceded in a statement that it’s unknown if a change in the law would have saved the victims — Lauren Semanchik and Tyler Webb — but Dunn added that the Legislature is “obligated to act and act swiftly.”
“This young woman feared for her safety and the system failed her in the worst way,” Dunn said.
Authorities believe Ricardo Jorge Santos, a lieutenant with the New Jersey State Police, shot Semanchik and Webb at Semanchik’s Franklin Township home and then took his own life in Piscataway (the victims’ bodies were found Aug. 2). Semanchik’s family has said she feared for her safety after ending her relationship with Santos and tried to get Franklin police involved but officers did not help her. Last week, the Hunterdon County Prosecutor’s Office took over control of the Franklin Township Police Department, saying the murder investigation “raised serious concerns about FTPD’s operations and effectiveness.”
Dunn’s bill aims to add psychological and economic abuse to the legal definition of domestic violence. She introduced it in January 2024 with Assemblywoman Lisa Swain (D-Bergen).
“Psychological abuse isn’t currently included in the definition of domestic violence, but it can be just as damaging as any physical assault and needs to be taken just as seriously. It is often the precursor to a violent incident,” Dunn said.
The Legislature is on a summer recess and will likely not reconvene until after November’s election, when all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot.

Max Misch, a Bennington white supremacist, was sentenced Monday to two weeks in jail on charges of possessing high-capacity gun magazines. The court also made incremental progress toward his upcoming court dates involving kidnapping and assault charges.Misch’s sentencing took all of 10 minutes, with the state’s co-counsel Franklin Paulino requesting that Misch receive 14 to 15 days in jail. Misch’s lawyer, Frederick C. Bragdon did not push back, stating that he and his client agreed to the state’s terms. 
The case, which has been ongoing for roughly six years, tested a 2018 state law regulating high capacity magazines.

When Judge Jennifer Barrett gave Misch the opportunity to address the court following his sentencing, Misch appeared relatively at peace with the decision.“I think it’s a fair punishment for the crime. I think it fits the crime,” Misch said, though adding that he didn’t think his actions were a crime. “… I don’t agree with this law, but it is what it is. One day, I will be vindicated and that’s that. That’s all I have to say.”
Misch first gained state and national attention following his racial harassment of Kiah Morris, a former state representative for Bennington and the only Black woman to serve in Vermont’s House of Representatives.Barrett stated that Misch would have to be held without bail on the remaining kidnapping and assault charges until the defense had an actionable release plan. Barett also scheduled a check-in on Misch’s upcoming case for Sept. 10.

(Photo provided by Mullins McLeod)A Charleston lawyer is the first Democrat to officially launch a campaign for governor ahead of the 2026 election cycle.
Mullins McLeod, a 53-year-old attorney who was among the lawyers that helped negotiate an $88 million settlement for victims of the 2015 shooting at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, launched a bid for the Governor’s Mansion with a three-minute YouTube video Monday.
McLeod told the SC Daily Gazette, if elected, he would push back on the large incentive packages used to lure companies to the state. He did not name any specific deal he opposed.
And he joined in the chorus of Republican candidates calling for eliminating the state’s personal income tax — a major source of revenue for state spending. Income taxes are expected to provide more than $6.5 billion this fiscal year. Zeroing that out would slash 45% of the state’s general fund. At the same time, he wants to almost double teachers’ salaries.
“I believe there is a job that needs to be done and needs to be done now. That job is curing a cancer that has infiltrated our state government over the last 25 years,” McLeod said in the campaign video.
That cancer, according to McLeod, is “corruption” and state lawmakers bowing to corporations that have lobbied to “rig the system for their own financial gains.”
Though he doesn’t say it, the 25 years refers to how long Republicans have controlled both chambers in the Statehouse. After the 2000 elections, the party-switching of a single Democrat gave the GOP control of the Senate. The last Democrat in the Governor’s Mansion left office in January 2003.
In his campaign video, however, McLeod doesn’t call himself a Democrat of Republican. Nor does he mention either party.
“What I believe makes South Carolina great is the people that go to work everyday,” McLeod told the Daily Gazette. “And giving people’s hard earned tax dollars to large, for-profit corporations, that’s just disrespectful.”
“Public money should only be used for the public good,” McLeod added.
The personal injury attorney will need to overcome headlines of his arrest three months ago.
In May, McLeod was charged with disorderly conduct in downtown Charleston near the Battery, according to reporting by The Post and Courier. Officers said McLeod was wearing nothing but underwear and shoes and “yelling at the top of his lungs.” McLeod’s lawyer told a judge the erratic behavior stemmed from a mental health episode and exhaustion, the newspaper reported.
McLeod acknowledged the arrest but declined to comment Monday on the pending case, other than to say, “I was not in my underwear.”
He will explain, just not yet: “Long before voters go to the polls, they will know what happened,” he said.
A copy of the police report was not immediately available. The police department required the SC Daily Gazette to submit a request for the report under the Freedom of Information Act.
Meanwhile, Rep. Jermaine Johnson, D-Columbia, said he is still in the exploratory stage of a run for governor.
SC House Democrat says he’s exploring run for governor

“I believe South Carolina deserves leaders who are steady, consistent, and committed to the work, not just in an election year, but every single day,” Johnson said in a statement. “Until my decision is made, I’ll continue doing what I’ve always done: putting in the work for the people who sent me to Columbia and for the future of our great state.”
Johnson added that his decision on whether or not to run “will not be based on anyone else’s intention to seek the seat.”
On the Republican side, five candidates are vying for the party’s nomination.
McLeod, the nephew of former state Rep. Walt McLeod, D-Little Mountain, and the late state Sen. Peden Brown McLeod, D-Walterboro, previously ran for governor in 2010. He dropped out of that race ahead of the Democratic primary, endorsing former state Sen. Vincent Sheheen, D-Camden.
Sheheen ultimately lost the governor’s race to Nikki Haley.
Now, McLeod is back.
In addition to criticizing the state’s economic development incentives, he wants to rein in county-level property tax breaks for major manufacturers. While property tax decisions are made by local officials and do not affect the state budget, McLeod said all of it should be examined.
He also called out a portion of the massive energy package passed by the Legislature in May.
The section of the bill, known as rate stabilization, allows public utility companies to raise electric rates on an annual basis using a truncated review by state regulators rather than the full-blown rate process.
“I believe that’s corruption,” McLeod said.
McLeod, in his published platform, also said he will push for term limits, seek to make the cost of child care 100% tax deductible, and propose taxes for companies that use automation to reduce their workforce needs.
And there’s one business incentive he wants to add: He believes companies should get a tax credit for paying off their employees’ student loans.
As for teachers, he believes the state should pay them between $85,000 and $100,000.
Currently, teachers’ average salary statewide is about $62,000, though their pay depends on their years of experience and level of college degree.
That’s after legislators put $112 million into increasing teachers’ salaries this school year. That raised teachers’ minimum pay by $1,500 across the so-called salary schedule and brought the floor for first-year teachers to $48,500.
Raising that floor to $50,000 — as Gov. Henry McMaster recommended in his budget proposal — would have cost $200 million.
SC education officials ask legislators to raise teachers’ starting pay to $50K in 2025

Former state Rep. Bakari Sellers, who worked with McLeod on the Mother Emmanuel settlement, called McLeod a “forward-thinker and “one of the most accomplished trial lawyers in the state.”
The Bamberg County Democrat said McLeod will have to answer questions about the circumstances surrounding his arrest.
“It’s going to be a large hurdle,” Sellers said. “But we should try not to judge people at the moments when they are at the bottom. I’m willing to give him that grace.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mcleod_15webp.jpg,,,2025-08-11 17:57:24.627960

In the 13 months after the program expired, the Downwinder Clinic was still working with eligible families to gather the documents needed to qualify for RECA payments. And last month, after Congress reauthorized RECA in its massive spending bill, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program are again eligible for compensation.

“We have been working with families during the 13 months the program was expired to help gather the documents they would need when RECA was reinstated. Now, we want people to know that the qualifying boundaries have expanded, as well as new applicants qualify for a larger compensation amount for the health issues they have encountered,” said Barlow.
RECA has been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was impacted by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered. 
Now, the program’s scope is much broader. All of Utah is considered an affected area, meaning if you lived in the Beehive State for a period of 12 months between 1951 to 1962, and contracted a certain type of cancer, you are likely eligible for compensation. 
Eligible cancers include leukemia (but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma, lymphomas and cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gall bladder, lung, and ovarian.
New applicants will also now receive $100,000 — the prior compensation amount was $50,000. However, that increase is not retroactive, meaning downwinders who already received payments are not eligible for the new amount.

Most of that group, 7.5 million, would lose Medicaid benefits.A single section of the law creating new work requirements for Medicaid recipients would result in 5.6 million people losing access to care, the CBO said.The law also creates new work requirements for SNAP participants and mandates that at least some states pay for a portion of the benefits. States had never been required to cover any share of the cost of SNAP benefits.The changes to work requirements will result in reduced participation in the program by about 2.4 million people, the CBO said in another analysis published Monday.The changes to state cost-share in SNAP will save the federal government about $41 billion from 2026 to 2034, CBO said. The agency expects states to pick up most, $35 billion, of that spending.But the new requirements for states would still likely lead to 300,000 people fewer accessing benefits monthly. The report considered state officials would choose from policy responses including cutting benefits, reducing eligibility or leaving the program altogether in response to the new cost-share.‘Stealing from working families’In a press release, a quartet of Democratic leaders in Congress highlighted the regressive impact the CBO projected.“Prices keep rising and American families are struggling,” House Budget Committee ranking Democrat Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said. “So what are President Trump’s Republicans doing to help? They passed a law that will make things worse by stealing from working families to give billionaires a tax break.”“It is truly unfathomable that Trump and Republicans in Congress are championing a bill that gives the top 10 percent $13,600 more per year – while the least affluent 10 percent will lose $1,200 per year,” Senate Budget ranking Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon said. “This is families lose, and billionaires win.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, made similar statements in the release.",,,,2025-08-11 17:57:24.627960

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado’s four Democratic U.S. House members visited an immigration detention center in Aurora on Monday morning and said many of their questions to facility staff went unanswered, a departure from previous tours of the site.
“This has been the most difficult visit in terms of getting information, getting answers out of the facility and out of the employees and being obstructed from conducting a full oversight that I’ve had in over six years,” U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, who represents Aurora in Congress, told reporters following the visit.
“Transparency and oversight matter a lot, and we will not bow down from our constitutional obligation to do that duty,” he said.
It was the 10th time Crow has visited the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility since 2019.

Crow attempted to visit the facility in July but was denied entry, prompting a lawsuit brought by Crow, Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette and other members of Congress over a new administration policy that requires at least a week’s notice to conduct an oversight visit to Department of Homeland Security facilities.
Federal law gives members of Congress the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits of immigration detention facilities. The group of lawmakers gave the facility notice that they would visit following Crow’s unsuccessful trip last month.
“I’ve been in a lot of correctional facilities in my life, and if you have to give seven days’ notice, they clean up pretty good,” U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, said. “We were told that the people in there were told to clean up and to spiff up and to make things look good. I’d like to see what happens normally in that facility.”
Crow and DeGette, alongside Neguse and Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Jefferson County, toured the detention center but said it was on lockdown for a population count while they were inside. They said many of their questions, including about the percentage of the detained population with criminal convictions, went unanswered. They also noticed that detailed information about detainees’ legal rights were no longer displayed in spots they’d previously occupied, but the lawmakers did see posted information that “extol the values of self deportation,” according to Pettersen.
DeGette said she was able to speak with Jeanette Vizguerra, a prominent immigrant rights activist who has been detained at the facility since March and is the plaintiff in a lawsuit that challenges her detention. DeGette handed Vizguerra a physical copy of federal legislation she is running to give Vizguerra lawful residency in the country.
“She told me she is not going to stop fighting for immigrants’ rights, and so we’re going to keep up our oversight here,” DeGette said.
Another new policy implemented by DHS, DeGette said, requires a signed privacy notice before a member of Congress can meet with a detained constituent.
“It’s just another attempt to stop people from visiting their constituents,” she said.
ICE did not immediately return an email about that policy or about the Monday visit from the Democratic congressional delegation.
The Aurora facility, privately run by the GEO Group for ICE, is the only DHS immigration detention facility in Colorado. Documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union show that the federal government is eyeing at least six locations in the state for additional facilities.

Mohammed Hassan and Muhtasin Sadman were each charged with forging a signature on an absentee ballot application and forgery under Michigan’s election law, both felony offenses, as well as making a false statement in an application for an absentee ballot, a misdemeanor. 
Sadman is also facing two felony charges for attempting to vote as an unqualified elector. 
According to a timeline from WDIV Local 4, Nessel filed a petition for a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of election fraud against four members of city council and a former council member in March. 
Nessel spokesperson, Danny Wimmer, said the Prosecuting Attorney’s Coordinating Council placed the investigation in the hands of the Monroe County Prosecutor’s office on May 21, referring any questions to their office.
According to a report from the Detroit News, Nessel’s decision to seek a special prosecutor was based on the attorney general’s previous criticism of the Hamtramck City Council’s anti-LGBTQ+ policies and Nessel’s decision to prosecute pro-Palestinian protesters at the University of Michigan. Nessel is gay and Jewish, with the petition aimed to circumvent any allegations of bias against Muslim or Arab individuals, with one in five suspects of Arab descent.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Power & Light has reached an 11th-hour “agreement in principle” with parties objecting to its proposed four-year, $10 billion rate increase, but the details remain undisclosed.
The investor-owned utility made the announcement Friday, just three days before the Public Service Commission was scheduled to begin a hearing on the the proposed rate hike.
The utility giant said the agreement would be finalized and made public by Aug. 20. The yet-to-be-announced-rates must still be approved by the PSC.
FPL released a statement announcing that the rate settlement “would keep customer bills well below the national average through the end of the decade.”
“We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with key stakeholders. A settlement would provide a win for our customers and the state of Florida. We appreciate the constructive engagement of key intervenors,” FPL CEO Armando Pimentel said in a news release.
The company announced that the settlement was supported by 10 groups of heavy power users, including the business-friendly Florida Retail Federation, and consumer advocate groups like the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.
During Monday’s PSC hearing, initially set to hear from parties to the rate-setting procedure, but diverted in light of the provisional settlement, critics targeted the proposed rate increase as the product of “corporate greed.”

Zayne Smith, senior director for advocacy at AARP Florida, said she still opposes the agreed-upon rates and criticized that the settlement wasn’t publicly available for review.
“It actually doesn’t give much hope at all, because the settlement totally eviscerates any transparency and accountability rate payers like you and me and anyone watching this from their homes have when it comes to decisions that are being made on our behalf,” Smith said Monday before the PSC met. 
Smith said seniors and others on fixed incomes will be hit hardest by the increase, arguing a $5-$15 increase on power bills could be the difference between being able to buy groceries or gas for the month. 
AARP Florida delivered 34,000 signed petitions opposing the increase to the PSC meeting on Monday. Of those, 12,000 were mailed in and 22,000 were completed online.
“This is the perfect signal to our legislative body that reform at the public service commission is necessary,” Smith said. She wants the Legislature to revisit the issue, noting that Sen. Don Gaetz filed  SB 354, during the 2025 session but that it never attracted a House sponsor. 
That proposal aimed to increase transparency and hold utility companies more accountable for how they set rates.
FPL’s initial proposal would have increased by 2029 what the “typical” FPL customer in Florida would pay by up to $18 per month, according to the company.
FPL serves more than 6 million accounts and 12 million people in Florida. It’s parent company, NextEra Energy, is Florida-based and publicly traded.
The agreement, Smith said, should be the “perfect catalyst” for legislators to start a conversation on changing the process next year.
“Any agreement that we reach should enable FPL to continue to make smart investments on behalf of our customers, ensuring that we can continue to provide reliable electricity to power our fast-growing state while keeping customer bills low,” Pimentel said.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out. 










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Public school enrollment continues to fall

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

BURLINGTON — They are made up of cabins scrawled with old camp signatures, wide lawns, friendship bracelets, campfires, lake games, tearful partings and general childhood delight. Summer camps have been the launching ground for life lessons for decades of American kids, but the latest threat to preserving that magic could be climate change. 
In light of the recent flooding at Camp Mystic in Texas, dangerous weather presents a very real threat. Now, Vermont summer camps are working to learn from the tragedy to better ensure camper safety.
Summer weather has been big news in recent years, and locals have taken notice. Scott Whittier, the warning coordination meteorologist in Burlington for the National Weather Service, said that the most noticeable change is the variations and persistencies of weather extremes.
In past Vermont summers people might experience higher heat days, Whittier said, but typically a cold front would follow to provide some relief. However, within the last five to 10 years,  periods of high heat last longer. On June 22, Burlington reached 99 degrees, the fourth-highest temperature on record for the city in history. 
A warmer atmosphere can hold 4% more water vapor for every one degree Fahrenheit of increased temperatures, according to Whittier.
“If we’re continuing to have a climate that is warmer and warmer, that gives us more potential for more water in the atmosphere to eventually rain down,” Whittier said. That means heavier rain events.
Over the course of the last half-century, annual precipitation in Vermont has increased about 20%, according to Whittier. But the frequency of heavy rainfall events up to 4 inches have seen a 200% increase. Vermont is seeing more heavy rainfall episodes, and in between those episodes, drier, hotter periods that last longer.  
The American Camp Association, a membership organization that has accredited more than 3,500 overnight summer camps, plays a crucial role in promoting safety precautions to camps certified in its network.
While Camp Mystic was not ACA accredited, the organization released a statement in regard to the tragedy and the aftershocks it sent through the camp world. 
“In times like these, the loss of even one life touches every camp, because the camp community is and has always been deeply interconnected,” said the ACA in an online statement . “We stand together in sorrow, in solidarity and in support.” 
This ACA statement said it was working as a resource to support those impacted by the tragedy and to provide camps with more resources to listen to local needs.
Michele Rowcliffe, executive director of the ACA’s New England office, spoke to Community News Service prior to the tragedy at Camp Mystic about the work being done to combat the changing climate in the camp world. Prior to the event, Rowcliffe said the shifting environment is something camp professionals are taking seriously. 
“It has been a heightened conversation. I’d say camping is a really resilient and flexible industry. I think that camps and camping professionals are super nimble,” Rowcliffe said. “As part of licensing, as part of accreditation, having emergency action plans are required. So there’s always a plan A, a plan B, a plan C.”
Even with the shifting environment, Rowcliffe reiterated the important transformative experiences that summer camps provide youth. 
“While the world changes so fast, there are some of these traditions of camping that haven’t changed, and it’s basically working together, learning group work, learning conflict resolution, making decisions without a parent or caregiver being there, being out in nature,” Rowcliffe said.
While flooding is at the forefront of everyone’s mind, high heat can also pose a potentially dangerous threat to campers if not properly prepared for. Hosmer Point, in the Northeast Kingdom, and Camp Farewell, in Newbury, are both ACA-accredited camps pivoting their programming under climate change.
Hosmer Point Camp Director Carrie Glessner said she expected the ACA to release new guidelines for all accredited camps later this summer. But, while flooding is an issue Hosmer Point was aware of at other camps, its location meant it wasn’t an issue on their property, Glessner said. 
“Hosmer Point is on a hilltop, and although our cabins are next to Great Hosmer Pond, the pond itself is at the top of the watershed — no rivers drain into it — so there is no appreciable flood risk at our site,” Glessner said. 
But after the floods in 2023 and 2024, though Great Hosmer Pond was unaffected, the camp realized that if local roads were closed, they needed emergency routes off the property. Glessner said more food is now kept on the property in case of delivery delays. 
Glessner says the biggest issue for the camp is frequent thunderstorms because their location on a hill puts them at greater risk for lightning strikes. This threat, mixed with unpleasant weather, means camp activities must be moved inside. 
“We’ve been investing more time and budget on indoor activities to improve that area of our programming, but it’s still a challenge for staff to bring the enthusiasm if we have multiple days in a row of thunderstorms,” Glessner said. “We have a detailed protocol for thunderstorms — when to keep biking and boating trips near shelter and when to bring everyone indoors.”
At Camp Farewell, which also wasn’t affected by flooding in 2023 or 2024, directors Rachel Morgan and Marley Hansensaid the camp is learning to prepare and pivot in the event of heavy rainfall. 
“We always have our staff plan for the fact that we know we’re gonna have rainy days so they go into the summer having rainy day plans,” Morgan said. “We keep going as much as we can, but obviously safety comes first. But we’re resilient.”
The same flexibility is essential when the heat index turns dangerous. 
“For us, it means turning every activity possible into a water activity, not planning running-in-the-sun activities, lots of coolers of lemonade, making sure campers have bedding for hot weather and really doubling down on the reminders to drink water,” Glessner said. “There are more hot days now, but it doesn’t change what we do for them.” 
At Camp Farwell, altering activities like turning regular tennis into water balloon tennis helps cool down campers, or switching out baking classes with smoothie making. 
“Pivoting and making the best situation can be really positive and leave really great memories, especially when it’s impromptu and the kids haven’t experienced it before,” Hansen said. 
In the wake of tragedy and change, summer camps are looking toward the future.
“One thing that I’d want to point out is the resiliency, the flexibility, the loyalty and passion that folks have in this industry,” Rowcliffe said. “So many people have been in it for decades and we really believe in what we’re doing and making a difference in young people.”

(Photo by Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)After one of the most bitter contract campaigns in recent memory, members of the union representing some 18,000 state employees approved a two-year contract that largely maintains the status quo with modest pay increases.
Although voting, dues-paying members supported ratifying the contract by a wide margin — 6,857 to 1,813 — the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees said the 79% approval was the lowest since the union went on strike in 2001.
MAPE President Megan Dayton said in a news release on Friday that the relatively lackluster response to the contract was “an indictment on the anti-worker attacks from Gov. Tim Walz.”
Many MAPE members, who work in hundreds of different jobs from data analyst to social worker, have been fuming at Walz since he ordered state employees back to the office part time. Workers held protests outside the governor’s residence in St. Paul, and many said they’d be willing to strike over the directive.
The continued icy relations with a major public employee union — a key Democratic constituency — comes just weeks before Walz is expected to announce his re-election plans.
In the end, the union backed down and settled for a contract with no significant changes to the return-to-office policy that took effect June 1. One minor tweak: The state must provide 21 days notice for telework changes, up from 14 days.
“While this contract does not give us everything we deserve, especially on telework protections, it is a hard-fought foundation for future progress,” Dayton said.
It’s unclear how many MAPE members had telework arrangements. The union says state officials pleaded ignorance, although Walz has said about 60% of state employees worked in-person during the pandemic.
The union did claim victory in beating back state health care proposals that they estimated would raise workers’ costs by thousands of dollars a year.
Workers will receive a 1.5% raise in the first year of the contract and a 1.75% increase in the second along with seniority raises. The modest increases reflect the state’s cloudy budget forecast with a significant deficit on the horizon. If inflation matches projections — estimated to remain stubbornly elevated in the wake of President Trump’s import taxes — then workers’ raises might not keep up with the cost of living.
The union also beat back a proposal from the state to allow for “emergency layoffs” during epidemics, natural disasters and other “fiscal exigencies.” The new kind of layoff would have allowed the state to idle workers without having to follow the usual contractual procedures governing layoffs, like placing laid off workers in vacant positions at the same seniority level.
AFSCME Council 5, which represents another 18,000 state employees, announced a tentative agreement on the same day as MAPE in June but did not respond to inquiries about whether their members had ratified the agreement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230117-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-11 17:57:24.627960

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Oat harvest is a week behind last year’s schedule and five days behind the average, according to the crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
The first full week of August followed trends from July with above-average precipitation across the state, though Iowa crops continue to progress well. 
Overall 83% of the oat crop has been harvested. South-central Iowa has the highest percentage of acres harvested at 96% of its oat acres. 
Corn acres are about one day ahead of schedule with a reported 68% of acres having reached the dough stage, characterized by a doughy consistency inside the kernels. In about 15% of acres the corn has already dented, which is on par with the five-year average.

Soybeans are ahead of last year by two days, but behind normal by three, with 75% of acres having set pods and 93% of the crop blooming. 
More than 80% of both soybean and corn acres in the state rated good to excellent, according to the data collected by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. Hay and pasture conditions rated similarly for the reporting period of Aug. 4 through Aug. 10. 
Just 3% of alfalfa hay remains to be cut for the second time and half of alfalfa hay acres in the state have been cut for a third time. 
Heavy rainfall in western Iowa left farmers in the region just four days suitable for field work during the reporting period. Other regions had 5-6 days suitable for field work. 
Communities in western Iowa received more than 3 inches of rain during the past week, though Pacific Junction logged the state’s highest precipitation for the reporting period of 6.64 inches.
The average precipitation for the time frame was 1.6 inches, or six-tenths of an inch above the normal, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan. 
“August’s first full week was unseasonably wet across western Iowa with drier conditions southeast,” Glisan said in the report. “A wet reporting period along with the 2nd wettest July on record aided in the removal of all remaining drought from Iowa.” 
Across the state, the majority of cropland, around 70%, has adequate topsoil and subsoil moisture conditions. North-central and central portions of the state have the highest percentages of soils with surplus moisture. Forty-eight percent of topsoil and 49% of subsoil rated surplus in north central Iowa. Central Iowa had 36% surplus moisture in topsoil and subsoil. 
According to the report, fields are beginning to dry following wetness from the past month, but some low spots still have some ponding.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The SUVs pulled up quickly outside of the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston around 10:30 in the morning on June 17. 
Pablo Grave de la Cruz, 36, had just left a hearing inside where he pleaded not guilty to a charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test after being involved in a one-car accident in Coventry. He was dressed for the occasion, in a collared shirt and slacks. He had plans to go out for breakfast.
He heard his name called. Moments later, a half dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents — wearing masks and carrying guns — surrounded and handcuffed de la Cruz, then hustled him into one of the vehicles and drove away. Neither his lawyer nor his friend, Brittany Donohue, who had accompanied him, were allowed to go with him. 
“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” Donohue said. “He was leaving traffic court.”
She was left trembling from the experience and had to wait another 20 minutes before she was calm enough to drive.
De la Cruz has lived in Rhode Island for 19 years and has been married to Sam Spadavecchia since 2016. The couple live in North Providence. De la Cruz came from Guatemala as a teenager illegally out of fear for his safety as a gay person around 2005 the same year Amnesty International wrote, “The LGBT community in Guatemala regularly faces attacks and threats.” Since then, he has worked as a server at two of Providence’s most recognizable restaurants — Los Andes and the Capital Grille — and spent time working or managing others. 
De la Cruz’s enthusiasm and deep menu knowledge made a favorable impression on customers and coworkers at the restaurants where he worked. The Yelp page for Los Andes still includes reviews that single out de la Cruz. “To say he was phenomenal would be an understatement,” one reads. Another advises guests to “ask for Pablo as your server – he was great!”
His arrest is one of a growing number by ICE agents at or around Rhode Island courthouses in recent months. The practice has alarmed advocates, state lawmakers — including two Providence Democrats, Rep. David Morales, and House Deputy Speaker Raymond Hull, who wrote letters of support to the judge in de la Cruz’s immigration case — and even the chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.. 
In February, agents arrested a Venezuelan man outside the Garrahy Judicial Complex in downtown Providence after he appeared at a hearing for domestic violence charges. 
In July, social worker Diego Tomas Arene-Morley filmed plainclothes officers arresting a woman from Ecuador he had just accompanied as his client to court in Providence. The woman had just had charges dismissed stemming from a domestic violence incident in which she was actually the victim. Video of the arrest, and Arene-Morley’s description of it, went viral on Instagram. The woman remains in ICE custody, Arene-Morley said.
Later in July, ICE agents arrested a Guatemalan man on Benefit Street in Providence right when he left Superior Court after appearing on charges of felony domestic assault and violating a protective order. He was charged with assaulting federal officers after an immigration officer and a DEA agent were injured during a scuffle, the U.S. Department of Justice said.

At least 15 arrests of undocumented immigrants have occurred outside Rhode Island courthouses since the beginning of Trump’s second term, including five outside the traffic court, said Juan Pablo Ocampo-Sheen, coordinator for the Immigration Coalition of Rhode Island. But that estimate is likely an undercount since the coalition doesn’t hear about every arrest, Ocampo Sheen said.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent agency for ICE, says courthouse arrests make common sense because they save agents time locating people and offer protection since people they’re looking for have passed through courthouse security screening.
James Covington, a spokesperson for ICE’s Boston field office, said de la Cruz was sought because he had a criminal record.
“Pablo Grave-De La Cruz is an illegally present, 36-year-old Guatemalan alien,” Covington said in a statement. “His criminal history includes TWO convictions for driving while intoxicated, an additional motor vehicle charge and a pending charge for a THIRD DWI. Officers with ICE Boston arrested Grave-De La Cruz in Cranston, Rhode Island.” 
Records show de la Cruz was found guilty of a DUI in 2014 and pleaded no contest to another DUI charge in 2015. He was also cited once for driving without a license in 2010 and driving with a suspended license in 2016. He was charged with DUI and refusal to take a Breathalyzer after his car went off Fish Hill Road in Coventry on June 8, 2025. 
“Allowing this alien offender to remain on the streets of Rhode Island only places the safety of our neighbors in jeopardy,” Covington added in his statement. “ICE Boston will continue to prioritize public safety by arresting and removing criminal alien offenders.”
But courthouse arrests, Ocampo-Sheen said, could make it less likely that undocumented people or those in mixed-status households will report crimes or testify as victims, out of fear of deportation.  
Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island ACLU said courthouse arrests are part of a broader pattern of ICE tactics, including masked agents and smashing car windows during arrests, intended to spread fear. He warns the ripple effects of such tactics could harm even those who support the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration agenda.
“It’s really a dangerous step to take to engage in what is clearly intimidation tactics to prevent people from making use of the judicial system,” Brown said.
“When you get into a car accident and the person who witnesses that you weren’t at fault is afraid to go to court to support your position, you might think twice about whether these actions are in fact in your best interest,” Brown said.
‘Only a matter of time’
The debate over ICE enforcement at Rhode Island courthouses goes back at least to the early months of President Donald Trump’s first term, in 2017, when more than a dozen local organizations sent a letter to Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Paul Suttell expressing concern over ICE arrests at courthouses around the country.  The ACLU, the RI Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the Refugee Dream Center, NAACP, and other groups urged the justice to contact the then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly asking  that agents not conduct such arrests in Rhode Island. 
“We fear it is only a matter of time before it happens here,” they wrote. 
That prediction proved true. 
One month after the letter, ICE agents arrested a Syrian man outside of the Licht Judicial Complex. Abulkhalek Darwich, who had stayed nearly 20 years past the expiration of a guest visa issued in the late 1990s, was facing state charges for the illegal importation and sale of cigarettes. He was taken into custody by ICE following a court appearance in that case. (Later in 2019, Darwich was charged with multiple counts of child molestation and sexual assault.)
Darwich’s detention prompted an outcry from the Rhode Island ACLU, which said, in a statement, “There will be no equal access to justice in Rhode Island if residents are afraid to make use of their judicial system.” 
Suttell — who served as a Republican in the Rhode Island House of Representatives in the 1980s — spoke out too. 










They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist. He was leaving traffic court.

After Darwich’s arrest, Suttell acknowledged federal authorities had a duty to enforce immigration laws. “But at the same time, our courts need to be accessible to everyone, regardless of immigration status, whether they are a crime victim, a witness, someone seeking a protection order or someone simply looking to pay a court fine,” he said.
In 2020, Colorado and New York passed laws aimed at curbing ICE arrests at courthouses. A third bill passed in Washington that year required courts to document instances of federal law enforcement entering courts for non-court-related business and prohibiting judges, prosecutors, and court staff from collecting or sharing info about immigration statuses unless relevant to a state criminal offense. 
In 2021, the Biden administration issued a memo that acknowledged courthouse arrests “may chill individuals’ access to courthouses and, as a result, impair the fair administration of justice.” It encouraged agents to conduct them only in a narrow set of circumstances. That memo was rescinded on the day of Trump’s inauguration for his second term in January. Since that time, ICE has ramped up arrests in every state, including courthouse arrests. 
Even in states with laws or rules designed to stop courthouse arrests, the issue remains unsettled. In Colorado, following reports of ICE arrests in defiance of the state law, the state’s ACLU sent a letter to ICE and DHS demanding a stop to the practice. In New York, the Trump administration sued the state to challenge its law protecting against courthouse arrests. In Ohio, after judges in Franklin County passed rules prohibiting immigration arrests at courthouses, lawmakers introduced a bill that would nullify such policies across the state. 
Bills stall in Rhode Island
For the past three legislative sessions, Rhode Island lawmakers in both chambers have introduced legislation that would limit ICE’s ability to perform civil arrests. The latest versions of these bills — Senate Bill 0291 and House Bill 6121 — were introduced by Sen. Meghan Kallman, a Pawtucket Democrat, and Rep. Jose Batista, a Providence Democrat, during the 2025 legislative session.
Their bills wouldn’t have prohibited law enforcement officers from making an arrest at a courthouse if they have a warrant or if officers directly witness a crime. But the legislation sought to categorize civil arrests at courthouses as contempt of court and false imprisonment, and allow both the arrestee and the attorney general to sue for relief. 
Both bills were held for further study after committee hearings. And both lead sponsors say they intend to file the bills again in 2026. 
 “As a matter of practicality, our judicial system relies on all Rhode Islanders having free and fair access to the courts — whether as defendants, plaintiffs or witnesses — without fear of detention and deportation,” the sponsors wrote in a March opinion piece. 
Kallman said the bill is about protecting public safety.
“If the argument is that we want life to be safer for Rhode Islanders, then one of the ways that we need to do that is make the courts as safe as they possibly can be from outside interference,” she told Rhode Island Current.  “And outside interference, in this case, is ICE.”  
Kallman said she intends to submit legislation that would prohibit federal agents from conducting an arrest while masked.
Batista said he sees protecting immigrants’ basic rights as a moral imperative. “I feel like we’re literally living history, but in a bad way,” he said. “This bill is me embracing one of the few things I feel like I can do.”

Local efforts to mobilize
Absent local legislation or rules preventing ICE arrests at courthouses, some Rhode Islanders are working to disrupt enforcement on their own.  
In July, the Olneyville Neighborhood Association (ONA), Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance (AMOR), and Rhode Island chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL)  launched a petition aimed at Gov. Dan McKee, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley, the Providence City Council, and Suttell. Calling ICE a “pandemic,” the petition demanded that courts across the state offer virtual hearings, trials, and conferences, “to all community members until they actually ensure real safety for our community members by banning ICE from the city.” 
On social media, PSL and AMOR have been posting regularly about what they believe to be ICE near local courthouses. One post from late July included footage of two men wearing face coverings, tactical vests, guns holstered to their thighs and metal badges affixed to their clothing, with the Garrahy Courthouse visible in the background. “We know we can’t rely on politicians and their empty promises,” the caption read. “We have to take matters into our own hands and get organized in huge numbers to make sure ICE does not take anybody else from the courthouses.”










It’s really a dangerous step to take to engage in what is clearly intimidation tactics to prevent people from making use of the judicial system.


– Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island ACLU


Arnoldo Benitez, an immigration lawyer with an office in Providence, said he has had at least one client detained by ICE. 
Once a person is in ICE custody, it’s virtually impossible for them to participate in their state-level criminal proceedings, and so those local cases can remain open for years, Benitez said. If the person leaves the country, their still-pending criminal charges can make it difficult or impossible to come back legally. That’s a threat to due process, he explained. 
“There goes the presumption of innocence, there goes your right to confront accusers, there goes your right to stand trial,” Benitez said. “All of your constitutional rights are just gone because you are not afforded that opportunity to fight your case.”
Benitez is torn over what to tell his clients who are scared to go to court. He can’t advise them not to go. “I do have to warn them that there is a chance that ICE can be there and can detain you,” he said.
Moved without notice
Spadavecchia drove to ICE’s field office on Jefferson Boulevard in Warwick after de la Cruz’s arrest to try to see his husband but was denied. Instead, Spadavecchia was given a bag of de la Cruz’s belongings, including his wallet, phone, and wedding ring. 
De la Cruz was eventually transferred to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where he spent five days before being transferred, without notice, to a detention facility in South Texas around 20 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. Spadavecchia learned his husband had been moved after it happened, via a phone call from de la Cruz. Before hearing from his husband, he had spent hours calling the Wyatt in search of his husband’s whereabouts. 
De la Cruz’s friends and family members spent a month unsuccessfully trying to secure his release. Then they launched a GoFundMe fundraiser that has now raised more than $28,000. His case has been covered by  WPRI, the Valley Breeze, and Newsweek, which ran the headline, “ICE Detains Man in US Since He Was a Teenager at Traffic Court.” 
GoFundMe organizer Amanda Fullam said she wants people to know that ICE kidnappings” aren’t just targeting dangerous criminals. “They’re happening to our neighbors and our friends,” Fullam told Rhode Island Current. “And they’re not being given the treatment or the opportunity that they should and that they deserve.”
Spadavecchia, who works as a sales and marketing director for an event transportation company, said he and de la Cruz spent nearly a decade trying to get proper papers for de la Cruz to gain legal status in the U.S. Among the forms they have in various stages of processing: an I-589 application for asylum, an I-130 petition for an alien relative, and a I- 601A application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver. “It shouldn’t take 10 years…to get a green card,” Spadavecchia said.  
At an Aug. 7 removal hearing with an immigration judge in Texas, de Le Cruz was granted permission to voluntarily self-deport. Given the facts of his situation, this was a good outcome, Spadavecchia said. If de la Cruz had been involuntarily deported, the path back to Rhode Island, if one exists at all, could take years. He must leave the country before Sept. 5. Spadavecchia said he plans to visit him in Guatemala.
Spadavecchia wants to share his husband’s story not to scare undocumented people, but to inform them of the risks. 
“I’ve told everyone, ‘If you have a court case, just don’t go. Send somebody else…Pay the fine,’” he said.
On a recent afternoon at the couple’s house in North Providence, the dining room table had two table settings, with plates, silverware, cloth napkins. They had been there since the day that de la Cruz was first detained in June. 
Spadavecchia, his voice cracking, said removing the table settings would be a form of giving up. And he wasn’t ready to do that. 
When de la Cruz was granted permission to self-deport, Spadavecchia said he finally felt enough closure to sit at the table for dinner. That night he made his husband’s favorite dish: pasta bolognese.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside Richmond City Hall Monday afternoon to protest what they called an escalation of immigration enforcement across Virginia and to demand the city cut ties with federal immigration authorities.
Organized by Virginia Defenders for Freedom, Justice and Equality and several allied groups, the rally came in the aftermath of multiple Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detentions in Richmond over the summer. 
Advocates said the tactics — involving masked, plainclothes agents in unmarked cars — were indistinguishable from abductions and denied people any meaningful chance at due process.
“ICE kidnappings have been justified by the false narrative that only ‘the criminals’ or ‘the most dangerous people’ are being detained,” said Fernanda Diaz-Castro, a coordinator with the Virginia Defenders. Her speech was repeatedly interrupted by chants of “No Justice, No Peace” from the crowd and honks from passing drivers. 
“Not only does this divide-and-conquer rhetoric enable the dehumanization of our migrant communities, but it is also a lie disproven by ICE’s own data,” she added.
According to ICE statistics cited by Diaz-Castro, 868 people have been detained this year at Virginia’s two immigration detention facilities — Caroline Detention Center in Caroline County and Farmville Detention Center. She said 80% were classified by the agency as posing “no threat,” meaning they had no criminal record.
 Recent arrests draw scrutiny

The rally followed a series of enforcement actions in late July, including one in which 21-year-old Ricardo Martinez-Cantero was stopped while driving to work at a construction site in South Richmond. According to advocates, his vehicle was boxed in by unmarked cars, his window was smashed and he was pulled out and restrained before being taken into custody.
Advocates said his mother was unable to reach him for hours, and that attorneys and community members could not locate him in federal custody until two days later. By that point, Martinez-Cantero had already been transferred to Louisiana for processing. By Sunday morning, he had been deported to Honduras, seven hours from his hometown.
In a letter read aloud at the rally by Ana Edwards, chair of the Sacred Ground Historical Reclamation Project, Martinez-Cantero described being held in crowded cells without adequate food, witnessing another detainee suffer a seizure without prompt medical care and being moved between facilities before his deportation. 
He wrote that when confronted by agents, “I felt like the weight of the world was on top of me” and that his deportation left him “alone and afraid” in a country where he fears for his safety.
ICE officials did not respond Monday to a request for comment about the July arrests or the protesters’ allegations regarding tactics and treatment of detainees.
 Enforcement policies under scrutiny

Federal immigration enforcement has been a growing point of contention in Virginia this year. 
In February, Gov. Glenn Youngkin ordered state police and the Department of Corrections to cooperate with ICE on detainer requests and information sharing, a move his administration said would help “remove violent criminals from our communities.” 
Immigrant advocates argue the policy instead fuels fear, discouraging victims and witnesses from contacting police, and has expanded the scope of people targeted for detention.
According to recent ICE and advocacy group data, Virginia’s detention facilities are operating near their highest capacity in years. Caroline Detention Center, which has a contract to house ICE detainees, was at about 80% capacity earlier this year — its highest level since 2020.
Arrests have also been documented at or near courthouses, and during routine check-ins with immigration officers. 
Those practices have drawn criticism from lawmakers including U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, who last month visited the Chesterfield County Courthouse to highlight concerns about people being detained there.
Diaz-Castro said Monday such gestures fall short. 
“It is simply not enough for politicians to hold a press conference condemning actions taken by ICE without tangible plans to back it up,” she told the crowd. “We need to see elected officials take concrete measures to protect all community members.”
 Policy demands

At Monday’s protest, the Defenders outlined a list of changes they want city officials to pursue.
They urged Richmond to pass legislation prohibiting police and other city agencies from cooperating with ICE — a step some Virginia localities have already taken. Arlington County, for example, strengthened its “Trust Policy” in late 2024 to increase protections for immigrant communities after data showed many residents feared calling 911. Advocates said Richmond should make a similar commitment to public safety for all residents.

The group also called for an end to masked and unidentified policing. They want the city to make it illegal for officers or federal agents to carry out arrests in plain clothes, unmarked vehicles, or without visible identification, and to require judicial warrants for all immigration-related arrests.
Another demand is that Richmond refuse to renew contracts for Flock Safety surveillance cameras, which track vehicle movements and can be used by law enforcement without a warrant. Advocates argue the technology enables unchecked surveillance and can be used to target immigrant communities.
They also pressed city officials to secure rapid legal representation for detained residents, provide financial support to families who lose breadwinners to deportation, and oppose the expansion of detention facilities in Virginia. In the longer term, the group wants all existing facilities closed.
In addition, the Defenders urged elected officials to accompany residents to immigration court hearings, saying a visible presence can deter enforcement actions near courthouses. They also called for more funding to support community organizations such as the Sacred Heart Community Center, which provides language classes, legal clinics and other services to undocumented and under-documented residents.
 Emotional appeals from the podium

Speakers’ remarks alternated between policy arguments and personal accounts intended to humanize the impact of enforcement.
Josue Castillo, a community organizer with New Virginia Majority and the son of Honduran immigrants, said the raids have sown fear in neighborhoods and fractured families. 
“Every single person detained by ICE is more than a number,” he said. “They are a loved one, they are a friend, they are a parent or a child. … All of them have lives and stories that were senselessly uprooted by the hands of masked cowards.”
He said parents are now having difficult conversations with children about the possibility they might not come home from work one day. “These are real stories that are happening every day in this city, the state and across the country,” Castillo said.
The Rev. Rodney Hunter of Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church in Richmond compared ICE’s tactics to those of “kidnappers” and said constituents must hold officials accountable to “protect the citizens’ rights.”
In an interview with The Mercury, Nancy Wein, co-chair of the Virginia Coalition for Human Rights, called the situation “dire” and said advocacy needed to include both lobbying lawmakers and physically showing up at courthouses to support people facing deportation.
As the rally wound down, Diaz-Castro told the crowd their work was just beginning.
“If elected officials won’t protect us — we will,” she said, her voice carrying over the noise of downtown traffic.
Protesters carried signs reading “ICE out of Richmond” and “Police state is not our fate” as they dispersed into the heat, many saying they planned to be back at City Hall for the next council meeting on Sept. 8.

(Getty Images)Property insurance may be what’s on residents’ minds as Florida continues to grapple with high housing costs, but people need to look out for soaring health insurance costs in the coming year, too.
Fourteen insurers writing individual policies in Florida have proposed double-digit rate increases for Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in calendar year 2026, a review of federal data shows.
The Centers for Medicare & Medciaid Services (CMS) data show that Molina Healthcare wants an overall rate boost of nearly 41% for calendar year 2026, more than any other plan. According to its supporting documents, the increase could affect more than 90,000 policyholders. 
AmeriHealth Caritas requested the second highest overall rate hike at slightly more than 37% overall. Its justification data indicate the hit would average 35% for 55,000 policyholders.
Centene Venture Co. Florida requested the smallest rate increase, 18.73%. According to its supporting data, the increase would affect an estimated 1.3 million individuals.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida proposed an overall rate change of nearly 27%, according to the CMS website, although its rate justification notes that some members will experience increases above 15%.

Not alone
The proposed rate changes are preliminary and could change during the rate review process, which is expected to be completed by the federal government at the end of the summer. Open enrollment for 2026 individual coverage under the ACA, also known as “Obamacare,” through the federal  health insurance marketplace begins in the fall, as it does for most employer-sponsored insurance plans.
The federal government presents the rate changes in terms of an overall increase because the amount charged individuals varies depending on their geographic location, age, and which tier plan they choose to enroll in: bronze, silver, gold, or platinum.
Florida is not alone in these rate hikes — insurers nationwide are filing double-digit increases. A KFF review of marketplace plans submitted by 312 insurers in 50 states and the District of Columbia shows that the median proposed increase for 2026 is 18%, more than double last year’s 7% median proposed increase.
Insurers cited rising costs, utilization of services, and the loss of enhanced advanced premium tax benefits as the reasons behind the rate increases, according to KFF.
Mums the word?
While the proposed increases haven’t been finalized, they are looming and it’s not clear what, if anything, Florida insurance officials are doing to get the word out to people.
Attempts to contact Florida Insurance Consumer Advocate (ICA) Tasha Carter for this story were unsuccessful. There’s no reference to rising health insurance rates on the ICA’s website dedicated to consumer alerts and there’s no reference to health insurance rates in its Current Insurance Topics section.
Florida Conservatives for Affordable Health Care is holding a press conference in Tallahassee on Wednesday morning to address the rising rates and how they will soar particularly for those who have been relying on the enhanced premium tax credits to help with affordability.
‘Conservatives’ rally for continuation of enhanced Obamacare premium credits

Montana State Auditor James Brown issued a statement on Aug. 1 advising residents of the impending increases.
“The increase will affect small group health insurance plans offered both on and off the federally facilitated marketplace (HealthCare.gov as well as indiviudal marketplace plans — the plans used by many Montana small employers, independent workers, and families,” Brown said in the statement. “We want Montanans to be informed and prepared.”
Small-group filings
Carriers also filed proposed rate increases for plans sold to Florida’s small employers for 2026, those with of 50 or fewer workers. While less steep than the individual policies, many of the carriers requested double-digit or near double-digit increases. 
Neighborhood Health Partnership requested the highest overall increase for small group plans with a proposed overall 12.78% rate hike, whereas National Health Insurance Co. came in with the smallest proposed rate increase, at 8.38%.
According to the most recent Florida Office of Insurance Regulation data, most people in Florida who purchased health insurance policies in 2023 have individual coverage, and most of them have policies sold on the federal health insurance exchange.
The 2023 data show that more than 5.8 million people maintained commercial health insurance policies, and most of those people, 3.6 million-plus, had individual health insurance plans. Nearly 1.8 million people had large group plans, those sold to businesses with more than 51 employees. Small group policies insured another 400,164 lives in 2023. 
While more recent data on small group and large group enrollment isn’t avialable Obamacare enrollment in Florida in 2025 topped more than 4.6 million people.

In a video statement, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin called the program set to benefit more than 900,000 low-income households and disadvantaged communities across the U.S. a “grift.”

The federal government killed a program that was designed to reduce the cost of electricity for low-income Vermonters by installing millions of dollars worth of solar energy across the state. 
The state is set to lose $62.5 million in grant funding, according to a letter received by the state on Thursday evening from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
That grant was part of a $7 billion national initiative called Solar for All, introduced by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The program intended to pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country. Approximately 60 grant recipients, including 49 states and six Native American tribes, are affected. 
“The Department of Public Service, with the full support of Gov. Scott’s team, is working with our affected colleagues nationally, as well as the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, to pursue every opportunity including litigation to restore funding to this critical program,” Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of Vermont’s Public Service Department that received the grant, wrote in an email. “That work has just begun and so much more to come.”

On X, formerly known as Twitter, Sanders wrote on August 6 that the program “significantly reduces electric bills for nearly a million working class Americans, creates many thousands of jobs and cuts carbon emissions. That’s why the Trump administration wants to illegally cut it. We won’t let them.” 
The state has spent roughly $150,000 on staffing, and they bill EPA on a reimbursement basis for expenses the month after they incur them, according to Melissa Bailey, director of the state energy office within the Vermont Department of Public Service. 
The state has a grant agreement with Vermont Housing Finance Agency to support planning and implementation of one piece of the state’s Solar for All program, and that agency is  incurring expenses that they would expect to be reimbursed, according to Bailey. More than a third of the $62.5 million grant was awarded in May to the agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing. 
From there, the funds would have been awarded to new affordable housing projects like multi-family apartment buildings, largely benefiting renters, in early 2026.
The EPA said it plans to reimburse states for money they’ve spent implementing the program so far, according to the agency’s August 7 letter.
Partners on the project, however, may not be made whole by a refund from the feds. While the state may attempt to subsidize those costs, the partners have built an annual program and staffing budget based on doing Solar for All work, Johnson said in an email. Those losses also don’t include “the potential loss of reduced energy bills for Vermonters due to this EPA action,” Johnson wrote. 
The cancellation came on the heels of the July 4 passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill. The law repealed grants from a $27 billion Inflation Reduction Act program called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which aimed to lower carbon emissions. One of the three programs within that fund was Solar for All. 
In a video posted on Friday, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said his agency “no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.” 
He called Solar for All a “grift” with 15% of programmatic costs going towards “middle men taking their own cut.”
But for states like Vermont, the purpose of the program was to help low-income energy users.
“Towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar,” Johnson told VTDigger in May. The primary objective of the program, Johnson said, was to deliver the grant’s benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of where they live.

What Congress dubbed a “big, beautiful bill” could be true in several ways. In Montana, experts worry the big bill will be what patients and healthcare systems are left with after changes from the reconciliation package begin to be implemented.
Congress passed and President Donald J. Trump signed the massive budget package, even though the margins were among the slimmest in history.  Democrats warned the new provisions would decimate Medicaid, while Republicans insisted it would only eliminate waste, making it stable for decades to come.
Analysts have been tearing into the exact provisions and wording of the bill as it relates to Medicaid’s operation and funding. Many believe that while Medicaid will remain in place, it is predicted to deeply change, and states like Montana, which have experienced lower uninsured rates and better health outcomes, could see a sudden reversal.
 

  Federal fallout: Medicaid and insurance in Montana 

The Daily Montanan is launching a series of articles that breaks down some of the biggest changes implemented by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in the so-called “Big, beautiful bill.”
All four members of Montana’s Congressional delegation — Republicans Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke — voted for these changes. 
Today’s stories are the first-installment:
Another big change in the Big Sky: Whether you’re one of more than 100,000 people on Medicaid or whether you purchase your health insurance on the marketplace (healthcare.gov), recent federal changes will mean a decrease in people who qualify under expanded Medicaid, as well as hefty health insurance premium hikes from those who purchase a plan. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Is $50 billion enough: Congress has allocated $50 billion to be used for rural state hospitals, which had been identified as particularly vulnerable in the “Big, beautiful” bill. Republicans from rural states demanded the money in exchange for the support, but will the fund be enough? And, what happens after it’s depleted? (Story by Stateline)



In many ways, the changes will likely be a repeat of what happened before Medicaid’s so-called expansion — fewer people who can afford coverage, more denials of coverage, and a ballooning amount of uncompensated or “charity” care for hospitals, health centers and doctors’ offices.
“This is the first rollback ever of our major healthcare programs,” said Drew Altman, President and CEO of KFF Foundation, a large nonprofit, nonpartisan healthcare research organization. “It’s the largest rollback ever.”
The reasons for that reversal lie primarily in the specific provisions changed by most Republicans with virtually no support from the Democrats.  Under the assumption of massive fraud and abuse, and an unsupported belief that millions are out of the workforce, just lapping up free health insurance while on the couch so to speak, many Republicans believe that eliminating fraud and waste, including denying insurance to undocumented immigrants, will make the program stable and solvent.
Before the bill passed, Montana’s senior U.S. Senator Steve Daines told Fox News why he supported the measure:	
    
 
“The bottom line is this, Republicans are trying to save Medicaid. We want to strengthen Medicaid, while the Democrats are trying to drain Medicaid. So the reforms that we are proposing, what you just described there in the so-called provider tax, that’s just a scheme that are used by the states to actually get more dollars than the federal government. This is one of the fastest growing entitlements currently in federal spending. It’s designed to protect those who are most vulnerable. It’s an important safety net, but we’ve got to reform Medicaid if we’re going to save Medicaid. We’ve got to take able-bodied males who are laying on the couches at home and get them back to work and off of Medicaid. Put a work requirement in and the reforms we have made we think are reasonable and it’s, again, the way we save this very important safety net.”

There’s little evidence to support widespread Medicaid. For example, in 2022 Texas reported a fraud rate of more than $219 million, while Montana had just more than $566,000, according to Becker’s Hospital Review. Only five states had less. According to the most recent data from Montana, 97% percent of those enrolled on Montana’s expanded Medicaid work at least part-time, if not full-time, or fit other exemptions like being a full-time student, caring for a family member or having a disability. The remaining 3% is estimated to be the natural churn that happens as people come off and onto the insurance, usually after losing or gaining a job.
Because the new changes are only beginning,  exact numbers for Montana are not publicly available, but using national data, officials can estimate the impact. In January, there were approximately 71.4 million people on Medicaid’s insurance programs, which includes the Children’s Insurance Program, or CHIP, according to the Pew Research Center. Current national estimates  say that an estimated 10% could lose coverage. In Montana, that translates to around 10,000 residents losing coverage.
Those numbers only reflect half of the risks: The current projections demonstrate the number of people who will lose Medicaid coverage due to work requirements or the new “redetermination” process that requires the state to more frequently check for employment and require more documentation. Most healthcare leaders, including Dr. Aaron Wernham, the CEO of the Montana Healthcare Foundation, say states will have a difficult time with the process given the current staff levels and they say the messy redetermination process that Montana went through in 2023-’24 could become a sort of new normal. What the numbers don’t estimate is the number of people who are wrongfully denied, or simply give up, unable to navigate the new system.
The Daily Montanan reached out multiple times to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services to ask about the changes. No official responded to those inquiries, including how the state was staffed and prepared for the new requirements, which will involve more verification and documentation.
  Two major impacts … so far 

Republicans were correct: Medicaid isn’t going away. Experts who have combed through the legislation say two major changes will likely mean upheaval, though.
The first change involves subsidies for the marketplace or healthcare exchange. During COVID-19, Congress authorized more help for insurance premiums on healthcare.gov. Those COVID-era enhancements are going away unless Congress reauthorizes them, something unlikely given Congress’ current political make-up.
“Premiums in the marketplace will skyrocket by, on average, more than 75% but it’s 90% in rural areas, enrollment will plunge by as much as 50% according to analysis form the actuarial firm, Wakely, and that adds about 4.2 million people (nationally) to the ranks of the uninsured,” Altman said.
The other more noticeable change is more a result of what’s likely to happen, according to Altman: As more people lose health insurance coverage through the redetermination process or through not being able to afford coverage, hospitals and doctors will likely see an increase in “uncompensated care,” often termed “charity care.” For hospitals and healthcare centers that often have margins of less than 2%, a sudden increase in uncompensated care could mean the difference between financial survival and closure. That concern is particularly pronounced in rural areas like Montana, which has a number of small hospitals, called “Critical Access Hospitals,” which have survived the recent tumultuous COVID-era because of reimbursements.
Larry Levitt, the Executive Vice President for Public Policy at KFF, says that it will be the biggest rollback in U.S. history of a major program.
“It amounts to what is effectively a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act, erasing a lot of its gains in health coverage,” Levitt said.
Some rural hospitals have even seen enough stability and success because of fewer uninsured patients to add service lines, like mental health or orthopedic surgery, so that residents can access those services closer to home instead of driving to a more urbanized center.
As part of the “big beautiful bill,” Congress authorized a one-time $50 billion lump sum that will be issued to states in a block-grant format, allowing each state to determine how to best use the federal funds. However, how those funds will be spent is still uncertain, and some hospital leaders say it will just delay an inevitable crisis when the funding runs out and healthcare centers are stuck with more charity care.
“We saw rural hospitals stabilize,” Wernham said. “Now, we’re going to have to see what happens to the rural healthcare systems because they tend to have the lowest margins. That will force many of them to make difficult decisions and figure out how to keep their doors open.”
Wernham said that even as some rural hospitals in Montana opened new “service lines” — for example, surgery or mental health — they may have to be closed. That, Wernham said, doesn’t just affect the Medicaid patients, but the entire community.
“You don’t just cut services that are available to Medicaid, you cut services that affect the entire community whether you have private insurance or not,” Wernham said.
  About those premiums 

Montana Commissioner of Insurance James Brown has already started warning residents that health insurance premiums are expected to rise in 2025, especially on the marketplace exchange. Brown’s office doesn’t control rates, but carriers are required to file their annual rates and plans from now until the middle of August.
“This increase will affect small group health insurance plans offered both on and off the federally facilitated marketplace (healthcare.gov), as well as individual marketplace health plans — the plans used by many Montana small employers, independent workers, and families,” Brown said in a press release. “We want Montanans to be informed and prepared.”
Longtime healthcare navigator Olivia Riutta has another phrase for it — sticker shock.
In Montana, Riutta said, 87% of the state gets tax credits to participate in marketplace insurance. So she said, if 87% of the people get tax credits, then 87% will experience sticker shock.
“We are encouraging people to get your documents and get prepared,” Riutta said.

How Much More Would People Pay in Premiums if the ACA’s Enhanced Subsidies Expired?




 
She said a very basic example of what could change is a “silver” plan offered in Montana. A person making minimum wage — or $10.55 per hour — is eligible for a silver plan for $0 with the current subsidies.
However, without those subsidies, that plan for an individual rises to $63 per month.
“But they’re already having a tough time affording housing or groceries. Now they have to find another $63 per month,” she said.
Many people enrolled in the marketplace received increased subsidies, a holdover from the COVID-era, which helped make health insurance more affordable. For example, those who made too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but struggled to afford insurance, benefitted from the subsidies provided by Congress. That led to more participation in the marketplace. That shift, in turn, meant more people were insured at better prices, and because more people utilized insurance, carriers could spread the risk among a larger group of people. That helped keeping plans affordable.
However, with those subsidies disappearing, premiums are likely to jump considerably, leaving residents with few enviable choices: Either more of their income will have to go toward healthcare premiums, or they will have to choose plans that cover less and force larger out-of-pocket expenses or deductibles.
“At the end of the day, cost (of the plans) is the biggest concern they have,” Riutta said.
Cynthia Cox, the Vice President for the ACA Programs at KFF, said that many people who pay roughly 8.5% of their income could see it that percentage more than double.
Experts say that some may opt for plans with less coverage, making individuals vulnerable to more expenses in case of sickness or surgery. Others, though, may decide against health insurance at all, leaving them uninsured or covered by extremely limited plans that could lead to financial disaster in case of an emergency or disease.
“All of this points to delaying your decision to see a doctor, which as we know, is not best practice,” Riutta said.
She said that the health insurance marketplace has seen “record enrollment” because Congress has made it affordable to different groups. She worries that as the federal government makes it less affordable, there will be a resurgence of uninsured individuals.
However, even a return to previous marketplace times may mean the people purchasing insurance consider it a necessity and may need it for a chronic health condition. That, in turn, means that the pools — or groups — of people are sicker, which also pushes rates higher in the future.
“This isn’t great for anyone in the insurance market because the costs will get spread around,” Riutta said.
Riutta warned that people who auto enroll or are satisfied with their plan, and plan to let it “auto renew,” should make sure they see the premium price differences because the new rules don’t allow the flexibility to change after Jan. 15.
Some may opt to step down a level from a gold or a silver to a bronze plan, but those changes could come with higher out-of-pocket costs.
“What we think is really most important come Nov. 1 — the first day of open enrollment — is that people need to compare and shop around,” she said. “Really understand how a plan does or doesn’t work.”
If people choose not to enroll, it will mean big bills from hospitals or delaying care until they become eligible.
“If people can’t enroll in insurance, what we know is that people will delay care. And that means fewer check-ups and catching things early,” Riutta said, for example typical cancer screenings.
 Uncompensated care 

Many in the healthcare field say they’re already preparing for a rise in uncompensated, or “charity” care, which happens when healthcare systems are forced to see patients and treat them, regardless of their ability to pay. Those losses end up being absorbed or “eaten” by the clinics, which can only handle so much financial loss before shuttering. And, in rural areas, often not served by a lot of healthcare systems, a higher percentage of people are uninsured or come through the doors with unmanaged chronic conditions, like diabetes.
In many ways, the changes to Medicaid represent a sort of turning back the clock when hospitals saw a large number of people come through the emergency room because they had no other option.
The tragedy, at least from Montana’s healthcare providers Wernham said, is that as Medicaid continued to expand and become established in Montana, the average cost of patient was decreasing while the overall health outcomes were increasing, largely because leaders say those with health insurance were managing chronic conditions before they became expensive, life-threatening emergencies.
“What we’ve seen is fewer ER visits. We see costs stabilizing and shift toward outpatient care,” Wernham said. “So even though costs are going up, the costs for adults who are stabilized actually goes down.
Even if the federal government gives Montana enough money to support its critical access hospitals and other healthcare centers, the money is only budgeted through 2030. Montana Hospital Association CEO Ed Buttrey said that while Congress committed a lump-sump payment of $50 billion as a compromise to help garner support from Republican senators in rural states, that will only be given during the course of five years.
After that, he said, rural hospitals may face an eventual economic cliff. Buttrey helped expand and keep Medicaid in the state as a Republican leader in the Legislature.
“It’s not going to help a lot after that,” Buttrey said.
And how those funds will be spread out and used has not yet been decided, adding to small healthcare centers’ anxiety.
Rural health centers could be impacted by being unable to recruit healthcare staff and doctors because of the funding uncertainty, another destabilizing force.
“The downside is that we can’t continue with this type of financial insecurity,” Buttrey said. “What happens after that, when, poof — that money is gone?”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-636170768-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 17:57:24.627960

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
 

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
  How it works 

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
  Hardest hit 

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies (as well as) the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
  ‘Rural at heart’ 

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.




We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association



Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

Denson announced the DMACC Opportunity Scholarship to Iowa State Fair attendees Sunday. He said in an interview the community college wants to “invest in students that are serious about education,” and data from the DMACC Foundation shows those who receive a scholarship from the foundation are around 30 percentage points more likely to complete their education than those who do not receive support.
“There are a lot of individuals that (are) working hard, they’ve got families, and they know they need to improve their lives,” Denson said. “So we want to make sure that we can help them make it happen.”

The scholarship will be established with $45,000 from the Dolores Rawson-Denson Scholarship fund, created by Denson’s mother before her death last year, Denson said. His sister has also donated $5,000 to the new scholarship, he said, with the goal of raising money to expand the endowment and keep the scholarship available far in the future.
According to the Opportunity Scholarship website, in order to qualify for the program, students must demonstrate financial need through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or other documents and be Pell-eligible, as well as meet academic criteria and “commit to completing your program and advancing your future.”
The scholarship established in his mother’s name is available on a rolling basis for students to apply and Denson said he would like the new program to be as well, as no one can predict when something will impact finances or other areas of life. Recipients will be able to use the dollars for tuition, fees, books and other materials needed to complete their degree.
“We can’t do everything, but if we know we’ve got a student that’s been working hard, we’re not going to let one life event squash their dreams,” Denson said.

Ninguna fue aprobada, pero los defensores afirmaron que planean seguir intentándolo.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Recortes de fondos. Redadas cerca de las escuelas. Exclusión de programas como Head Start y formación profesional. Durante meses, la administración Trump ha estado socavando los derechos de los estudiantes sin estatus legal en las escuelas públicas.
 ¿Podría la administración retirarles por completo el derecho a la educación pública gratuita a esos estudiantes? Los expertos afirman que ese podría ser el siguiente paso.
 “La gente lleva un par de décadas preocupada por esto, pero esto es diferente”, dijo Patricia Gándara, profesora de educación y codirectora del Proyecto de Derechos Civiles de la UCLA. “Ahora mismo debemos estar extremadamente alertas. Esta gente no se detendrá ante nada”.
 Un fallo de la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos de 1982, Plyler v. Doe , garantiza a todos los estudiantes, independientemente de su estatus migratorio, el derecho a una educación pública gratuita en escuelas primarias y secundarias. Sin embargo, el año pasado, la conservadora Heritage Foundation solicitó a la Corte Suprema que revocara el fallo y que los estados cobraran matrícula a las familias inmigrantes, incluso si sus hijos eran ciudadanos estadounidenses. La justificación es que las escuelas gastan miles de millones de dólares en la educación de estos estudiantes, dinero que, en cambio, debería destinarse a estudiantes que, junto con sus padres, son ciudadanos estadounidenses por nacimiento.
 El Proyecto 2025, también publicado por la Heritage Foundation, se hace eco de esa visión.
Una política de este tipo tendría un impacto descomunal en California, donde casi la mitad de los niños tienen al menos un padre inmigrante, según el Instituto de Políticas Públicas de California.
 “Esto tendría enormes impactos negativos”, dijo Megan Hopkins, directora del departamento de educación de la UC San Diego. “Para empezar, tendríamos una población con menor nivel educativo y menos alfabetizada, lo que afectaría la economía y prácticamente todos los demás aspectos de la vida en California”. 
 Matrícula para no ciudadanos
 El caso Plyler contra Doe surgió de un caso en Texas a principios de la década de 1980. El estado había aprobado una ley que permitía a las escuelas cobrar matrícula a estudiantes no ciudadanos. El Distrito Escolar Independiente de Tyler, Texas, una pequeña ciudad a unos 160 kilómetros al sureste de Dallas, fue uno de los distritos que lo intentó, lo que desencadenó una demanda que finalmente llevó el caso a la Corte Suprema.
 La Corte Suprema falló a favor de los demandantes, argumentando que los niños que no son ciudadanos tienen derecho a la misma protección ante la ley. Aun así, el fallo fue ajustado —5 a 4—, a pesar de que el tribunal fue más liberal que hoy.
 Desde entonces, el fallo ha caído prácticamente en el olvido. Sin embargo, ha habido intentos ocasionales de restringir la presencia de inmigrantes en las escuelas, tanto en California como en otros lugares. En 1994 , los votantes de California aprobaron la Proposición 187 , que prohibía a los inmigrantes que vivían ilegalmente en Estados Unidos recibir prestaciones públicas, incluido el acceso a las escuelas públicas. Un tribunal federal la bloqueó antes de su entrada en vigor.
 En 2011, Alabama aprobó una ley que obligaba a las escuelas a recopilar información sobre el estatus migratorio de los estudiantes. Dicha ley fue posteriormente bloqueada por un tribunal federal. En 2022, el gobernador de Texas, Greg Abbott, se declaró a favor de revisar el caso Plyler v. Doe y afirmó que los estados no deberían tener que pagar por la educación de estudiantes sin estatus migratorio legal.
 Desde que la Fundación Heritage publicó su informe, cerca de media docena de estados han intentado aprobar leyes que permitirían a las escuelas cobrar matrícula a los no ciudadanos. Ninguna se aprobó el año pasado, pero los defensores afirmaron que planean seguir intentándolo. 
Ruta a la Corte Suprema
 Es probable que cuenten con un partidario comprensivo en el presidente Donald Trump, quien hasta ahora ha seguido muchas de las políticas propuestas por el Proyecto 2025. En los últimos meses, su administración ha intensificado los arrestos migratorios y ha declarado que ya no reconocerá a las escuelas como refugios seguros frente a las autoridades. También recortó (aunque posteriormente los restableció tras demandas de los estados) la financiación para estudiantes migrantes y prohibió a los estudiantes sin estatus legal acceder a Head Start, la educación para adultos y la formación profesional y técnica.
 El asunto podría llegar a la Corte Suprema de al menos dos maneras. Un estado podría aprobar una ley que permita a las escuelas públicas cobrar matrícula, lo que daría lugar a una demanda que podría llegar a la Corte Suprema. O Trump podría emitir una orden ejecutiva que también podría desencadenar una demanda.
 Erwin Chemerinsky, decano de la Facultad de Derecho de la UC Berkeley, dijo que algunas de las acciones de Trump, como excluir a niños sin estatus legal de Head Start, ya constituyen una violación de Plyler.
 “No cabe duda de que la administración Trump ha aumentado la presión sobre Plyler”, dijo Chemerinsky. “Sin duda, lo que está haciendo Trump podría llevar a casos que llegarían a la Corte Suprema. ¿Podría esta corte revocar la decisión de Plyler? Claro que sí. Bastaría con que cinco jueces quisieran anularla”.
 Incluso si no se revoca, los cambios actuales en las políticas han tenido un efecto negativo en las escuelas y las familias inmigrantes, afirmó Hopkins, de la Universidad de California en San Diego. La asistencia escolar ha disminuido en las comunidades que experimentan medidas drásticas contra la inmigración, lo que ha tenido repercusiones académicas para algunos estudiantes y ha ampliado la brecha de rendimiento entre los estudiantes latinos y otros grupos. Un informe reciente de Análisis de Políticas para la Educación de California reveló que los estudiantes latinos y los estudiantes de inglés obtuvieron peores resultados en matemáticas e inglés tras los arrestos por inmigración en sus comunidades, e informó de un aumento significativo del acoso escolar.
 Hopkins también afirmó que las políticas no son especialmente eficaces. Si el objetivo es animar a los inmigrantes a regresar voluntariamente a sus países de origen, las investigaciones han demostrado que esto no suele ocurrir. Tras la aprobación de la ley antiinmigrante en Alabama en 2011, muchas familias simplemente se mudaron a Misisipi.
 ‘Nuestro mayor miedo’
 En el condado de Monterey, las nuevas políticas han generado temor y confusión generalizados entre las familias inmigrantes, afirmó Deneen Guss, superintendente de la Oficina de Educación del Condado de Monterey. La asistencia ha disminuido no solo en las escuelas, sino también en los eventos comunitarios.
 Para apoyar a las familias, las escuelas han estado organizando noches de información “Conozca sus derechos” (en persona y virtualmente), han alentado a los padres a presentar planes de cuidado infantil a las escuelas en caso de que un padre sea arrestado, han distribuido folletos en español sobre cómo ayudar a los niños que experimentan ansiedad y han proporcionado una amplia gama de recursos legales y de otro tipo.
 Pero cuando la administración Trump anunció que prohibiría la entrada a Head Start a estudiantes sin estatus legal, “me hizo reflexionar”, dijo Guss. “Me hizo pensar que realmente iban a por Plyler. Ese es nuestro mayor temor”.
 Le preocupa el impacto que esto tendría en las familias, así como en el personal escolar, que de repente sería responsable de verificar la documentación de ciudadanía de los estudiantes. Actualmente, las escuelas no preguntan por el estatus migratorio de los estudiantes.
 “El trabajo de los educadores ya es bastante difícil”, dijo Guss. “Nuestro trabajo es brindarles a los niños la mejor educación posible. No nos obliguen a convertirnos en agentes de inmigración. Es un puesto que no queremos”.
 Ha estado instando a los padres y al público a mantenerse informados y alzar la voz. Independientemente de si la Corte Suprema revoca la decisión de Plyler, es casi seguro que las políticas antiinmigrantes continuarán, con consecuencias devastadoras para los estudiantes.
 “No podemos quedarnos de brazos cruzados y fingir que todo va a estar bien”, dijo Guss. “La gente necesita asegurarse de que su voz sea escuchada. Y tenemos que luchar por nuestros hijos”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/02282023_COLISEUMELEMENTARY_PU_CM_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 16:57:03.926001
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-11 20:44:16+00:00,CT Mirror,UI is building a series of floodwalls to protect its coastal substations,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/11/united-illuminating-floodwalls-ct-storms/,The floodwalls are designed to protect infrastructure and prevent major damage from storms that can lead to power outages.,"When Superstorm Sandy sent a nearly 10-foot storm surge into Bridgeport’s South End in 2012, workers at United Illuminating’s Singer substation watched as the floodwaters crept down Atlantic Street before arriving at the base of the plant.
Had waters risen much higher, those workers would have had to cut off the flow of electricity to protect the station’s critical infrastructure  — potentially disrupting power for tens of thousands of people across the region.
“The water level got to under the door and we had people stay here, getting ready to open up circuits,” said Ben Acampora, a construction chief for the utility.

It was not the first time that the substation, which sits in a coastal floodplain, was threatened by a storm surge. A year before, the neighborhood was similarly inundated by Hurricane Irene.
Luckily, neither storm caused much damage to the substation, even as they ravaged other parts of Connecticut. But to avoid more serious consequences from future storms, United Illuminating recently began construction of a 16-foot-high steel floodwall around the substation to keep the waters at bay.
The Singer project — which is expected to be completed in 2027 at a cost of $47 million — is one of three similar floodwalls that the Orange-based utility has either constructed or is planning to build to protect coastal substations. 
Last year, UI finished construction of its first floodwall around the Congress Street Substation, also in Bridgeport. The final project, a wall protecting the Grand Ave./Mill River Substation in New Haven, is due to be completed in 2028, officials said.
The combined cost of all three projects is expected to be $146 million, according to a UI spokeswoman. 
Utilities such as United Illuminating generally operate two types of substations: transmission stations, which send bulk electricity from power plants long distances over high-voltage transmission lines, and distribution stations which take that electricity, lower the voltage and feed it into the local distribution system where it arrives at homes and businesses.

Renni Pavolini, the unit manager of substation projects at UI, said the consequences of flood damage to a transmission station such as Singer could potentially be “catastrophic” for parts of the New England power grid.
“We will have to shut down the substation, and depending on the damage… it could take days, or it could be just hours,” to restore power, Pavolini said. “Our system, the grid, it’s done in a way that if this [station] is down, we probably could feel it with other substations.”
Connecticut’s other major electric utility, Eversource, is also in the process of adding a layer of protection to its network of substations. 
Since 2019, Eversource has spent $9.5 million completing flood mitigation projects at five of its distribution substations around the state, and two more have been scheduled for upgrades. In addition, three substations in the coastal towns of Guilford, Branford and Madison have been removed from service due to the risk of flooding, according to a spokeswoman for the utility.
Elli Ntakou, Eversource’s manager of system resilience and reliability, said the utility recently completed a climate vulnerability assessment to determine which substations or other infrastructure were vulnerable to sea level rise, inland flooding or other climate threats such as drought and extreme heat.
‘We have a granular analysis so we understand the impact to specific assets,” Ntakou said. “The specific stations that we think are higher risk, that’s where we target our mitigations so we make it cost efficient.

The risk that climate changes poses to electric infrastructure is not confined to either utility’s service areas, Connecticut or even coastal regions in general.
Power outages, which can be costly for both utilities and their customers, are growing in frequency across the country due to extreme weather, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. The same report found that climate change could push expenditures on electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure up an additional 25% by 2090. 
The report, released in 2023 under the Biden administration, was removed from government websites after President Donald Trump took office earlier this year.
Locally, the threat floodwaters pose to electric infrastructure is especially concentrated in and around Bridgeport Harbor with its network of substations, transmission lines and power plants.
An ongoing project to build a flood protection system around the city’s South End, known as Resilient Bridgeport, was slated to receive more than $47 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s pre-disaster grant program before the latest round of awards were cut off by the Trump administration earlier this year. (In response, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong joined a lawsuit last month seeking to order the release of that money.)

UI’s Singer Station project, meanwhile, is not reliant on federal funding. Like the utility’s other floodwall projects, it is being paid for by UI customers through transmission and distribution rates within their utility bills. 
The Singer floodwall is being built to withstand FEMA’s estimates for a 100-year flood event, plus an additional three feet of water, Pavolini said. 
In the first phase of construction, crews drove a series of 57 king pile beams into the bedrock below the substation, with their exposed tops forming the skeleton of the wall. From there, steel sheet piles are currently being installed between the beams to form the protective layer around the facility. Two gates allowing access to the substation will be able to be sealed in the event of a storm.
As a last step, the wall will covered with a layer of concrete so that it blends in aesthetically with the rest of the building, before being topped with a security fence.
In addition to the building of walls, UI recently completed construction on its brand new $142 million Pequonnock Substation in Bridgeport. The new substation, which is located on higher ground further back from the Pequonnock River, replaced an older facility that was vulnerable to coastal flooding.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/UI-FLOODWALL-0808-SR-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 16:57:03.926001

Inside, long dumpsters were being filled with the ruined remains cleared out of roadways and people’s homes after flood waters blanketed swaths of Milwaukee County on Aug. 9 and 10. 
Mayor Cavalier Johnson joined DPW Commissioner Jerrell Kruschke at the dump site to provide updates about the flood response Monday. “Some of these stories that we’re hearing are truly, remarkably sad,” said Johnson, recalling that the first message he received was from his uncle, whose basement was filled with water. From the North Side to the South Side, west towards Wauwatosa and east towards Lake Michigan, the flood quickly engulfed roadways and homes. 
“So my thoughts are with everybody, everybody who is dealing with issues trying to clear out a basement, folks that are enduring power outages, trying to sort out, figure out what to do with the car that has been flooded through,” said Johnson. “We’re working through the process of obtaining some disaster declarations so we can bring the appropriate aid to those citizens who have been affected by the downpour.”

Gov. Tony Evers has activated the Wisconsin National Guard to assist efforts in Milwaukee County. It’s unclear at this time what role, if any, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will have in Milwaukee, as the level of damage needs to meet a certain threshold in order for the agency to be activated. The agency has also been threatened with funding cuts and possible shutdown by the Trump administration. 
Johnson stressed that the weekend storm, which dropped over 10 inches of rain in some areas, was extremely rare. Timmerman Airfield recorded over 14 inches of rainfall. “I think I said the other day that last time something like this happened was about a decade or so ago,” the mayor said. “I certainly hope that a storm like this is not visited upon this city for at least another millennium,” he continued, referring to the weekend storm being called a “thousand year flood”. Kruschke echoed the mayor’s comments about the rarity of the massive flooding over the weekend. Johnson said he’d heard on the news that it dropped essentially “a summer’s-worth of rain” in a single storm. 
Yet research on climate change had long-predicted that Wisconsin would experience increased rain, more intense storms, and greater risks of flooding. In late 2020, a report from UW-Madison and state health workers warned that climate change in Wisconsin would mean more rainfall over fewer days, which would likely cause flooding. The report noted that the weather changes could have a cascade of health effects including heat stroke from increased heat (which also fuels more powerful storms), asthma and insect-borne diseases. In 2021, severe storms downed hundreds of trees in Milwaukee County. The following summer, communities across Wisconsin experienced heat waves, heavy rainfall, high winds and tornadoes over a couple of days, during which time people lost their lives to heat stroke, or after being swept away during heavy rainfall. By 2022, global CO2 levels exceeded 400 parts per million, a red line which scientists warned would spur even worse effects.

Answering a question from Wisconsin Examiner about the climate trends, Kruschke said that rainfall events have been documented for a long time, and that DPW is relying on historical data. Kruschke said that the city was not prepared for the volume of rain that fell so quickly. As for whether the city can adapt to future weather patterns, Mayor Johnson said, “I’ve been thinking about this since this storm happened.” 
Johnson praised the DPW’s work with the Milwaukee Metro Sewerage District (MMSD) to create infrastructure to capture rainfall when it hits the ground. “So when you look at our construction projects in the city of Milwaukee, when you see bioswales in the street, that’s to make sure that we keep rain out of sewers. That’s to make sure that we keep rain out of people’s basements. When you see MMSD working to make improvements at the parks in order to capture more rainwater there, that’s in order to make sure that we plan for events like this. When folks are going out to install rain barrels in their neighborhood, that’s in order to make sure that we stop things like this. When you have folks out in the city, like they were during this flood event, making sure that the sewer grates are clear so that water is better able to get into the sewers and not in people’s basements, all of these things play a role, and all of these things make a difference.” 
Johnson said the city will continue investing in “green infrastructure” from roadway design to the creation of outdoor classrooms that  capture rain. “There’s a lot of work that’s going into this,” said Johnson. “I just imagine what this would’ve turned out if we hadn’t done that work over the past number of years. I mean, who knows how many hundreds of thousands or perhaps even millions of gallons of storm water that we were able to capture that didn’t end up in the streets, that didn’t end up in people’s basements.”

The city and county are continuing to assess the full scale of the damage, including  how many homes have been affected and people displaced. Monday morning, the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office stated in response to an inquiry from  the Wisconsin Examiner that there had been no deaths directly linked to the flooding. However, the Milwaukee Police Department’s Harbor Patrol did locate a 49-year-old Native American man, identified as Juan Carlos Sierra Campos, floating face-down in Lake Michigan on Sunday morning. An investigation is ongoing. 
Kruschke said the public works department  will continue working normal hours (7 a.m. to 3 p.m.), and operate special trash disposal procedures for people clearing out damaged or ruined property. Fees will be waived for city drop-off centers, with the centers operating free of charge until Aug. 17. Drop-off centers will also be open Mondays, when they would normally be closed. The drop-off centers are located at 3878 W. Lincoln Ave. and 6600 N Industrial Road. 
A small number of street sweepers are out on the roadways, and some communities  are deploying dump trucks and other vehicles to assist. DPW is also offering special pick-ups for storm-damaged material. Among the items that will not be accepted are  explosive or flammable products, propane tanks, large gas appliances, fluorescent light bulbs, wet or oil-based paint and material or vehicles from contractors or businesses.

Libraries, including the West Allis Library, are offering WiFi and computers for people unable to use their own. Cars that were swept away or abandoned during the floods may have been towed to alternate locations so as to not overwhelm the city’s usual tow yards. The city does not have a count of the number of cars towed or abandoned. Overnight parking enforcement will be suspended Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights.
Residents are encouraged to avoid wading through flooded areas or standing water. The possibility of contaminated water or hidden debris makes wading unsafe. The Red Cross has also opened two shelters for people who have been displaced by the flooding. The shelters are located at the Washington Park Senior Center (4420 W Vliet St.) and at Holler Park (5151 S. 6th St.).",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3076-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 16:57:03.926001

Those 37 companies — which the division listed by name — haven’t complied with Federal Communications Commission rules about responding to government traceback requests, haven’t registered with the FCC’s Robocall Mitigation Databases, or haven’t filed a plan that describes how they will reduce illegal robocalls on their network, according to state officials. 
“By disregarding these simple rules, these companies are allowing robocallers onto their phone networks and then passing their calls on to other downstream providers until they reach the phones of Utahns,” the Utah’s commerce division said.

State officials also said the task force is also sending letters to 99 “downstream providers that accept call traffic from the 37 companies, so that they know they are doing business with bad actors that are not willing to follow the rules that apply to everyone equally. ”
Several of these companies are also being scrutinized by the FCC, according to the division. Last week, it announced that it will remove seven of those providers from the Robocall Mitigation Database, which means that other providers will no longer be able to accept and route calls from their networks. 
The Utah Division of Consumer Protection — which is tasked with safeguarding Utahns from illegal robocalls and other consumer protection issues — encouraged Utahns to visit its website for more details or to file a complaint.

The newly accessible tract represents a little more than half of the Antelope mine's annual production but signals more coal mining actions to come.
The post Trump greenlights 14.5 million-ton coal expansion in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","One of Wyoming’s largest coal mines just unlocked more than 14 million tons of federal coal in the Powder River Basin, a little more than half the volume the mine produces in a year, according to the company.
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement approved the West Antelope II South Tract Mining Plan Modification last week under the direction of the Trump administration, which is “delivering on its promise to revitalize American coal and unleash our nation’s energy potential,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a prepared statement. 
The newly accessible 14.5 million tons of coal will allow the Antelope mine to continue its progression westward toward Highway 59 in Converse County. The mine, operated by Navajo Transitional Energy Company, produces 20-25 million tons of coal annually and employs about 400 miners, according to the company. It’s the third-largest coal mine in the nation in terms of production, federal records show.
The action is in line with President Donald Trump’s executive orders to “reinvigorate” the U.S. coal industry, according to administration officials. “As global instability continues to threaten energy markets, the need for reliable, domestic coal has never been clearer,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Land and Mineral Management Adam Suess said in a prepared statement. “This action underscores our commitment to commonsense permitting, environmental stewardship and energy dominance.”

In addition to unlocking a backlog of federal coal mining plans, the Big Beautiful Bill helps the industry, administration officials say, by lowering its federal mineral royalty from 12.5% to 7% — an estimated $50 million annual revenue loss to the state of Wyoming. Generally, federal mineral royalties are split 50-50 between the feds and the government of the state in which the mineral production took place, but state lawmakers have asked that Wyoming receive a larger slice of that pie given the projected revenue loss.
More coal leasing to come
The Antelope mine expansion technically could have been approved under the Biden administration’s ban on new federal coal leasing in the Powder River Basin because the mine had already obtained the coal lease and its proposed mining plan was initiated before the 2024 “no future coal leasing” plan for the region, according to industry officials. But action on the new mining plan had basically stalled out under the previous administration, according to Wyoming Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti.

“This particular [Antelope mine lease action] has been pending with the Office of Surface Mining for some time,” Deti told WyoFile via email. “While it technically could have happened under Biden, the agency basically stopped all work on program amendments during his term. Language passed in the Big Beautiful Bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to expedite existing leasing action, and so it’s refreshing to finally see some movement.”
Gov. Mark Gordon hailed the Trump administration for taking action on a coal mining plan that lingered under Biden, and said he eagerly awaits approval of another stalled plan in southwest Wyoming.
“While this announcement is a positive step forward, we are also keenly aware of a pending decision on the Black Butte Mine expansion in Sweetwater County, which was also halted by the previous administration,” Gordon said in a prepared statement.
The Interior on Monday launched a 10-day public comment period for Black Butte’s proposed “mining plan modification,” which would tap an additional 9.2 million tons of federal coal. A public meeting will be held virtually from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Aug. 18. Visit this federal website and click on the Black Butte tab for more information about the meeting and how to submit a comment. 
Meantime, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management plans to amend resource management plans for its Buffalo and Miles City, Montana, field offices to undo Biden’s leasing ban in the Powder River Basin, which spans northeast Wyoming and southern Montana, and to “identify areas that may be suitable for future coal leasing.”
Wyoming coal production has ticked up slightly so far this year after dipping below 200 million tons last year for the first time in decades, according to federal data.

The Iowa Board of Nursing recently found that an unlicensed nurse worked at the agency and that ""fraudulent practices"" occurred there related to billing and records. Those findings are now being appealed to district court. (Building photo via Google Earth; document excerpt from the Iowa Board of Nursing) A state agency that denied having inspection records for a Cedar Rapids home health agency now admits it has the records but considers them confidential.
The records are related to Compassion North America, a home health agency whose practices came under scrutiny earlier this year after the Iowa Board of Nursing presented evidence of falsified records, billing for services that were never delivered, and the employment of an unlicensed nurse to provide patient care.
On July 9, the Iowa Capital Dispatch asked the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing for a copy of a private accreditation agency’s inspection report for Compassion North America.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In response to the Capital Dispatch’s request, DIAL spokesperson Diane McCool said DIAL “does not receive survey reports,” using DIAL’s terminology for inspectors’ reports, from accrediting organizations.
After the Capital Dispatch reported DIAL’s claim that it didn’t have the requested records, the Accreditation Commission for Health Care contacted the news organization and said that it had, in fact, provided DIAL with a copy of the documents via email on Sept. 16, 2024.
The Capital Dispatch asked DIAL again for the records, and also requested email communications between the accrediting organization and the state agency.
Last week, DIAL provided the Capital Dispatch with the Sept. 16, 2024, email. The email included no text other than the subject line, and DIAL refused to disclose the email’s attached accreditation report, stating that DIAL was not the “official” custodian of that particular document.
DIAL didn’t explain its initial assertion that it didn’t have the records, nor did it explain how it could be the custodian of an email but not the attachment to that email.
State: Home health agencies aren’t licensed
The Capital Dispatch had also asked DIAL how and when Compassion North America was first licensed by the state, noting that the state agency’s website indicated the company was first licensed in September 2024 — seven years after the company was formed.
In response, McCool said on July 8 that “Compassion North America became certified and licensed to provide medical home health services on Sept. 12, 2024.”
Later, however, DIAL removed that “initial licensing date” from its website. When asked why that happened, McCool said, “Since there is no license for any HHA (home health agency) in the state, we removed the license date. This is consistent with department practice.”
Her statement did not address her previous assertion that Compassion North America was certified and licensed last September.
Because DIAL has never conducted its own inspection of Compassion North America, and because it won’t release its copy of the accrediting commission’s findings, there is no public record of any regulatory oversight of the home health provider, which was first incorporated in June 2017.
No DIAL investigation of allegations
Last month, McCool said DIAL was not currently investigating Compassion North America, despite the findings of the Board of Nursing and its investigator that the company appeared to have falsified records, billed for services that were never delivered, and employed an unlicensed nurse to provide patient care.
Those allegations surfaced at a disciplinary hearing for registered nurse M’balu Madlene Kebbie, who is married to Compassion North America’s CEO, Joseph Lemor.
A state investigator who reviewed the work schedules of Compassion employees as part of a board investigation allegedly found that the license of one of the company’s nurses had expired in January 2021 but she had continued to provide patient care in June and July 2022.
In addition, a comparison of Compassion’s billing records with the staff work schedule allegedly showed the company had submitted payment claims for services for which there was no corresponding documentation to indicate the care was provided. There were also payment claims for services provided by a registered nurse that exceeded 24 hours in a single day, the state investigator testified.
According to the board, Kebbie had no explanation for the irregularities in the nursing documentation — including instances where it appeared Compassion had billed Medicaid twice for some services.
Citing what it called Kebbie’s “lack of previous disciplinary history,” the board ruled that she could retain her Iowa nursing license subject to two years of probation. However, the board’s own records indicate that in 2012, it disciplined Kebbie for working as a nurse while her license was inactive.
Kebbie’s attorney has filed an appeal of the board’s recent decision in Polk County District Court, arguing the sanctions against her are “unreasonable, arbitrary, and excessive.” The state has denied any wrongdoing in the matter.
Lemor has said the state is engaged in a “witch hunt” with regard to Kebbie.  “We did not do anything improper,” he told the Iowa Capital Dispatch last month. “We have nothing to hide.”

The student, Aleysha Ortiz, graduated from Hartford Public Schools last year despite never learning to read or write. Last summer, she spoke to The Connecticut Mirror about her time in the school district, which she entered when she was 6 years old.
[This Hartford Public High School grad can’t read. Here’s how it happened.]
Shortly after her story went public, Ortiz filed her lawsuit. The lawsuit, however, doesn’t seek damages related to her educational attainment. Rather, it focuses on the emotional harm that was allegedly done to Ortiz during her years in the Hartford school district, including by case manager Tilda Santiago.
The complaint alleges that Santiago belittled, stalked and harassed Ortiz in front of other students and teachers. Ortiz went to other teachers in tears and emotional distress as a result, according to the complaint, which also states that Ortiz reported Santiago’s conduct to the principal and assistant principal.
The courtroom arguments on Monday before Superior Court Judge Matthew Gordon focused on two questions: whether the allegations in Ortiz’s complaint were significant enough to prove negligent infliction of emotional distress, and whether the actions of school employees were “ministerial,” meaning the parties were required by law to follow certain procedures but failed to do so. Attorneys representing the city, school board and Santiago argued that their decisions were not ministerial but rather discretionary, meaning they were not legally required to act in a certain way but were rather making decisions based on personal judgment.
Ortiz’s attorney, Anthony Spinella, argued that employees in the district were required by law to follow certain procedures, like reporting bullying to a school administrator, and failed to do so.
“Any school employee who gets a report of bullying has to notify the administrator, full stop. No evaluation, no discretion. They have to file a written report. The policy has to require this safe school climate specialist to investigate or supervise investigation ofall reports of bullying,” Spinella said. “We believe that immunity does not apply because we allege violation of ministerialities.” 
Gordon did not make a decision on the motion on Monday. If Gordon rules in favor of attorneys representing Hartford, the school district and Santiago, Spinella said he would appeal the decision. 
Ortiz is seeking $3 million in damages. Last month, Spinella offered to settle the lawsuit for that amount with the school district and the city.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024_0711_SR__AleyshaUConn_0198-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 16:57:03.926001

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Campaign funds can be used for officeholder security expenses in certain cases, the Oklahoma Ethics Commission recommended in a draft advisory opinion. 
Any “reasonable” expenses must be the direct result of holding the elected state office and would not be incurred if the individual did not hold the office, the draft opinion read. The opinion only covers the officeholder, not family, staff or others connected with the individual. 
The Ethics Commission is expected to hear public comment on the draft opinion at its meeting Thursday ahead of any vote to finalize the opinion. 
“The officeholder must need security to respond to dangers or threats related to the office held, and not simply for security that any member of the public would need,” the draft opinion said. 
“Further, the dangers or threats are related not just to any elected office within the State of Oklahoma, but the office held by that elected official.”
Security expenses must be a direct result of holding a state office. 
“If the expense would exist with or without the elected office, it does not pass the but-for test,” the opinion reads. 
The test refers to an analysis used by the Ethics Commission for officeholder expenses. The test determines whether the expense would be incurred “but for the fact that they were elected to state office.” 
The Federal Election Commission previously issued guidance which allows campaign funds to be used to pay for certain security devices and services to address ongoing dangers and threats. 
The commission voted July 10 to provide an advisory opinion at the request of Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City and House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City. 
Kirt and Munson said they were pleased and encouraged by the draft opinion. 
“Tragic events this past year have left many lawmakers fearful for their safety,” Munson said in a statement Monday. “All public servants should have the support they need in order to best serve their communities. When we are unencumbered by threats made to our personal security, we can ensure a better, more prosperous future for everyone.” 
The request from lawmakers came in the wake of the June assassination of top Minnesota lawmaker, Melissa Hortman. 
Hortman, a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and House Speaker Emerita, and her husband, Mark Hortman, were assassinated in their home. 
Authorities allege Vance Boelter, 57, posed as a police officer to gain entrance to their home and shot and killed the couple. 
He’s also accused of shooting Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife that same night. Hoffman was released from the hospital. He and his wife are recovering. 
Boelter was arrested and faces state and federal charges, some of which carry the potential for the death penalty. 
Investigators said he had a list of other potential targets, including other Democratic elected officials. 
The assassinations have led to public officials across the U.S. feeling on edge and weighing the cost of public service. 
“It’s a privilege to be able to serve our fellow Oklahomans in public office, but the unfortunate reality is, we have seen that service can come with great risk to elected officials and their loved ones,” Kirt said in a statement Monday.

(Getty Images)The Indiana Court of Appeals on Monday affirmed a ruling by a trial court judge upholding the state’s near-total abortion ban, specifically provisions relating to medical providers and potential exemptions. 
The law, which was enacted in a special 2022 session, only allows for exceptions in the case of a mother’s health, rape or incest, or a fatal fetal anomaly — though each with varying time limits. 
Plaintiffs argued that certain pregnancies could imperil the health of the mother, but providers could be afraid to pursue an abortion for fear of the repercussions. Additionally, the law limits all abortion care to hospitals or an ambulatory surgical center, rather than the free-standing clinics who largely performed these reproductive health procedures prior to the ban.

“The circumstances argued by the medical-care providers here generally do not necessitate an abortion to treat those risks,” ruled the panel of judges. “… because the constitutional right to an abortion requires an extreme medical scenario where the woman’s life or health is at serious risk, performing a constitutionally protected abortion in Indiana is a procedure that nearly always will be done in a hospital.
“Thus, the statutory Hospital Requirement is not a material burden on the constitutional right to an abortion.”
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita congratulated the members of his team that argued the case and said “This ruling is a resounding victory for life and the rule of law in Indiana,” Attorney General Rokita said. “Our unwavering commitment to protecting the most vulnerable and upholding our state’s values will continue to guide this office. The overwhelming majority of Hoosiers stand with us in defending the sanctity of life and the health of women across our state.”
The underlying abortion case initially centered on the risk to the health of the mother and the rights of providers, delaying the implementation of Indiana’s ban by roughly one year. After an Indiana Supreme Court ruling in favor of the state’s ban — though left the door open for future challenges — plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, amended their complaint to narrow their focus.
That amended version is the one that the Indiana Court of Appeals weighed on Monday.
Another challenge, regarding whether Indiana’s ban violates its religious freedom law, is ongoing.

Anthony Sykes is named as the public access counselor, according to the complaint portal. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt vetoed the bill because he said the measure would give Attorney General Gentner Drummond “sweeping and unchecked authority” to access records from all state agencies, an “unprecedented” power in Oklahoma. Lawmakers overturned the veto.

Circuit in an opinion filed Saturday denied the Trump administration’s request to halt a lower court’s ruling that required it to once again post information about spending decisions called apportionments.The 27-page opinion, written by Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, said that to “grant the Executive a stay pending appeal in this separation-of-powers standoff would effectively cut the Congress’s purse strings.”“No President would allow a usurper to command our armed forces. And no Congress should be made to wait while the Executive intrudes on its plenary power over appropriations and disclosure thereof,” Henderson wrote. “The public interest is best served by maintaining the separation-of-powers balance struck by the Constitution and especially so if the challenged statutes keep the citizenry abreast regarding duly appropriated expenditures.”Henderson was nominated to the Circuit Court in 1990 by then-President George H.W. Bush, a few years after then-President Ronald Reagan nominated her as a federal district judge in 1986.Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel for Protect Democracy Project, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit, released a statement cheering the Circuit Court’s decision.“Restoration of this website could not have come at a more important time — over the last two weeks journalists have broken story after story of OMB holding back funds using apportionment footnotes — and once this website goes back online we should all have a chance to learn where else OMB has been holding up money that — under law — should be spent,” Lindgrensavage wrote.The Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to a request for comment from States Newsroom on Monday.

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Democratic State Sen. Rosemary Bayer of West Bloomfield announced Monday that she will not seek reelection in what will be a key state Senate district in the 2026 contest.
Bayer has served two terms in the Senate, and was first elected in 2018 representing the state’s former 12th District. The state’s lines were redrawn in 2021 by the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission and Bayer was moved to a new 13th District, which was previously represented by state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak). A winding lawsuit against the commission’s maps ended in the body redrawing the state’s lines once more in 2024 and again changed Bayer’s district.
Despite those challenges, Bayer won in the newly redrawn district, and immediately embraced her new territory. With new changes to term limits for the Michigan Legislature, Bayer had to weigh whether a third run was in the cards and was on the fence about seeking reelection.
On Monday, Bayer told Michigan Advance that it was time to retire.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I was retired before I started this job,” Bayer said. “This was sort of a second act, which was really fun. I got to do something totally different and amazing, but I was already old when I got here. When I first decided to run, I knew the work that I wanted to do was going to take more than four years, so I committed to the eight-year thing. Then they changed it. I didn’t really change, I stayed with the plan, and now it’s time for me to retire.”
That said, Bayer said she will miss the work and the people she’s represented in the Legislature’s upper chamber for nearly a decade.
In a news release announcing her decision, the Senate Democratic Caucus noted that Bayer’s strong desire to improve the state’s educational system motivated her to seek office in 2018 and became one of her top priorities in the Senate, followed by protecting the state’s waters and to help those needing vital mental health care. She viewed her candidacy as a chance to help people in significant ways, and accomplished many of her stated goals.
The caucus noted her work on regulating firearms, collaborating to pass key gun safety legislation that became law in 2023.
Bayer told the Advance that she was floored by the level of inequities in the education system and worked tirelessly to get the state to an equal footing before pushing onward to ensure students of all stripes had what they needed to succeed.
When Democrats gained the majority in the Senate following the 2022 election,  Bayer said she and other education-focused senators managed to create a real model for equity in school funding.
Although budget talks have stalled out between the House and the Senate, Bayer said that her first four years in the minority showed her that both political aisles can work together and did so in the past to ensure schools had the money they needed, and increased the budget in a time of Republican control.
“We took a few more steps when we had our trifecta going strong, but we did a lot before that, working with Republicans,” Bayer said. “I know this thing where we’re stuck right now … it’s not really us collectively. So there’s a bit of frustration on our side. We keep trying to be the grown ups in the room and doing the right thing.”
Bayer said she and her colleagues are resolved to getting a budget done soon that works not only for the whole state but one that continues the hard work she’s put into education through her tenure in the Senate.
“Our job is to take care of Michigan,” Bayer said.
With a new competitive district like the 13th Senate seat now wide open for the taking, Bayer’s advice to her eventual successor  – whom she hopes will be a Democrat – was not complicated.
“It’s always the same: go talk to the people,” Bayer said.
Just because Bayer’s not seeking reelection doesn’t mean the goodbyes should start early, either.
“You can be sure that I’m not going to sit still for the next year and a half,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AMR0157-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 16:57:03.926001

The newly rechristened Storis, formerly the oilfield supply ship Aiviq, is the first in a series of icebreakers expected to join the Coast Guard in coming years. The Storis and subsequent ships, officials said, are critical for the United States to maintain its sovereignty and control of its borders in and near the Arctic Ocean.
“What we’re doing here today is we’re really just preparing to build our Arctic fighting force,” said Troy Edgar, deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, parent agency of the Coast Guard.

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was one of several members of Congress who secured funding for the Coast Guard to purchase the Storis for $125 million under a special contract and operating arrangement during the Biden administration. The purchase deal passed Congress after years of lobbying and political donations by the ship’s former owners.
The Aiviq, built to support Royal Dutch Shell’s oil drilling operations in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska, was available because of a disaster that saw Shell’s drilling rig break loose from the Aiviq during a 2013 storm in the Gulf of Alaska. The rig ran aground in the Kodiak archipelago and Shell abandoned its drill plans for the Arctic.
The Aiviq was modified after post-disaster reviews found flaws in its design, and it went on to serve under contract with the Australian government in Antarctica. Then, the U.S. government became interested in the ship to fill a gap in Arctic coverage.
The U.S. Navy has no icebreakers, which leaves the Coast Guard as the agency in charge of icebreaking operations, critical for opening frozen seas to commerce, research and military missions. The agency currently has just one heavy icebreaker, and that ship is typically assigned to help operations in Antarctica. That leaves the medium icebreaker Healy as the only U.S. icebreaker available for general-purpose missions in the Arctic.
A 2023 analysis by the Coast Guard concluded that the service needs eight to nine polar icebreakers, including four or five heavy ships and four or five medium ones to perform its assigned missions.
“I think Singapore has more icebreaking capacity than we do,” Sullivan said. “That has left us far behind our adversaries. Russia has more than 50 operational icebreakers, many nuclear-powered, many weaponized. China, which has no Arctic territory, is building a polar fleet and is spending a lot of time off our shores, including this summer.”

As Sullivan spoke, China is operating at least five research icebreakers in international waters near Alaska.
Capt. Corey Kerns is the ship’s first commanding officer, fresh from an assignment in Japan as a liaison officer with the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.
“For the Coast Guard, the big strategic thing is to show that we can operate it, get it up north, show the flag,” Kerns said.
During his time in Japan, he became familiar with the disputes over the Senkaku Islands, whose ownership is disputed among China, Taiwan and Japan.
Ships from all three nations visit the waters around those islands.
“The ability to be present guarantees your ability to to maintain sovereignty. And that’s what we’re trying to get at here in the Arctic. We need more icebreakers to be present in our waters and be clear what is our waters,” he said.
 First of many icebreakers planned for Coast Guard

In January, President Donald Trump said he would seek to acquire 40 Coast Guard icebreakers. The “Big Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July included almost $9 billion to build a series of heavy, medium and light ships.
Those include a series of heavy Arctic icebreakers larger than the Storis. The first of those, the Polar Sentinel, is expected to come from Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in 2030, with additional ships every two years afterward.
“This is an amazing moment, because it doesn’t happen that often, but it’s going to be happening a lot more,” said acting Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Kevin E. Lunday.

The Storis is scheduled to be homeported in Juneau, where Sunday’s commissioning took place, but not for several years. For the time being, it will be homeported in Seattle, Washington.
Sullivan, speaking at the commissioning, said he would like to see the new ships homeported in Alaska as well — it’s where the ice is, he said to applause.
The Trump-signed budget measure includes $300 million for a new Coast Guard pier and other facilities in Juneau; construction has not begun, and no site has been finalized.
Both the Storis and the under-construction heavy icebreakers are too large to fit in the Coast Guard’s Kodiak base or in any port north of the Aleutian Islands. The Storis draws 34 feet, according to specifications published in 2013. The new heavy icebreakers are expected to have a similar draft. Either figure is deeper than what’s available in northern Alaska right now.
By the book, said Cmdr. Philip Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, it takes the Coast Guard eight to 10 years to set up a new port from the time it’s chosen.
“We want to move much faster, but there’s a lot of work that has to be done to build out the pier and the shore infrastructure,” Lunday said.
He said things like housing and child care need to be available to accommodate Coast Guard personnel.
Currently, Juneau is experiencing major shortages of both.
“I chair the Coast Guard subcommittee,” Sullivan said, “so working with the Coast Guard, working with Juneau, working with the state, we’re going to press this. We’ve already made good progress on that.”
 Additional work needed aboard Storis

The Storis, too, will need work and testing before it can fully perform its duties. During a pre-commissioning cruise on Saturday for members of the media and the families of the crew, one of the ship’s variable-pitch propellers malfunctioned, helping turn a planned five-hour excursion into an eight-hour one.
The malfunction was a minor one, but fixing it may have required turning off main power for a time, the ship’s captain said, and he didn’t want to do that while families were aboard.
The Storis has a helipad, but a Coast Guard helicopter has never landed there, tried a mid-air hoist, or refueled from the ship. Some labels throughout the ship still bear the name Aiviq, and the ship’s interior art includes photos from Louisiana bayous and New Orleans streets. In the ship’s mess hall are condiments bearing the names of southern grocery stores.

On Saturday’s cruise, employees from Edison Chouest Offshore, the company that formerly owned the Storis, stood alongside uniformed Coast Guard officers on the ship’s bridge.
“He’s my coach,” said Lt. j.g. Sophia Scott of chief mate Devin Keister, who wore civilian clothes next to her.
Since the spring, employees from Edison Chouest have been operating the Storis alongside enlisted Coast Guard members and officers, a unique setup for a Coast Guard ship.
Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, helped organize the purchase of the Storis and the sprint to get it ready.
“I’ll never forget March 4 of 2025 when Admiral Lunday, our acting Commandant of the Coast Guard, directed me and my team to prepare Storis for operations and to sail away from Pascagoula, Mississippi, where the ship had been purchased and put into storage, no later than 1 June of 2025. I’m no mathematician, but that’s less than 60 days later, and at that point, zero crew members had reported aboard,” he said.
After sailing away, the ship spent another two weeks in Seattle for additional work, then arrived in Juneau during the first week of August.
Lunday said the Coast Guard’s partnership with Edison Chouest enabled the Coast Guard to put the Storis in service “much faster than we would have traditionally done.”
“The imperative,” Lunday said, “is that we build out the nation’s icebreaker fleet. When we see the potential adversaries that are moving to build their icebreakers, we’ve got to move faster as the United States, and we’re going to do that. … The original plan was not to have Storis up here for another year, but the national imperative was to move faster, and so that’s why it’s here.”
 Storis has a mixed history

In 2012, while towing the circular drill rig Kulluk from the Arctic Ocean to Seattle, the Aiviq ran into a heavy storm south of Kodiak. The ship’s engines died, the tow line broke, and the Kulluk ran aground after the Aiviq’s crew was unable to re-establish the tow.
No oil spill resulted and no one was injured, but it contributed to Shell’s decision to abandon its Arctic drilling plans.
Two years later, the Coast Guard published a report on the accident, concluding that actions by the tow crew, management decisions and “design engineering deficiencies … relating to the Aiviq” contributed to the wreck.

Specifically, the report noted that vents allowed seawater to contaminate the ship’s fuel.
Since then, those vents have been modified, raised farther above the deck, and the ship went on to conduct two successful voyages to Antarctica. The ship is rated to break three feet of ice while moving at five knots, but during those trips, it was able to break between three and five feet while still moving forward, Baxa said.
After Shell discontinued its Alaska offshore drilling, Edison Chouest lobbied members of Congress and urged lawmakers to purchase the Aiviq for use by the federal government.
The Coast Guard initially resisted. In a 2016 hearing of the U.S. House’s Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, then-Coast Guard Vice Commandant Charles Michel told lawmakers that “our current opinion is that the ship is not suitable for military service, without substantial refit.”
Then-Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, called Michel’s statement a “bulls**t answer” because the Aiviq would be asked to move ice, not perform military duties.
In 2022, after Young’s death in office, Congress passed the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act, which approved funding for the Coast Guard to buy a “United States built available icebreaker.”
The Coast Guard, which had been considering a Finland-built ship, switched to the Aiviq as the only available ship that met Congress’ qualifications.
Subsequent reporting by ProPublica showed an extensive history of political donations by Edison Chouest to members of Congress, including Alaska’s delegation.
“It is ready for Coast Guard service,” Lunday said of the Aiviq-turned-Storis when asked about the July 2016 hearing that labeled the Aiviq as unfit.
“We’ve learned a lot since then, and we’ve had great support from Congress to have the appropriations necessary last year to purchase the ship,” he said.
Sullivan, among the members of Congress who received contributions from Edison Chouest, denied that those donations contributed to the decision to purchase the Aiviq.
“It has nothing to do with it,” Sullivan said. “Zero. I’ve been pressing for more icebreakers any way possible for our country … and the Coast Guard was looking at the idea of a commercially available one.”
 New ship carries relics of prior history

The new Storis is named after its predecessor, an icebreaker that was commissioned in 1942 and served until 2007, becoming the oldest commissioned Coast Guard cutter in the fleet at the time of its decommissioning and scrapping.
In 1957, it and several other ships sailed through the Northwest Passage, marking the first time an American ship had taken that route.
Thirty-two years after that historic voyage, the Storis assisted with the cleanup after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Ed Sasser was a crewman on board at the time. On Saturday, he sailed aboard the new edition of his former ship.
“It’s pretty cushy compared to the old Storis,” he said, noting that both ships were and are unique vessels, not part of a larger class of ships.
If he were young again, he’d serve aboard the new ship “in a New York minute.”
“Time will tell how useful it is,” he said.

Remnants of the ship’s former life remain obvious throughout.
Belowdecks are large steel containers, intended to haul bulk dry concrete or other material to offshore oil fields. For now, they’re empty until the Coast Guard either removes them or finds a use for them.
Other pieces of the Storis’ original purpose could be useful to its new mission. Its stern holds heavy-duty towing gear, and large firefighting cannons jut from its superstructure.
The ship has no internal laboratory space, as does the Coast Guard’s other medium icebreaker, the Healy, but it does have deck attachments for container modules that could allow it to accommodate labs.
Already, one of those spaces was in use Sunday, holding the ship’s brand-new armory, including four .50-caliber machine guns.
“I’ve made this joke for many, many years … it’s that if you can imagine it, and you can put it into a standard 20-foot IMO container, I can embark it on board. … we had on board a very, very senior Marine Corps officer, and he asked, ‘hey, what if I put a Marine Raider team in a box?’ I said, ‘Yes, sir, I can embark that on board.’ It really does provide that flexibility for missions,” Baxa said.
The Coast Guard’s staffing contract with Edison Chouest is scheduled to run through November, and it could be extended for one year.
Both Baxa and the ship’s captain said they’ll be recommending that extension.
Lt. Cmdr. George Greendyk, the engineer officer on board the Storis, said he hasn’t had problems with the Edison Chouest civilian crew.
“Everywhere we go, we have people that have seen something like this before, and they’ve been certainly helpful answering questions for us and guiding us as we run the engineering plant,” he said.
“Right now, our primary mission is to just focus on learning the ship, training, preparing our policy and procedures,” said Lt. D.J. Corbett, the ship’s operations officer.
Corbett said that over the next two months, the Storis will head west, to Kodiak, then through the Bering Sea and north, through the Bering Strait. The ship’s port calls are still being finalized.
Corbett said being aboard an icebreaker means being able to see and do things that no other Coast Guard cutter experiences.
“I still remember the first time that I ever saw ice,” she said. “We were going down south. We had crossed the Antarctic Circle, and all of these massive icebergs just started flowing past us. And then we had right whales that were popping up and coming to see the ship. We had orcas. It was our last sunset. As we were heading south, it would be 24 hours of sunlight. So all of this was happening, the sun was setting, and then we saw a green flash that night. At first, we didn’t believe it. We were like, Did everyone see that? And so it was my moment of, I’m living in a National Geographic special. It was really amazing.”
 The ship’s first captain looks ahead

Kearns, the ship’s first captain, is an officer who started as an enlisted man in 1996 and rose through the ranks, later earning degrees in ship design. He helped design a new class of icebreakers for the Great Lakes and served as the Coast Guard’s liaison to the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet, which patrols the western Pacific.

“Normally, you start off a ship designed by (the question): What capabilities are you trying to achieve? In this case, we need Arctic presence. That was the most important thing. So we’re willing to take some risk or we’re forced into it because our shipbuilding projects are so behind,” he said.
Critically for the ship’s future, he said, is to come up with the equivalent of the ship’s operating manual. Coast Guard officers are trained to run ships, but the Storis is unique.
“What are all the things you need to learn to do the same job on Storis? And then run all of our people through that. … I think success will be when we get all of that documentation done and then get all of our watchstanders what would be considered fully qualified,” he said.
Kerns acknowledged that there are some people who would prefer that the Storis jump quickly into law enforcement, fisheries patrols and search and rescue. He prefers a slower pace.
“We need to learn how to crawl. And that’s what we’re doing, Kerns said.
For example, the crew of the Storis hasn’t yet launched the ship’s small craft, which are stored in bays along the side of the hull, in open water.
“We’ve just started to gain proficiency in launching that in protected, calm seas. So next would be, what does it look like to launch that in open water? And then how do we need to drive the ship from the bridge to create the right conditions to safely launch that boat? And then that would help us build into, ‘Oh, this is how we would  perform Coast Guard mission sets.’”
Asked about the ship’s history, the critical 2014 report and whether he has safety concerns, he said no.
“I have no concerns. I feel totally safe on Storis,” Kerns said.
He said he’s familiar with reporting that analyzed what went wrong with the Aiviq and why it was unable to keep the Kulluk from running aground.
“It easily gets attributed to design flaws for the ship, which is a little bit misleading. In extreme weather, every ship has design flaws. There’s constraints on operations. Ships are designed to operate in certain conditions to a certain extent, and if you operate the ship past those constraints, you’re going to find out what’s going to fail first,” he said.
Some engineering changes were made after the Kulluk accident — the Aiviq’s fuel vents were raised, “which means you can take more water in the vicinity of them before it would down-flood. It’s not that it couldn’t possibly happen again, but it’s less likely.”
Kerns said the “creature comforts” aboard the ship are the most easily noticeable difference from a purpose-built Coast Guard ship.
The Storis has heated handrails, walkways and exterior stairs, a feature intended to eliminate the need for crew to beat ice away as it forms.
“There’s a lot of automation in places that we might not use it, because we use manpower instead,” he said.
Kerns said he’s also been impressed with the ship’s multiple redundancies.
“Almost every system has backups to the backups. They really thought about this thing being in the Arctic and independent and away from logistical support. There’s different ways to make water. There’s ways to handle sewage. I actually feel very comfortable with what the capabilities are,” he said.
“I’m definitely looking forward to doing ice breaking on this thing. It’s a lot of fun to drive,” Kerns said.

(Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)Attorneys representing the University of Alabama (UA) system in a lawsuit challenging Alabama’s 2024 state law banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and so-called “divisive concepts” claimed in court filings that new federal guidance on anti-discrimination laws would make it unlawful for UA to reopen open spaces dedicated to minority students, likening it to “unlawful segregation.”
In a brief filed Tuesday last week, attorneys for the university cited a July memorandum from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, claiming that DEI initiatives can be considered discriminatory and may be in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws.
“The guidance states that it would be an unlawful practice for ‘[a] university’s DEI initiative [to designate] a ‘safe space’ or lounge exclusively for students of a specific racial or ethnic group,’ … and that ‘[e]ven if access is technically open to all, the identity-based focus creates a perception of segregation and may foster a hostile environment’ in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws,” the attorneys wrote, quoting the Trump administration’s guidance.

The lawsuit, brought by professors and students in the University of Alabama system against Gov. Kay Ivey and the university system Board of Trustees, alleges that SB 129 stifled instructional activity and violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The anti-DEI law bans public funding for diversity and inclusion initiatives and the teaching of so-called “divisive concepts,” such as people of one race being “inherently responsible” for past crimes committed by members of that race.
UA professor alleges lawmaker threatened honors program budget over anti-DEI law

In July 2024, ahead of the anti-DEI law’s implementation, the UA system announced it planned to close the schools’ DEI offices and replace them with offices that seemingly addressed similar goals. Later in August, UA closed its Black Student Union and Safe Zone, its LGBTQ+ resource center, citing compliance with SB 129.
UA attorneys wrote that the guidance “speaks directly” to officials’ concerns about reinstating Black Student Union and Safe Zone offices in the UA Student Center; UA’s Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; and UAB’s Student Multicultural and Diversity Programs office.
Attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund and the ACLU of Alabama representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit argued in a filing Monday that the guidance is irrelevant, stating that the memorandum is nothing more than “non-binding suggestions.”
“The fact that the board defendants now believe they could support the closure based on some other law (an argument they did not introduce until after the evidentiary hearing) does not undermine standing or otherwise avoid adjudication of whether the closures pursuant to SB 129 were unconstitutional,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote.
The attorneys also wrote that it was “undisputed” that the Black Student Union and Safe Zone spaces were open to all students and “did not limit use based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.”
“There is not a shred of evidence in the record that either the BSU space or the Safe Zone created a perception of segregation or fostered a hostile environment.  The guidance simply has no application to the case actually before this Court,” plaintiff’s counsel stated.
Plaintiffs said at a two-day evidentiary hearing in June that SB 129 was vaguely written, threatened the teaching of Black history in schools, chilled academic freedom and ultimately led to threats of budget cuts to an honors program from one state representative.
U.S. District Judge David Proctor indicated in June he wanted to decide whether to issue an injunction before the start of the fall semester. Classes start on August 20 at UA and August 25 at UAB.
In briefs filed after hearings in late June and early July, plaintiffs argued that a new law is leading to “viewpoint discrimination,” claiming that professors, fearing enforcement, have to “self-censor” and change their teaching methods. One professor, Dana Patton, testified she was investigated after an anonymous complaint and warned by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, that lawmakers wouldn’t “let this go.”
The Alabama Attorney General’s office, representing Gov. Kay Ivey, argued in their post-hearing brief that these fears aren’t “objectively reasonable” since the professors stated they don’t intend to violate the law. Attorneys for the UA Board, argued that classroom speech is “government speech,” not private speech, and that the University of Alabama has the right to “reasonably control the content of their curriculum.”
Student plaintiffs also claim the law caused their organizations to lose funding and campus spaces. The defendants counter that some of these injuries are “monetary” and that, in certain cases, students chose not to apply for available funding.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tuscaloosa_McLelland16755-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 16:57:03.926001

The whole community owes profound thanks to the activists who have exposed the plight of people who are being forcibly removed from Vermont by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
It is welcome news that the Burlington airport’s director of aviation, Nic Longo, and Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak are seeking ways to ensure that everyone who is being moved through our airport has access to legal assistance. We can be proud that Gov. Phil Scott reportedly has said that his administration will support efforts to ensure that everyone detained in our state is treated fairly and afforded due process under the law.

As the author of a book on the Dutch resistance, I know the public officials we honor today are not those who said they couldn’t do anything about the deportations. Instead, they are the ones who looked for every possible method they might use to slow the monstrous mechanism down even a little. 
Now it’s up to Vermont to treat people as we would wish to be treated — whether by asking every person whether they are flying of their own free will, making sure they have access to an attorney, enforcing parking policies for ICE vehicles, requiring that public doorways be used or other ways we haven’t imagined yet.  
This is your chance to do what you think you would have done in World War II. Let Scott, Mulvaney-Stanak and Longo know the community is behind them in doing the right thing.

Dillon’s work also figures indirectly in a modern-day lesson on how NOT to run a government.
This how-not-to-do-it tutorial occurred last week during a Jones County Board of Supervisors meeting. A similar lesson is playing out in Storm Lake to a growing audience of discontented residents there.
At the heart of this lesson is the simple command the Legislature adopted 50 years ago — that public business should take place in the open for all to see, not in secret. Lawmakers and the courts recognize that voters and taxpayers cannot understand and evaluate the basis and rationale for government decisions when elected leaders make them behind closed doors or based on undisclosed information.
But some officials trip over themselves to avoid the heat of the spotlight when considering controversial topics. It is not necessarily a desire to avoid controversies. Instead, some prefer to discuss and decide what to do in private for convenience or to avoid embarrassment.
How does Lyman Dillon, an obscure pioneer, figure into this issue of openness vs. secrecy? Let’s begin with a quick history lesson.
In 1839, the federal government hired the 39-year-old farmer from Cascade to construct the first road in the Iowa Territory. I use the term “construct” loosely. Dillon was paid $3 per mile to use his teams of oxen to plow a 90-mile-long path that would guide travelers between Dubuque and Iowa City.
The path was officially known as the Military Road. Unofficially, people called it Dillon’s Furrow. Today, his path carries mundane names, U.S. Highway 151 between Dubuque and Anamosa and Iowa Highway 1 from just west of Anamosa to Iowa City.
In 1887, the government built an iron bridge over the Wapsipinicon River at Anamosa to further aid travelers using Dillon’s Furrow. That bridge still stands, although it no longer carries travelers.
Some people in eastern Iowa, including the Anamosa City Council and 1,200 petition signers, want to preserve what is now called the Dillon Military Bridge as a historic centerpiece for a recreational hiking and biking trail. But members of the Jones County Board of Supervisors see the bridge as a big expense for taxpayers and want to cut it up for scrap.
I do not have a position on the keep-or-scrap question. But I do have an opinion on the process the county supervisors followed last week.
The board disregarded the spirit and letter of Iowa’s public meetings Iowa when it met behind closed doors to discuss the bridge question and the county’s Anamosa bridge agreement. When the public meeting resumed, the supervisors came down in favor of demolition and voted to dissolve their agreement with Anamosa.
They did this without allowing preservationists to observe or comment during the supervisors’ deliberations last week. In contrast, when the bridge issue came before the Anamosa City Council in June, about 70 people attended and spoke at length.
County Attorney Kristofer Lyons said the supervisors needed to close their meeting  because the bridge issue could end up in a lawsuit. Following his logic, government boards in Iowa could debate nearly every controversial issue in secret because there always is a chance someone might sue.
The litigation exemption to the public meetings law allows government boards and their lawyers to discuss legal strategy in a pending lawsuit or in a dispute that is headed to the courts. Neither applies at this point to the Dillon Military Bridge dispute.
As in Jones County, people in Storm Lake are frustrated by the lack of information about the financial health of King’s Pointe Resort, a hotel, resort and water park on the shore of Storm Lake. The city owns the property and contracts with an outside management company to run it.
Questions about the profitability of King’s Pointe arose when the latest city audit was made public. It reported the resort’s cash on hand has fallen by half in recent years. Expenses exceeded revenues in 2024, 2023, 2021 and 2020, the Storm Lake Times Pilot reported.
To answer the public’s questions about the resort finances, the newspaper asked for copies of the monthly profit and loss statements the management company must provide to city officials under their operating agreement. The city claimed those statements do not exist, and if they did, the Times Pilot or anyone else asking for them would have to pay a city fee to retrieve and copy the documents.
The Times Pilot wrote an editorial last week titled, “Fortress of secrecy.” The editorial said, “Storm Lake City Hall is stonewalling us so hard on basic public information it makes one think that an attempt is being made to obscure poor management.”
The editorial continued: “Government should not operate this way, but we have become accustomed to it. Secrecy has become official policy.”
But it should not be, not in Storm Lake, nor in Jones County. Not for bridges, nor for water slides and hotels.

,California,2025-08-11 19:36:23+00:00,CalMatters,2.300 ‘Dreamers’ de California están a punto de perder su cobertura médica,Ana B. Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2025/08/dreamers-perder-cobertura-medica/,La administración Trump revirtió una regla que permitía a los inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron traídos a los EE. UU. cuando eran niños comprar seguros de salud en los mercados de la Ley de Atención Médica Asequible.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Menos de un año después de que a los “Dreamers” se les permitió por primera vez inscribirse en el seguro de salud de Covered California, los inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron traídos a los EE. UU. cuando eran niños están a punto de perder su cobertura médica.
 En California, esto significa que unos 2300 Dreamers deben buscar seguro médico en otro lugar o quedarse sin él una vez que su cobertura finalice a fin de mes. La decisión fue tomada por los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid (CDS) federales, la agencia que supervisa los mercados de seguros.
El año pasado, la administración Biden actualizó la definición de “presente legalmente” para la Ley de Atención Médica Asequible  (ACA), de modo que los beneficiarios del programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA), también conocidos como Dreamers, pudieran adquirir seguros a través de los mercados estatales y federales. La administración Trump revocó esa decisión en junio y fijó la entrada en vigor del cambio dos meses después.
La orden está “diseñada para estabilizar el grupo de riesgos, reducir las primas y reducir las inscripciones indebidas con el objetivo de mejorar la asequibilidad y el acceso a la atención médica, manteniendo al mismo tiempo la responsabilidad fiscal”, dijo la agencia en un comunicado anunciando los cambios en el mercado.
 La semana pasada, Covered California anunció que estaba trabajando para notificar a todos los beneficiarios de DACA que su último día de cobertura será el 31 de agosto y que les ayudará a explorar otras opciones de seguro.
 Desde su creación, la Ley de Atención Médica Asequible ha prohibido a los inmigrantes que residen ilegalmente en el país adquirir cobertura médica en el mercado de seguros médicos. Los beneficiarios de DACA, a quienes se les permite permanecer y trabajar legalmente en Estados Unidos gracias a un programa de 2012, se convirtieron en la excepción. 
 ‘Esperaba un resultado diferente’
 “Esta decisión es profundamente injusta para las personas trabajadoras y contribuyentes de California que confiaban en tener seguro médico para 2025, solo para que se lo quitaran ocho meses después”, declaró Jessica Altman, directora ejecutiva de Covered California. “Si bien esperábamos un resultado diferente para los beneficiarios de DACA, debemos cumplir con la ley federal”.
Sin el mercado de seguros, los Dreamers tendrán que buscar cobertura a través de un empleador o, si sus ingresos son lo suficientemente bajos, podrían calificar para Medi-Cal, el programa estatal de seguro médico para personas de bajos ingresos . Esto deja algunos Dreamers f en una situación difícil si ganan demasiado para calificar para Medi-Cal, pero no lo suficiente para pagar el precio completo de un plan de salud.
 El beneficio de inscribirse en un seguro a través de Covered California es acceder a asistencia financiera. Se estima que ampliar la cobertura a los beneficiarios de DACA en todo el país le costaría al gobierno federal entre $240 y $300 millones al año . 
 Efecto en el mercado
 Si bien el gobierno federal dijo que los recortes tienen como objetivo estabilizar el grupo de riesgos del seguro y ayudar a reducir las primas, los expertos dicen que eliminar la cobertura para los jóvenes (la mayoría de los Dreamers tienen menos de 36 años ) haría lo contrario.
 Esto se debe a que cuando las personas más jóvenes y saludables se inscriben en un seguro, su cobertura de bajo costo ayuda a equilibrar el alto costo de cubrir a individuos que están más enfermos y mayores, dijo Arturo Vargas Bustamante, profesor de la Escuela de Salud Pública Fielding de UCLA.
 Así que, cuando menos jóvenes se inscriben en la cobertura, las primas tienden a subir para todos. “Entonces, las personas enfermas que realmente necesitan cobertura pagan el precio”, dijo Vargas Bustamante.
 El programa DACA, vigente desde hace 13 años, no otorga estatus legal a sus beneficiarios, pero sí los protege de la deportación y les otorga autorización de trabajo. Se estima que más de 150,000 beneficiarios de DACA viven en California.
 La decisión del presidente Joe Biden de asegurar a los beneficiarios de DACA a través de los mercados de seguros se topó inmediatamente con la resistencia de los estados republicanos. El verano pasado, un grupo de 19 fiscales generales republicanos presentó una demanda en un tribunal federal para intentar detener la expansión del mercado de seguros a los beneficiarios de DACA. Un juez federal de Dakota del Norte falló a favor de los demandantes e impidió que la norma entrara en vigor en esos 19 estados. La nueva norma de los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid se aplica a todos los estados.
 Los beneficiarios de DACA son el primer grupo de un gran número de inmigrantes que se espera que pierdan o abandonen pronto la cobertura del mercado de seguros. El presupuesto federal que el presidente Donald Trump aprobó el mes pasado elimina la asistencia financiera del mercado para algunos grupos de inmigrantes legalmente presentes, como refugiados y asilados, a partir de 2027. Sin asistencia financiera, muchos de estos beneficiarios probablemente no podrán costear su cobertura.
 Mientras tanto, todos los demás inscritos en un plan de Covered California podrían ver sus primas mensuales aumentar en $101 por mes a partir del próximo año.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/012825_Dreamers-LA_AJ_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 15:57:25.835908

Roger Nutt, R-Moore, resigned his seat Monday in the Senate chamber, as seen in session Wednesday, March 23, 2022. (Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — State Sen. Roger Nutt resigned his Upstate seat Monday after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, the Moore Republican said in a news release.
Rep. Bobby Cox, a Greer Republican, has announced he will run for Nutt’s seat representing parts of Spartanburg and Greenville counties. To do so, Cox also resigned Monday from his House seat.
Nutt, a 59-year-old father of three, spent a decade on the Spartanburg County Council before winning a seat in the House in the 2020 election. He was elected to the Senate last November after emerging as the victor of a contentious, four-way GOP primary for an open seat.

Nutt had been receiving medical treatment for what he believed were symptoms of long COVID, in which symptoms of the virus linger after the infection itself has ended. Doctors instead determined that Nutt had neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer’s disease, according to a news release.
“While we are saddened by this news, we will face this trial with faith in the grace of God that has sustained our lives, our marriage and my career in public service for nearly 15 years,” Nutt said in a statement.
Following the resignation, the Senate set the dates of an election to fill Nutt’s seat, as per the timing rules in state law: Filing will open Aug. 29 for party primaries (if needed) Oct. 21. A general election will be Dec. 23.
Voters sent Nutt to the Senate to replace Sen. Scott Talley of Spartanburg, who opted not to seek a third term.
Nutt said Talley asked him to run, but others wanting the seat included former Sen. Lee Bright, a firebrand Republican who lost his reelection bid to Talley in 2016.
Bright placed first in the four-way primary last June, but Nutt ultimately defeated Bright in the runoff by fewer than 150 votes.
While in the House, Nutt voted with the Freedom Caucus much of the time, but he didn’t want to join the ultra-conservative group that split off from the main Republican Caucus out of fear of limiting his options, he said ahead of last year’s primary runoff.
During this year’s session in the Senate, Nutt sponsored a bill that would allow nursing home residents to select one person allowed to continue visiting in case of an emergency, such as another pandemic. Even in South Carolina, COVID-19 rules kept loved ones locked out from nursing homes for more than a year.
The bill passed the Senate but didn’t get a hearing in the House — at least, not this year. Legislators can still take it up after returning to the Statehouse in January.
“It is hard to describe how much I have enjoyed my time in the Senate,” Nutt wrote in his letter. “Serving in the Senate has been a dream come true, and I am so proud to be a small part of this great Body.”
Nutt encouraged Cox to run as his replacement, Cox wrote in a Facebook post Monday. The election for Cox’s seat will take place at the same time as the special election for Nutt’s seat.
It will also be the same day voters in Lexington County replace Rep. RJ May. Though written last Thursday, May’s resignation was received Monday from jail, where he’s being held without bond on charges of distributing child sexual abuse material.
Cox, first elected to the House in 2018, said he resigned the same day as Nutt to prevent the cost of multiple special elections.
“This decision will save taxpayer dollars, ensure the people of Greenville and Spartanburg Counties are not without representation for months in 2026, and allow me to fully dedicate myself to earning the trust of the voters for this next chapter of service,” Cox wrote.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1276-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 15:57:25.835908

(Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife)A coalition of outdoor sporting groups intend to appeal the decision of a federal judge in Montana made last week that directed the federal government to reconsider whether gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains require additional protections under the Endangered Species Act.
The Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, Safari Club International and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation on Wednesday submitted their notice to appeal the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy of Montana to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
“This ruling is the latest string of nonstop litigation by environmental groups seeking to frustrate the original intent of the ESA, which is to recover endangered species and return them to state-based management, not keep them perpetually listed and under the authority of the federal government,” Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation President and CEO Kyle Weaver said in a press release. “Whether it’s the wolf or the grizzly bear, once an animal receives ESA protections, it becomes nearly impossible to remove them, even if populations meet recovery criteria over an extended period of time. The ESA needs an adjustment to renew its focus on real species recovery.”
In last Tuesday’s ruling, Molloy vacated a 2024 determination made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that gray wolves in the Western United States do not need increased federal protections.
Currently, gray wolves are listed as an endangered species in the contiguous 48 states, except in the Northern Rockies — Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Oregon and Washington — after management of the species in those regions was given over to the states following Congressional action in 2011.
 Conservationists argued in lawsuit that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess wolf populations

A coalition of more than 70 environmental and conservation organizations submitted a petition to the federal government in 2021, asking the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist gray wolves in the Northern Rockies, or create a western Distinct Population Segment, or DPS, for the species with added protections.
The coalition argued in its petition, and subsequent lawsuit following the Fish and Wildlife Service’s determination against added protections, that due to concerns that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess population statistics, harsh political rhetoric and increased mandates in Montana and Idaho to reduce wolf populations, and because wolves do not inhabit the full extent of their historic range — which once broadly comprised the entire western U.S — the species meets the criteria for reconsideration under the Endangered Species Act.
“Management of Canis lupus must not be by a political yo-yo process,” Molloy wrote, adding that the federal government had “failed to use the best available science” in its species analysis.
Molloy’s ruling requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to reevaluate whether gray wolves should receive increased federal protections.
 Montana state officials disagree with federal judge’s wolf ruling

While members of the conservation coalition praised last Tuesday’s decision, officials in Montana, which joined the lawsuit as an intervenor-defendant, and Idaho, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of the federal government, disagreed with the ruling by an “activist judge.”
“Montana has a healthy, sustainable population of wolves. While we are reviewing the decision, it will not implicate our state’s management efforts or our wolf season,” said Kaitlin Price, a spokesperson for Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office. “Unfortunately, we’re not surprised to see another activist decision in favor of environmental extremists.”
Price said that if the Fish and Wildlife Service appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks “will be there to support them.”
Price could not be reached before publication about whether the state and Fish, Wildlife and Parks would sign on to the current notice of appeal.
“We’re extremely disappointed with the decision considering Idaho has managed a wolf population above federal recovery goals for decades and sustained more-than-adequate wolf populations since Congress removed them from Endangered Species Act protection in 2011,” Idaho Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement.
Molloy’s ruling does not currently change the status of gray wolves, which are managed by each state’s respective wildlife agency.
In Montana, where gray wolves number approximately 1,100, Fish, Wildlife and Parks has proposed new hunting and trapping regulations for the upcoming wolf season that would set a statewide quota of 500 animals — up from 334 in 2024 — and would significantly increase bag limits allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license, for up to 30 total wolves.
Arguments from the coalition in support of its appeal are expected to be filed soon, according to Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation staff.
“We had to appeal this decision,” Michael Jean, litigation counsel for Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, said in a press statement. “This decision seems to hold that unless a species is not recovered across its entire historical range, then it has to stay listed — regardless of thriving populations. It’s difficult to see how the wolf, or other listed species, will ever be deemed recovered under that standard.”

National Guard, pledges similar crackdown in Democratic cities","Ariana Figueroa, Jacob Fischler",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-mobilizes-dc-national-guard-pledges-similar-crackdown-democratic-cities,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump asserted control Monday of the District of Columbia police force and mobilized 800 National Guard troops in the nation’s capital under what he declared a ""crime emergency.""Trump took the step despite a three-decade low in violent crime in Washington, D.C., while warning he may pursue similar action in other Democratic-led cities that he sees as having “totally out of control” crime.Trump at a press conference said that he hopes other Democratic-led cities are watching because Monday’s actions in the district are just the beginning.“We’re starting very strongly with D.C.,” Trump said.The president placed the Metropolitan Police Department of roughly 3,400 officers under federal control, citing the district’s Home Rule Act that allows for the federal takeover until an emergency is declared over, or 30 days after the declaration. Congress can also authorize the extension.“We’re going to take our capital back,” Trump said.The mayor of the district, Muriel Bowser, called Monday’s action ""unsettling and unprecedented.” She added that she was not informed by the president that the district’s police force would be taken over.DOGE staffer hurtThe escalation of federal control came after a former U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, official was injured in an attempted carjacking incident around 3 a.m. Eastern near the district neighborhood of Logan Circle. Two Maryland teenagers were arrested on charges of unarmed carjacking in connection with the incident.The president said he is prepared to send in more National Guard “if needed,” and that he will handle the city the same way he has handled immigration at the southern border. The Trump administration has been carrying out a campaign of mass deportations.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the press conference that members of the National Guard will be “flowing into” the district sometime this week.Local officials in the district protested Trump’s move. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, an elected official, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the Trump administration’s “actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.”“There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year,” Schwalb said.“We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents,” he continued.Trump at the press conference said that he’s also directed officials to clear out encampments of homeless people in the district, but did not detail where those people would be moved.Hundreds of federal law enforcement officers, representing agencies from the Drug Enforcement Agency to the Interior Department, were deployed across the city Saturday and Sunday.Los Angeles and beyondThe president’s crackdown in the district occurred after a federal appeals court this summer temporarily approved Trump’s move to take control of the California National Guard from Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom for the purpose of quelling protests over the administration's aggressive immigration raids.The president Monday slammed several major Democratic cities – Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – and inaccurately claimed they had the highest murder rates. Trump said that he hopes other cities are “watching us today.”“Maybe they’ll self clean up and maybe they'll self do this and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all of the things that caused the problem,” the president said.Trump pointed at Chicago, criticizing Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker.“I understand he wants to be president,” Trump said of Pritzker, before taking a shot at the governor's personal appearance. “I noticed he lost a little weight so maybe he has a chance.”Pritzker is hosting Texas Democrats who left the state to prevent the state legislature from having a quorum after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session in order to redistrict the state to give more seats to Republicans in Congress.GOP applauds The top Republican on the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has jurisdiction over the district, praised Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard and take over the police department.“President Trump is rightly using executive power to take bold and necessary action to crack down on crime and restore law and order in Washington, D.C.,” Rep. James Comer, Republican of Kentucky, said in a statement.Comer added that the committee next month will hold a hearing with Schwalb, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Mayor Muriel Bowser.While state governors have control over their National Guards, the president has control over the National Guard members in the district. The National Guard does not have arresting authority, under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.During Trump’s first term, he deployed roughly 5,000 National Guard on Black Lives Matter protesters in the district after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.And despite requests from congressional leaders, Trump notably delayed activating National Guard members during the 2021 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol, when the president's supporters tried to subvert the certification of the 2020 presidential election.In one of Trump’s first actions on his inauguration day in January, he pardoned hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters who were charged by the Department of Justice for their involvement in the insurrection.Putin meetingIn a question-and-answer session after announcing the National Guard deployment, Trump told reporters he hoped his meeting this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin would help put that country on a path to peace with Ukraine, which he said would involve each country ceding some territory to the other.Trump described the Friday summit in Alaska — Putin’s first visit to the U.S. in a decade — as a “feel-out meeting.”Asked if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was invited to the summit, Trump said he was “not part of it.” Any framework for peace discussed between Trump and Putin would be relayed to Zelenskyy, he said.An end to the war would have to come from direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, which may or may not ultimately involve the U.S., he said.“I’m going to put the two of them in a room, and I’ll be there or I won’t be there, and I think it’ll get solved,” he said of Putin and Zelenskyy.Trump said he was “a little disappointed” that Zelenskyy did not immediately agree to cede territory to Russia, which invaded his country in February 2022. Zelenskyy has repeatedly said giving land to Russia was a nonstarter, including after Trump suggested it over the weekend.“Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,” Zelenskyy said in a video address Saturday, according to The New York Times.",,,,2025-08-11 15:57:25.835908

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

Price said that if FWS appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks “will be there to support them.”
Price could not be reached before publication about whether the state and FWP would sign on to the current notice of appeal.
“We’re extremely disappointed with the decision considering Idaho has managed a wolf population above federal recovery goals for decades and sustained more-than-adequate wolf populations since Congress removed them from Endangered Species Act protection in 2011,” Idaho Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement.
Molloy’s ruling does not currently change the status of gray wolves, which are managed by each state’s respective wildlife agency.
In Montana, where gray wolves number approximately 1,100, FWP has proposed new hunting and trapping regulations for the upcoming wolf season that would set a statewide quota of 500 animals — up from 334 in 2024 — and would significantly increase bag limits allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license, for up to 30 total wolves.
Arguments from the coalition in support of its appeal are expected to be filed soon, according to Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation staff.
“We had to appeal this decision,” Michael Jean, litigation counsel for Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, said in a press statement. “This decision seems to hold that unless a species is not recovered across its entire historical range, then it has to stay listed — regardless of thriving populations. It’s difficult to see how the wolf, or other listed species, will ever be deemed recovered under that standard.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)LOUISVILLE — Ford Motor Company will invest nearly $2 billion to convert a longtime auto manufacturing plant in Louisville to build electric vehicles from a new platform adaptable to multiple vehicle types, aiming to launch a mid-sized EV pickup truck by 2027. 
Ford President and CEO Jim Farley told an audience of plant workers, local and state elected officials and other representatives Monday inside the Louisville Assembly Plant that moving forward with the  “universal” EV platform was a risk, especially with global EV competition, but the company was investing in the future. 
“We needed a rapid approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle that delights customers in every way that matters,” Farley said. “We need to do it and be sustainable and make money, and we need to do it with American workers.” 
Farley and other Ford executives said the EV truck would be priced starting at $30,000, would have an “amazing range” and be built through a newly designed assembly line to be created at the Louisville plant. The EV batteries for the new platform will be supplied from a Michigan battery plant. The new truck will have 20% fewer parts compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, allowing for significantly quicker assembly line production. The more efficient assembly line for electric vehicles, these executives said, would also mean less physical strain workers and less getting in and out of vehicles.  
Farley was joined on stage by Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who lauded the “massive investment” in the state. A release from Beshear’s office states Ford’s plant conversion would be the third largest economic development project in Kentucky’s history.

“This cutting-edge platform will be the foundation for the next generation of vehicles. The best part is, these vehicles will be affordable,” Beshear said. “They’re going to help so many American families keep more money in their pockets for groceries, medicine, school supplies and yes, even that family vacation.” 
Leaders with United Auto Workers Local 862, representing workers at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant and Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville said the newly designed assembly line for electric vehicles would cause some plant workers to lose their jobs in Louisville and have to take jobs at another Ford operation. The Louisville Assembly Plant currently builds two SUVs, the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.
“It’s not nearly as drastic as they expected when they first came at us talking about an EV,” said Brandon Reisinger, the Louisville Assembly Plant building chair for the union. “I don’t foresee anybody hitting the street at all. I don’t know that our working number will be exactly the same it is now, but nobody’s gonna get laid off.” 
  Brandon Reisinger with United Auto Workers Local 862 said he believed the low cost of charging electric vehicles can be convincing to consumers. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
Reisinger told reporters some of the work done elsewhere to preassemble cars before they arrive at the plant will be done at the plant with the new EV, offsetting the downsizing. He estimates the plant’s workforce will be about a couple hundred fewer people when the plant conversation is complete, also accounting for people who retire. Ford executives said 2,200 jobs at the plant will be “secured” with the conversion; about 3,300 workers are employed at the plant as of 2024, according to Ford. 
Reisinger said he believes the conversion could begin at the end of the year with some workers temporarily unemployed during a few months of the conversion, but the union’s contract provides for supplemental unemployment benefits to workers worth about 80% of a paycheck. 
When asked about political headwinds against electric vehicles from elected officials in the federal and state governments Reisinger pointed to the lower cost of charging an EV compared to filling up a gas tank as a compelling reason for EVs. 
“I’m going to end up buying me one of these as well when we start building,” Reisinger said. “It’s going to be a very cost-effective vehicle to drive.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1740-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 14:57:07.228887

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A convicted killer incarcerated for more than half a century lost his bid for freedom Monday after the New Jersey Supreme Court rejected his argument that his continued incarceration is unconstitutional under the state’s shifting parole law.
Fred Krug, 78, challenged the state parole board’s 2023 denial of his request for release, citing state and federal constitutional protections — known as ex post facto rights — that prohibit authorities from prolonging punishment by applying new laws to old offenses.
But the state’s top court, in a 6-1 decision, ruled that while state legislators widened parole access in 1979, they restricted it again in 1997 — and the 1997 restrictions were similar to the 1948 parole law that was in place when Krug committed his offenses.
“The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that the ex post facto analysis is concerned ‘solely with whether a statute assigns more disadvantageous criminal or penal consequences to an act than did the law in place when the act occurred.’ That remains true when it comes to changes in parole laws,” Justice Rachel Wainer Apter wrote for the majority. “There is simply no ex post facto problem in retroactively applying to a person the same parole regime that existed at the time he committed his offense.”
The state Office of the Public Defender represented Krug. Joseph J. Russo, an assistant public defender who heads the office’s parole revocation and resentencing unit, called Monday’s decision disappointing.
“For nearly two decades, Mr. Krug’s parole eligibility was governed by the 1979 Parole Act. The majority’s ruling disregards well-established constitutional protections and allows the Parole Board to change the rules long after individuals have relied on them to guide their conduct and plan for release,” Russo said in a statement.
Krug was convicted in 1974 and sentenced to life imprisonment for killing a schoolteacher in East Brunswick, assaulting another woman, and punching a police officer in 1973, all while he was on parole for previous convictions of rape, aggravated assault, and larceny, among other offenses, according to the ruling.
He applied five times for parole between 1994 and 2022, with the board denying him every time, the decision notes. In 2023, the board cited multiple reasons for their denial, including finding a likelihood that he would commit a new crime if paroled.
After his fifth rejection, he appealed, pinning his plea to legislative changes made in 1979 that created a presumption of release for parole applicants.
Before 1979, people angling to get out of New Jersey’s prisons were bound by the Parole Act of 1948. That act allowed the board to review “all existing available records” in determining whether to grant or deny parole.
In 1979, lawmakers repealed the 1948 law and replaced it with a law that largely barred the board from denying parole unless it had “new information” that justified continued confinement. Lawmakers tweaked that law again in 1997, removing the new information requirement and allowing the board to again consider an applicant’s entire record.
Krug had argued that the 1997 amendments subjected him to harsher penalties than he faced under the 1979 law, making his denial unconstitutional under ex post facto protections. He criticized the board’s “shifting position” relating to the many legislative changes, saying it “essentially asserts that it gets to pick and choose which Parole Act applies to a (pre-1997) inmate based on whichever Act makes it easiest to deny parole.”
Justice Michael Noriega, the lone dissenter, objected to the parole board resurrecting the repealed 1948 law to justify Krug’s continued incarceration, saying the board “creates a legal fiction that the 1979 Act never existed.”
The 1979 law was enacted with retroactive effect and set the expectations under which Krug served his sentence and sought parole, Noriega wrote.
“Then, in 1997, the State enacted new parole provisions that imposed more restrictive conditions that created a substantial risk of prolonged incarceration. In 2022, the Parole Board applied those stricter standards and denied Krug parole. The Ex Post Facto Clause was specifically designed to forbid and prevent such maneuvering,” Noriega wrote.
The court’s majority disagreed.
“Because the law at the time of Krug’s offenses permitted the Board to consider the same ‘all existing’ information it may now consider, we hold that retroactive application of the 1997 amendment to Krug created no risk of additional punishment,” Wainer Apter wrote.
Wainer Apter noted, though, that the majority decision does not address “whether the facts of this case, or any case involving a change in law that conferred a benefit on an inmate for many years, and then subsequently repealed that benefit, could implicate due process or fundamental fairness concerns.”
Monday’s ruling comes after multiple reports in recent years have dinged the parole board for its low release rates. The board has for years freed less than half of parole-eligible applicants, prompting calls for reform.

The private equity firm Thor Equities is leading the development efforts. Advocates say the firm plans to invest roughly a billion dollars in the project, which they say could eventually net the township and local schools multi-million dollar tax revenues.
The group of petitioning residents,  “Protect Augusta Township”,  started their campaign after the township board in July unanimously approved rezoning 522 acres of land from “agricultural residential” to “general industrial” use at Thor’s request.
At recent township board and planning commission meetings, dozens of local residents have voiced concerns that the data center could be a noisy, energy-intensive eyesore that permanently alters the landscape and local culture. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Data centers house vast arrays of computer equipment used to store digital information. They power internet services and use massive amounts of water and electricity. A Thor spokesperson told MLive the facility in Augusta township would use more than a million gallons of water per day.
“There hasn’t been major business in this community. It’s been farmland,” resident and signature-gatherer Travis Matts said. “To know that on the horizon, major development is creeping its way towards us is just kind of nerve-wracking.”
In some communities with data centers, locals have complained about the noise. Eileen Cosner is an Augusta Township resident. She’s concerned that people, pets and livestock will have to put up with the constant hum of data center cooling fans, periodic generator use, and noise during the data center’s construction.
According to MLive, Thor wants to purchase a total of 810 acres currently zoned as industrial and build the data center on about 20% of that land, leaving other areas undeveloped to act as a visual and sonic buffer between the data center and its residential neighbors.
 Cosner doesn’t trust Thor to only build on a small portion of the land it acquires.
“[I’m] pretty sure that once they buy it, they will build all the way down.”

Phil Santer is the chief of staff at Ann Arbor SPARK, a public-private nonprofit economic development organization that supports the data center development. Santer says once the data center is built it would be relatively unobtrusive. He says Thor has committed to abiding by the township’s noise ordinance, and that its planned billion dollar investment will provide roughly six million dollars in new annual tax revenue for the local school district, with additional revenue for township government.
“When I view an opportunity like a data center, what I see is highly impactful, in terms of value creation, but low impact in terms of what it actually means for the community,” Santer said. “These are going to generate a significant amount of taxes that will benefit the entire region.”
Augusta Township Trustee Keith Gipfert says he had concerns about the data center’s intensive energy demands until he met with DTE Energy and the Ypsilanti Community Utilities Authority, the local water utility. He said both assured him there is adequate supply. He says the potential tax revenue from the data center would be useful for maintaining aging bridges the township would otherwise struggle to pay for.
Matts feels township trustees pushed the zoning changes through too quickly. As he’s been gathering petition signatures, he says many residents are unaware of the project.
“Having gone door to door now for the past week canvassing, a lot of the folks in our community are completely unaware that the data center is being proposed at all,” Matts said.
The proposal is still in the early stages. The formal site review process has not yet begun and it is uncertain what company or companies may contract with Thor once the facility begins operations.
The referendum petition campaign, if successful, would give residents a chance to vote on Thor’s rezoning request themselves.
Why a data center and why in August Township?
As tech companies and governments around the world race to develop leading artificial intelligence tools, global demand for electricity to power data centers is projected to increase vastly.
Alongside private equity firms like Thor, tech companies including Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta, are collectively investing hundreds of billions of dollars in data center development. The U.S. Department of Energy has announced plans to establish public-private partnerships to begin operating data centers on department-owned land by 2027.
The International Energy Agency in an April report projected that electricity demand for data centers worldwide is expected to more than double by 2030. The report says “AI will be the most significant driver of this increase,” with electricity demand from AI-optimized data centers projected to more than quadruple by 2030. Goldman Sachs in February forecast a 165% increase in global electricity demand for data centers by 2030.
Santer says that in Michigan, larger data center developments became more economically feasible after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed significant tax exemptions for data centers into law last year. He says the Augusta Township site meets the three main requirements for successful data center development: power supply, water supply, and land in proximity to power transmission lines.
“So now, as a confluence of all those different factors, we’ve got opportunities to try and land some of these things in our community,” Santer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 14:57:07.228887

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
Missouri lawmakers have debated a similar ban for several years, but it has yet to win legislative approval.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 
Public health concerns
 


Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.
“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 8 had burned more than 100,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
By that time it was already Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 106,672 acres with 6% containment as of Aug. 10. It’s believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, is also believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,635 as of Aug. 8, and is 9% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 49% contained and has burned an estimated 28,403 acres since it was started by lightning on July 10.

Gov. Jared Polis recently issued disaster declarations for fires in Delta, Mesa, Montrose and Rio Blanco counties. On Aug. 6, he mobilized the Colorado National Guard to support firefighting efforts on the Lee and Elk fires.
Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm


















High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

HOST: Paul Hattis & John McDonough
GUEST: Eric Dickson, president and CEO of UMass Memorial Health







THE BAY STATE is already struggling with a primary care provider crisis, and the head of the largest not-for-profit health care system in Central Massachusetts sees an increasingly grim road ahead if current trends persist. 
This week on the monthly Health or Consequences episode of The Codcast, John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute spoke with Eric Dickson, president and CEO of UMass Memorial Health. 
“It pains me, especially as an emergency physician, to look at the trajectory of some of the key metrics and health care in this state,” Dickson said.  
Massachusetts now has the third longest ER wait times in country, which Dickson said is a reflection of a decline in primary care access.  
“Primary care is the foundation of any good health care system, on a national or state level or regional basis,” he said. “So you don’t have primary care. Patients can’t get seen early. They end up in the emergency department later, in the course of their disease, which explains a lot about why healthcare costs so much in the state of Massachusetts.” 
Medical universities are struggling to produce enough physicians to keep up with the need, he said.  
UMass Chan is one of only two New England medical schools to rank in the top 10 percentile for primary care education, he noted. But students attending the school – where Dickson himself studied medicine – are now paying far more than he did, or doing the math and concluding that working in primary care and paying back loans to cover $70,000 a year in out-of-state tuition is unmanageable. 
And federal headwinds are not helping the broader health landscape, he said. For hospitals that have a large number of patients on Medicaid, like UMass Memorial, they will be greatly impacted” by the coming cuts to Medicaid signed into law on July 4 by President Trump in the sweeping tax and spend bill. 
But the scale of damage is still hard to pin down, Dickson said, because new work requirements for Medicaid recipients will go into effect in October 2026 and take some unknown number of people off of their coverage. Plus the new federal posture on vaccinations from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long history of vaccine skepticism and is rolling back recommendations and research into vaccinations, will likely lead to resurgences in long-forgotten diseases, Dickson said. 
“This will become a nation of people with chronic disease,” he said. “And as the population, ages and medications get better to keep people alive longer, it’s a little bit scary to think about the shortage of primary care that exists today, and how bad that will be 10 years from now, if something doesn’t change.” 
On the episode, Dickson discusses the primary care crisis (03:10), the looming Medicaid cuts and National Institutes of Health funding cuts (07:20), and the consolidation of medical providers in Massachusetts (18:00).

(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Rep. RJ May has resigned his House seat two months after his arrest on charges of distributing child sexual abuse material, according to a letter the House Speaker’s Office received Monday.
The West Columbia Republican, who remains in jail without bond, has been suspended from the House without pay since his June arrest, as is required by state law for any public official indicted on a felony. He was also the subject of a House Ethics Commission investigation, which would have been the first step toward expelling him from the House.
“I have decided that it is in the best interest of my family and constituents to resign immediately from the South Carolina House of Representatives,” May wrote in his letter, dated Thursday. “Please accept this letter as my formal resignation from the South Carolina House of Representatives.”

copier@scstatehouse.gov_20250811_113331 
“It has been an honor to serve the people of District 88,” the three-sentence letter concluded.
As required by law, the election for May’s seat is expected to take place Dec. 23, the month before the legislative session begins. Filing would open Aug. 29, with a primary election taking place Oct. 21, according to the State Election Commission.
The office of House Speaker Murrell Smith must still officially set the dates.
House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, R-Pickens, said he expected the ethics complaint he had filed against May to end, since May is no longer a member of the House.
Rep. Jordan Pace, a Goose Creek Republican and Freedom Caucus chairman, said he welcomed May’s resignation and had hoped the House would have already expelled him. May was a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and acted as its de facto spokesman until the investigation into him became public.
“Our hearts are with his victims and his innocent family, and we pray for swift justice as this ugly chapter in the South Carolina House of Representatives comes to a close,” the Freedom Caucus said in a statement.

The investigation into May began in April 2024, when social messaging app Kik notified a federal nonprofit that videos involving child sexual abuse had been sent from an account called “joebidennnn69.”
Federal investigators tracked the account, which had saved 220 different videos and images depicting child sexual abuse, to May’s house and cellphone, prosecutors said during a June detention hearing.
An attorney for May argued that someone had hacked into his accounts and targeted the 38-year-old father of two for political reasons.
During the investigation, May continued showing up to session every day, though he stayed quiet instead of participating in debates. He continued to vote alongside the Freedom Caucus, though he hadn’t been a member since news broke that investigators had seized his computers in August.
May is scheduled to appear in federal court Aug. 20 for a pre-trial hearing. Jury selection for his trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 10, according to court filings.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 13:56:59.587614

(Courtesy of the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation)Stories involving Agent Orange and similar toxic herbicides used during the Vietnam War tend to be somewhat somber in nature. And there is a very good reason for such sadness. Those chemicals have caused an enormous amount of harm to humans and the environment.
In this account however, I have chosen to focus on a more positive view of the deadly defoliant Agent Orange. That aspect is the approval of a location for a  prominent monument honoring veterans who have died as a result of their exposure to toxic chemicals used by the U.S. military during the war in Southeast Asia.
From the establishment of the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation (UAOVF) in 2023, Vietnam veteran Larry Kerr, the organization’s founder and chairman, conceived of locating an Agent Orange memorial near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial replica in Layton Commons Park.
The park seemed to Larry and others at the UAOVF to be the most advantageous and appropriate site for an Agent Orange monument. This was due in part to its central location, amenities, and military sights. The city’s Veterans Day Parade route also goes through Layton Commons Park.
UAOVF efforts to obtain site approval for the Agent Orange Memorial included speaking with Layton’s mayor, officials at the Department of Parks and Recreation, and addressing city council members at a meeting in February 2025. Unexpected opposition to UAOVF plans however, was encountered from city officials.
That opposition eventually compelled UAOVF officials to consider other potential sites for the Agent Orange Memorial. At a meeting on Aug. 5, those efforts paid off. City officials from Sunset, a city about 8 miles north of Layton, gave the UAOVF permission to locate the memorial in Sunset City Veterans Memorial Park.
UAOVF officials are especially keen about this arrangement and the cordial reception they received from Sunset Mayor Scott Wiggill and other city officials. UAOVF Board of Directors member Hannah Turk echoed the sentiment of other UAOVF members in her enthusiastic comments about the meeting with Sunset City officials. 
In Hannah’s words, “the amazing leadership of Sunset City, and their city council welcomed us with open arms and full hearts. The support we received was overwhelming — in the very best way.” She went on to state that the meeting was “exactly the kind of reception our Vietnam Veterans have long deserved.”
That meeting like its topic, was nothing short of phenomenal. As Larry Kerr recently mentioned to me “the construction of Agent Orange memorials is a relatively new phenomenon that began in the eastern United States and has gradually been increasing in other places.” This expansion is due to the high number of veterans who have been dying from illnesses caused by their Agent Orange exposure.
Utah’s Agent Orange Memorial is one of the latest monuments in this ongoing trend and is destined to alter the state’s landscape as well as its storied history. This is because of the monument’s large size and its unique distinction of being the first of its kind in the Beehive State.
Groundbreaking for the memorial is expected to take place sometime in the near future and If things go as planned, Utah’s Agent Orange Memorial will be dedicated on Veterans Day 2025.

Greystar manages more than 950,000 rental units nationwide, including 34 properties in the Twin Cities and Rochester, according to the company’s website. 
ProPublica reported in 2022 that some of the biggest landlords in the country were using an algorithm developed by RealPage to set rents on open units. RealPage’s algorithm uses data collected from its clients — landlords who compete with each other for renters — to create price recommendations. 
Following ProPublica’s reporting, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and other senators asked the Department of Justice to investigate “allegations of anticompetitive collusion leading to significant increases in rents for apartments.” Klobuchar chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights.
“This settlement is good news for renters across the country,” Klobuchar said in a press release, pointing out that the litigation continued even after President Donald Trump took office. 
In August 2024, the DOJ and several attorneys general, including Minnesota’s Keith Ellison, sued RealPage for “its unlawful scheme to decrease competition among landlords in apartment pricing and to monopolize the market for commercial revenue management software.”
Government lawyers amended the RealPage lawsuit in January to include six of the country’s largest landlords: Greystar, LivCor, Camden, Willow Bridge and Cortland. The amended complaint accused the landlords of not just using RealPage software, but also communicating directly with their competitors about rents, occupancy, pricing strategies and more. 
The proposed settlement, which was agreed to by the DOJ and Greystar, would bar Greystar from using any anticompetitive algorithm that recommends prices based on its competitors’ sensitive data, block the company from sharing sensitive information and require Greystar to cooperate with the ongoing investigation into RealPage. 
A federal judge will decide whether to approve the settlement after a 60-day public comment period.
Greystar admitted to no wrongdoing.
“Greystar remains committed to being at the forefront of innovation in service of its clients and residents, all within the bounds of the law,” the company said in a statement.

(Screengrab You Tube livestream)North Carolinians crowded into Harrah’s Cherokee Center in Asheville Sunday for a chance top hear from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The 83-year-old Vermont senator is using the August congressional recess for a series of stops across the nation billed as the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.
Sanders told the audience that by standing together they can defeat authoritarianism and create a nation and a government that works for all.
“We’ve got a lot of work to do because today in America we are living in a nation in which in many respects we have become an oligarchic society, where our country is being run by a handful of multi-billionaires, and these people worship wealth and they worship power and they could care less about how they get what they want,” said Sander.
Sander said it is time to tell these oligarchs “enough is enough.”
Wealth inequality was a common theme during his 20-minute address.
“One guy — Mr.[Elon] Musk — owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households. It’s really hard to imagine that we have evolved into the kind of society with one man owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. You got the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 93%. You got the CEOs of large corporations making 350 times what their workers make,” Sanders said to an energized base.
Sanders said this disparity rarely receives the attention it deserves because of the concentration of ownership in the media.
“Why do you think the American people don’t discuss the important issues facing the working class of this country? It has everything to do with the fact that you have six major media conglomerates owning control what 90% of the American people see, hear and read,” Sanders said.
He called out Musk’s ownership of X, Larry Ellison’s purchase of Paramount (which owns CBS), Jeff Bezos’ ownership of the Washington Post, and Rupert Murdoch’s control of Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and more.
Sanders said ever since the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, billionaires have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into both political parties to buy more and more influence.
He told the crowd that if America hoped to retain democracy it would need to overturn Citizens United and embrace the public funding of elections.
“If you want to run for office, I want you to be able to do so, but you should not have to beg billionaires for campaign contributions and be beholden to them,” he said.
The progressive senator gave the audience plenty of reasons to consider a run for local office: a lack of affordable housing, an educational system from childcare to college that is much too expensive, and a health care system in which 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured.
At a Friday appearance in Wheeling, West Virginia, Sanders told the crowd one of the reasons he believed former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 race was because she had “too many billionaires telling her not to speak up for the working class of this country.”
Sander steered clear of that assertion in Asheville, instead noting Trump and his associates believe in a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, and for the billionaire class.
“In this difficult moment in American history, we have got to respond in an unprecedented way. We need you. You can’t sit it out. Sorry, I know it’s tempting. You can’t put your head under your covers, we need you to join us in the struggle.”
Before Sunday’s Asheville rally, Sanders dismissed the likelihood that he would run for president in 2028. He turns 84 in September.
But the Vermont independent told CNN’s “State of the Union” there would be a younger candidate representing the party’s progressive wing.

He has appeared with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., by his side in more than half a dozen Fighting Oligarchy events. Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke has also shared the stage with Sanders.
Attracting younger voters to their cause may be key.
In the 2024 general election, just 57.4% of North Carolina’s eligible voters age 18-25 cast a ballot in the presidential election. For the 2024 primary, less than 8% of eligible voters in that age bracket voted.
Sanders knows they will need to improve turnout to see a reversal of fortunes.
“I don’t have a PhD in mathematics but I do know that 99% is a hell of a bigger number than 1%,” said Sanders in closing out his North Carolina appearance. “Brothers and sisters, let’s go forward. Let’s take on these oligarchs let’s beat them.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bernie2.jpg,,,2025-08-11 13:56:59.587614

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen. 


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Courtesy of Getty Images)On Monday, the state House voted on a bill that would increase funding for transit agencies across the commonwealth. The bill will go to the Republican-controlled Senate, which is set to return to Capitol in Harrisburg tomorrow.
House Democrats say it was a necessary move to shore up funding as the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) warns of impending service cuts if they don’t receive more state support. But, Republicans in the chamber accused the other side of the aisle of political gamesmanship.
The bill increases funding for mass transit agencies in rural, urban and suburban areas by giving an additional 1.75% of the total sales tax collected to mass transit agencies. Democrats also emphasized that the bill included a number of Republican transportation priorities, including funding for roads and bridges and requirements that transit agencies explore public-private projects and combat fare evasion.

For months, lawmakers have been discussing how to increase transit funding as part of broader budget negotiations. But, six weeks after the constitutionally mandated June 30 deadline to pass it, SEPTA announced last week that it will have to cut service by 20% if lawmakers don’t act to boost their funding by Aug. 14.
“I believe there are those who want to play politics or leverage for other issues, but the simple reality is there is an issue in front of us, a transit crisis,” House majority leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) said.
Republican Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford), however, said the House’s move was nothing but a political show.
“While we believe [transit funding] is an integral part of the budget discussions that have been going on, it is part of the budget discussions,” Topper said. “We have to be able to get into a room and fix this budget in its entirety, not one issue at a time.”
Topper said that the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to act on transit funding as a standalone issue, instead viewing it as part of broader budget negotiations.
A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) did not respond to a request for comment. 
Roughly 1 million Pennsylvanians — about one in 13  people in the state — use mass transit every day in all 67 counties. About 800,000 of those use SEPTA. But transit authorities outside of the Philadelphia area have also warned they face service cuts if no additional funding is provided by the legislature.

Trump administration requested voter data. Secretary Bellows says, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine’

Bellows requested that the DOJ provide an explanation of why it made such requests in Maine, which included the statewide voter registration list, names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance and the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship, among other information about the state’s election processes.
“The United States Constitution entrusted the states, not the federal government, with responsibility for administering elections, and that’s a critically important check and balance on potential federal abuse of power,” Bellows shared in a statement on Monday. “The Department of Justice doesn’t get to know everything about you just because they want to, and I will do everything in my power to protect the privacy and security of Maine voters.”
Bellows received the detailed request from the the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ on July 24, following a less expansive inquiry from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys on July 10 for a phone call with Bellows to discuss a “potential information-sharing agreement” to provide the DOJ with information on registered voters in Maine.
In her response on Friday, Bellows also rejected the premise of some of the DOJ’s requests, including questioning the data provided for the election administration and voting survey conducted by the Election Assistance Commission, an independent agency of the U.S. government created by Congress in 2002 to aid the states in conducting safe and secure elections.
For example, the July 24 request noted that Maine’s survey response showed that there were nearly as many registered voters listed as active as the citizen voting age population in Maine in 2024, with a registration rate of 92.4%. The letter went on to request further details about the state’s response, such as information about the actions Maine is taking to ensure that ineligible voters are being removed and a list of all duplicate registrants the state has removed.
“Mainers should be extremely proud that our state is a national leader in voter registration and voter turnout,” Bellows said in a statement Monday. “Every eligible voter in Maine has the right to vote and should be encouraged to do so. Why the Department of Justice would question Maine’s success is beyond me and smacks of federal interference in our elections.”

Interestingly, in recent months, rather than proposing to make the minimum wage a living wage, some politicians – including President Trump – have championed the idea of ending taxes on the tips. Indeed, it’s a change that was included in the so-called big, beautiful bill Trump recently signed into law.
Unfortunately, while it’s an idea that may have superficial appeal in some circles, as researchers at the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center detailed in a recent brief, the proposal is more of a gimmick that would actually do little to help many low-income workers.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A legislative task force aiming to reduce property taxes for South Dakota homeowners will meet in Aberdeen this week with opportunities for public input.
The Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force will meet at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday at the Kessler’s Champions Club on the Northern State University campus, and 9 a.m. on Wednesday in the same location.
The Tuesday evening meeting is dedicated solely to public comment, and the group is also scheduled to take public comment at 9 a.m. during the Wednesday meeting. Wednesday’s agenda also includes breakout discussions among task force members focusing on the intersection of property taxes with school, state government and local government funding.
From property to purchases: Task force considering fundamental tax shift to reduce homeowner burden

The task force is exploring government spending reductions as a potential way to cut property tax burdens. The group is also discussing an optional county-level sales tax of a half-percent to offset participating counties’ property taxes on owner-occupied homes, and a new state sales tax of 1% dedicated to education funding. The 1% tax would apply to most of the products and services that are currently exempted from sales taxes, and would stack on top of the existing state sales tax rate of 4.2% for other transactions.
Members of Abolish Property Taxes South Dakota pitched a transaction tax to the group at its Rapid City meeting last month. The proposal would aim to replace property taxes by adding a flat $1.50 tax on transactions of $15 or greater, and a tax of 10% on smaller transactions.
Earlier this year, lawmakers adopted Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposal to slow property tax increases with multifaceted reforms including a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments. That new law took effect July 1.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN — Straight-line winds of 80-90 mph tore the roof off of parts of two housing units Saturday at the aging Nebraska State Penitentiary, displacing 387 inmates, the state announced.
Damage estimates and first steps toward temporary repairs were still taking place Monday, though more information was expected from the Department of Correctional Services.

Video of the damage shows parts of the roof being pulled off of a facility that has been the subject of much discussion in the Legislature for its need for upgrades or replacement.
Gov. Jim Pillen, in a tweet Sunday on X, credited Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys and his staff for safely relocating the inmates and said he was “incredibly proud” of their work.
Jeffreys, in a statement, said his team across the department trains “for the unexpected,” and “came together” to make sure “everyone was safe.” No injuries were reported.

About 250 of the 387 displaced inmates were moved from the two damaged housing units to a gym on site at the State Penitentiary. The remainder were sent to prisons in Tecumseh and Omaha.
Correctional Services set up a website for friends and family members to check if their loved ones were impacted, at https://corrections.nebraska.gov/rehabilitation/friends-and-family.
Repairs could take at least a month, according to a department press release from Sunday. Visits to inmates at the State Pen were canceled this weekend as the department assesses damage.

Saint Mark’s High School has appointed Aine Lafferty Bruhl as its new Director of Visual and Performing Arts, bringing with her more than a decade of experience in arts education, performance, and nonprofit leadership.
Bruhl steps into the role after serving as Program Director at the Philadelphia Arts in Education Partnership.
There, she managed arts programming in eight public schools and led professional development initiatives for teaching artists, along with community and family engagement efforts.
Her career also includes seven years at the Charter School of New Castle, where she founded the middle school drama program and served as Visual and Performing Arts Coordinator.
During her tenure, she directed school productions and secured grants to support arts integration.
READ: Strong start to rec. marijuana sales, nearly hitting $1M in first weekend
Bruhl’s early work included teaching theater, music, and dance in schools and community programs across New York and Pennsylvania, including the Walnut Street Theatre and Riverdale YM-YWHA.
These roles laid the foundation for her enduring commitment to the arts and student-centered education.
At Saint Mark’s, Bruhl will lead the growth of the school’s visual and performing arts (VPA) program.
She aims to strengthen existing offerings while introducing new opportunities that make the arts more accessible and appealing to all students.
“Working for a well-established institution like Saint Mark’s excites me because of its rich history and the many individuals who have poured their time and energy into its success,” Bruhl said. “I’m eager to elevate the Visual and Performing Arts program, putting it on the map as a competitive and inclusive space where every student can find a way to be involved.”
Bruhl envisions a future where Saint Mark’s becomes a destination for aspiring young artists.
“I envision students applying to Saint Mark’s specifically to be part of its thriving theatre, dance, music, and visual arts programs, establishing the VPA department as a true draw and point of pride for the school,” she said.
Her plans include launching new student-led projects, building community partnerships, and connecting creative work to real-world careers.
Many of the careers students aspire to pursue rely on the very skills developed in arts classes, such as collaboration, problem-solving, innovation, and communication,” she said. “By highlighting how these skills translate beyond the arts, I hope to inspire more students to see the value of participating in VPA programming.”
Among her ideas are original student-written plays, improv-based clubs, and expanded involvement in local arts events in Delaware and Philadelphia.
While she kept upcoming production themes under wraps, Bruhl hinted that exciting details are on the way.
Dr. Eileen Wilkinson, principal of Saint Mark’s, expressed enthusiasm about Bruhl’s arrival.
“From her initial interview, I knew Mrs. Bruhl shared the mission of Saint Mark’s with a strong commitment to making the world more pleasing to God through the visual and performing arts,” she said. “Her passion and expertise will make more things possible for our students. I look forward to working with Mrs. Bruhl in the years to come.”

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis did appoint a state trial judge on time, contrary to a complaint filed with the Florida Supreme Court last week by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The ACLU had urged the justices Friday to order DeSantis to fill the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court judgeship, which the state still listed as vacant at the time despite the constitutionally mandated window to fill it having elapsed.
Florida Supreme Court petition demands DeSantis fill vacant judgeship

Not so, lawyers for the state declared in a legal pleading filed later on Friday.
“Petitioner confidently asserts that the Governor ‘has refused to perform his duty to fill a vacancy on the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court’ by the constitutionally mandated deadline of August 3, 2025. … This is false,” DeSantis’ attorneys wrote, stating that the governor had appointed Alachua County Court Judge Kristine Van Vorst to the circuit court on Aug. 1.
Accompanying DeSantis’ response to the ACLU was his letter of that date informing Van Vorst of her appointment.
The ACLU, suing on behalf of Gary Edinger, a resident of the judicial circuit, pointed out that DeSantis’ office had not responded to its inquiries about the vacancy’s status before it filed suit against the governor, nor did it publish a news release announcing the appointment.
“Florida’s Constitution requires our government operate in the sunshine, not in secret,” they wrote in their notice of voluntary dismissal of the case, filed Monday.
As of this publication, the letter appointing Van Vorst had not been published on the governor’s appointments website, although the position was marked as filled.
A Phoenix check of the governor’s judicial appointment page last week, after the Aug. 1 appointment, showed that the spot was vacant.
“Despite making the at-issue appointment eight days ago, the Governor choose not to announce his action until after business hours a week later, only after Petitioner filed suit. Nor did the Governor’s counsel respond to undersigned counsel’s repeated pre-filing inquiries about whether the appointment was made,” the plaintiff’s attorneys wrote.
The circuit covers Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Gilchrist, Levy, and Union counties.
The difference between an appointment before or after Aug. 18 would’ve been the difference between the new judge’s first election happening in 2026 or 2028, the ACLU contended, potentially giving the appointee an “extra two unlawful years” to serve, the initial motion filed last week argued.
Primary elections are scheduled for Aug. 18, 2026. Per the Constitution, appointees don’t need to stand in an election happening less than a year from the date of appointment.

Article Summary

No Republican candidates have publicly announced they’re running for three statewide offices and just two have announced plans to run for governor as Gov. JB Pritzker seeks a third term.
Illinois GOP Chair Kathy Salvi says the One Big Beautiful Bill will be part of her party’s pitch to voters in 2026.
Both political parties will unofficially begin the 2026 campaign with rallies at the State Fair in Springfield this week.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 

SPRINGFIELD — With U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, Comptroller Susana Mendoza and other members of Congress not seeking reelection in 2026, robust fields are growing in the Democratic primaries for the open seats.
Gov. JB Pritzker is seeking a rare third term and has been on the campaign trail for more than a month. Three high-profile Democrats are seeking to replace Durbin, sparking a flurry of state-level Democrats seeking to climb the political ladder.
But on the Republican side, it’s a ghost town in primary races for statewide offices so far.
﻿
“We’ve been decimated to the point in Illinois where we don’t have a strong bench,” former Republican State Rep. Mark Batinick, now a political consultant, told Capitol News Illinois.
At this week’s Illinois State Fair political days – long viewed as the unofficial start to election season in Illinois – the GOP’s focus will largely be on Washington in the absence of prominent state-level candidates, according to the state party chair.
“We have an opportunity in Illinois not only because Pritzker is such a trainwreck, but also because so many great things are happening with the leadership of this Republican president,” Illinois Republican Party Chair Kathy Salvi said in an interview.
But winning statewide elections has been a daunting task for Illinois Republicans since President Donald Trump first entered the national political stage in 2016. Two years later, in 2018, a “blue wave” swept the nation in Trump’s first midterm election and Pritzker was elected governor. Since that year, Democrats seeking statewide offices have cruised to victory.
Thus far, just two lesser-known Republicans have expressed interest in challenging Pritzker in 2026. A similar group of lesser-known candidates is considering a U.S. Senate run, but there has been no news about anyone running for comptroller, treasurer or secretary of state.
It’s still early in the election cycle — the petition gathering period began last week and runs through October — and Salvi said she expects there will be a Republican candidate in November for each statewide office.
GOP’s 2026 message
The Illinois GOP isn’t going to shy away from Trump, Salvi said, even though the party often tried to ignore his influence under her predecessor, Don Tracy, who is considering a run for statewide office.
Salvi said embracing the One Big Beautiful Bill will be a key part of her party’s message in 2026 that she believes will resonate with voters. She encouraged voters to find common ground on areas they agree with Trump and ignore things they disagree with.
“Look at the success of this White House,” Salvi said. “Go to the White House website every week, or more than that, and learn what’s happening. And if there’s something you don’t like, then fine. Just don’t talk about that. Look to what you do like. Find what we have in common.”
That’s a welcome strategy for the Illinois Freedom Caucus, a group of the General Assembly’s most conservative lawmakers that has criticized the party for not embracing Trump in recent years.
Collin Moseley, the caucus’ state director, said in an interview they want the party to support Trump-aligned candidates, but the Illinois party still has too many leaders who disassociate with Trump.
“I think that it’s mostly being stifled by people who hate Donald Trump in our own party, people who are clinging with a death grip to hold our party further to the left instead of moving to the right to the issues that working families care about,” Moseley said. “We are stuck in this old-fashioned way of campaigning and the old Republican Party that mostly has lost its way.”

Salvi is also hoping to capitalize on Trump’s performance in Illinois in 2024, in which he cut down 17-point losses in 2016 and 2020 to about 11 points, largely due to a falloff in Democratic votes. Meanwhile, Republicans did not lose seats in Springfield despite Democrats targeting several vulnerable districts.
Pritzker beatable? 
Pritzker is beatable, Batinick argued, citing the results of a poll released Thursday conducted by his polling firm and commissioned by the conservative Illinois Policy Institute where Batinick also works as a policy analyst. It found Pritzker’s favorability rating was at 47%.
The poll conducted last month of 752 likely 2026 Illinois voters found 60% of voters say “high taxes” is a top issue for them, while 26% named “state governance” as a top issue. Batinick said Pritzker appears set to run on his record of governing the state, but also frequently discusses national issues.
“The issues that matter to Illinoisans aren’t the issues that JB Pritzker is talking about right now,” he said.
The primary race to challenge Pritzker is still taking shape with DuPage County Sheriff Jim Mendrick the most notable name seeking the office so far. Lake Forest businessman Joseph Severino, who has run for Congress as a Republican and independent, has announced his intention to run for governor, but has not filed a fundraising committee with the State Board of Elections.
Batinick said that politicians seeking to “climb the political ladder” benefit from running for office, but the risk of losing their current elected position is keeping Republicans from stepping into a race where their odds of winning are low in a state that leans left.
“Everybody has to give up what they got to run for something that they don’t think they can win,” he said. “They’re looking at a Trump midterm; they’re looking at a lack of money; they’re looking a lack of excitement at the top of the ticket for governor and senator to date.”
Batinick thinks the right Republican candidate can beat Gov. JB Pritzker and overcome his spending power.
“A Republican candidate is going to have to work hard on the ground and we’re going to have to band together to really match the money that he can just buy,” Batinick said. “Republicans are going to have to do it with volunteers. It’s possible, you just need somebody that is inspiring to the public.”
Other offices
In the Senate race, four Republicans have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and are actively raising money.
Former Illinois Republican Party Chair Don Tracy is reportedly considering running for either governor or Senate and is expected to make an announcement soon. Ted Dabrowski, the president of conservative research site Wirepoints, is also considering running for governor.

Bob Fioretti, who has unsuccessfully run for several offices as a member of both parties, is reportedly circulating petitions to run for attorney general.
But even as petition-gathering begins, no other candidates are publicly known to be interested in running for other statewide offices. Notable names, including U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood and former Illinois Republican National Committeeman Richard Porter have declined to run for governor or Senate.
Candidate recruitment isn’t the state party’s role but rather turning out voters, said Salvi, an attorney from Mundelein who was the party’s nominee for U.S. Senate in 2022.
Democrats’ national focus 
While Republicans head into the State Fair still in search of people to run for statewide office, Democrats have two primary elections for statewide offices and three crowded primaries for congressional seats in the Chicago area.
The primary for the open comptroller seat continues to expand. Rep. Stephanie Kifowit, D-Oswego, announced on Monday she will run for the seat, joining Rep. Margaret Croke, D-Chicago, and Lake County Treasurer Holly Kim in the race as other Democrats also consider jumping in.
But even as some Democrats gear up to compete against each other, much of the party’s focus this summer has been on national politics, including currently hosting Democrats in the Texas House who left their state to prevent a vote on redrawing Texas’ congressional maps.

After the Illinois Democratic Party hosted Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin last week for one of several news conferences in the western suburbs with Texas Democrats, the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association will host U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies at their annual brunch on Wednesday in Springfield as part of State Fair festivities.
“Illinoisans face unprecedented harm from Donald Trump and Elon Musk and I cannot think of a better national leader right now to talk to our party about how to meet this moment,” association President Mark Guethle said in a statement.
Pritzker, who has put himself at the center of Texas’ redistricting fight, will also hold the governor’s traditional event at the State Fair on Wednesday afternoon. Pritzker has continued trying to grow his national profile this summer amid speculation he plans to run for president in 2028, including with an appearance on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show on CBS last week.
The Republicans will host FOX News analyst Gianno Caldwell as their keynote speaker at the fair on Thursday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-11 16:10:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"NYC is nation’s capital of immigration courthouse arrests, analysis shows",Haidee Chu and Gwynne Hogan | THE CITY,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/11/nyc-immigration-courthouse-arrests-data-analysis/,"Half of all immigration courthouse arrests in the USearlier this summer took place in Manhattan, a new data analysis shows.","On a recent morning in Lower Manhattan, immigration Judge John Siemietkowski spoke to three people in his courtroom while masked federal officers waited just outside. 
“I’m sure you can see with your own eyes what’s going on in our courthouse,” Siemietkowski said. 
“You may see someone you know get arrested. You yourself may get arrested,” he warned. “That’s a heavy topic, isn’t it? A lot like the weather today. It’s heavy, and it weighs on us.”
Siemietkowski scheduled the three for court dates in 2026 and dismissed them. As they left the courtroom, two of them, a married couple from Panama, walked by the officers unimpeded. But when the third man, from the Dominican Republic, passed the officers, he was grabbed by the shoulders in plain view of Siemietkowski’s dais and escorted down a stairwell.
Such scenes have played out over and over again in the more than two months since officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies began lurking in the fluorescent-lit corridors of the three Manhattan courthouses where immigrants in deportation proceedings plead their cases. 
Half of all immigration court arrests nationwide were in New York City in late May and early June, according to a new analysis of federal immigration court and ICE data by THE CITY and Joseph Gunther, a Brooklyn mathematician who first identified a method to track courthouse arrests. 

ICE officers elsewhere have been detaining thousands of people at workplaces, Home Depot parking lots and even sending militarized cavalry units through big city parks. But enforcement in New York City has been focused inside of the very buildings where people show up at civil immigration hearings to petition for the right to legally remain in the United States. It’s an approach that the agency had taken pains to avoid before Trump’s second term because of the deterrent effect it has on noncitizens with immigration court hearings. 
That changed dramatically in New York City this late spring. Between May 26 and June 8, court and ICE records show, federal officers arrested 134 people in Lower Manhattan immigration courthouse buildings, accounting for nearly a third of all immigration arrests in New York City in that period. 
Overall, immigration courthouse arrests have been nearly 14 times as common in New York City than the country as a whole. They made up 7% of all ICE arrests in the city since President Donal Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 through June, compared to 0.5% nationally over the same period of time.
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to THE CITY’s request for comment on the analysis, which cross-references Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) court data with ICE arrest records to identify cases that show a court hearing on the same date as an arrest.
At the same time that courthouse arrests began ramping up, ICE also ratcheted up arrests at mandatory check-ins with the agency. Those arrests took place at offices like the one across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, where THE CITY witnessed 31 arrests over two days, as well as another office inside 26 Federal Plaza itself, where people line up each morning. Some never get to leave of their own accord.
Federal agents wait to detain people outside immigration courts at 26 Federal Plaza, Aug. 7, 2025.
As a result of the courthouse arrests ICE has emphasized in New York City, a large number of arrests here are happening behind closed doors — sparing Mayor Eric Adams the spectacle of roundups on city streets seen elsewhere in the country and the potential for clashes with New Yorkers. 
In Los Angeles, immigration arrests in highly visible public settings triggered sustained mass protests, leading President Trump to deploy the National Guard and then the Marines to assist ICE agents in June. Mayor Karen Bass described Los Angeles as “a city under siege, under armed occupation.” 
While smaller protests have been common, no such dramatic standoffs have occurred yet in New York City, where Adams has pledged to work with the Trump administration on matters that don’t involve civil immigration enforcement, taking a less adversarial approach to ICE than mayors in other Democratic strongholds.
In April, the Trump Justice Department dropped the criminal corruption case against Adams. Less than a day later, Adams, who was elected in 2021 as a Democrat, announced a longshot independent bid for a second term.
Missing Persons
EOIR data shows the surge in courthouse arrests kicked off nationally on May 19 and ramped up in New York City several days later. A former employee at the New York immigration court said that everyone — including Department of Homeland Security attorneys who serve as prosecutors inside the immigration court system — seemed surprised on the day in May when they first saw ICE agents in the hallways. 
Federal agents bring a couple onto an elevator at 26 Federal Plaza after they finished an immigration hearing, June 10, 2025.
“We had no notice this was happening, I don’t think the prosecutors had much notice either,” the former employee recalled, saying the DHS prosecutors had been ordered to come to the building in person instead of appearing virtually as they typically did. 
ICE agents had been in or near the courthouse before then — for example, if an immigrant had a serious criminal conviction that made them subject to rules requiring detention while a case proceeded. But that was exceedingly rare, the former EOIR employee said.
“Even that hadn’t happened in years,” the person said. “It’s never been anything like this.”
In New York City, 110 people were arrested on the same day as their immigration court hearing through June under the Trump administration, court data shows, accounting for 24% of the 453 such arrests nationwide. 
But ICE likely arrested even more people here in connection with court appearances. 
The agency’s own arrest data, when cross-referenced with court data, suggests at least another 71 people in New York City were detained on the same day as their hearing. That brings the number of total immigration court arrests in the city this year to 181 — a dramatic escalation from 11 arrests all of last year, including just three over the same time period. 
Taken together, the analysis found 31% of all ICE arrests in the city took place in immigration courts in the two weeks between May 26 and June 8, when courthouse arrests spiked across the country.

Other cities trailed far behind: San Diego was a distant second with 37 arrests, followed by 32 in Annandale, Va., and 29 in Newark, N. J., according to court data. 
In Los Angeles, where ICE arrests have also surged, EOIR records show only six arrests within its three immigration courts.
New York City’s courthouse arrests have exclusively targeted adults, and mostly men, records show, with the youngest confirmed arrest that of a 19-year-old Venezuelan teen, and the oldest a 63-year-old from Ecuador. 
Just three of the people arrested were represented by a lawyer. Many judges allow people with attorneys to appear virtually, leaving many without representation to face a gauntlet of masked ICE agents awaiting their arrival alone.

Even past the 181 arrests THE CITY identified in government records, our reporting found several additional arrests were not reflected in court records — highlighting that these preliminary tallies are undoubtedly an undercount. 
The arrest of 20-year-old high schooler Joselyn Chipantiza-Sisalema, who was taken from a court hearing in late June, for example, is not reflected in the current court data.
The court data also omits the detention of a 19-year-old man from Guinea who ICE records indicate was arrested on the same day as his court hearing at 26 Federal Plaza. He has since been transferred to a detention center in Jonesboro, Louisiana, where he was held for 26 days before being transferred to another detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
Black Box
The scene at the immigration courthouse on the 12th floor of 26 Federal Plaza on a recent morning showed the ICE arrest apparatus now well entrenched.
Judge James Loprest was out for the day, but many people with pending cases had dutifully shown up anyway. They took turns speaking to the clerk, who handed them notices to appear at a later date. But as they tried to leave, masked agents confronted them at the doorway asking for identification. 
Federal agents guard a stairwell while their colleagues detain people leaving immigration court inside 26 Federal Plaza, Aug. 7, 2025.
Agents whisked a 19-year-old girl into a stairwell for questioning before releasing her several minutes later. 
A woman who looked to be in her thirties, wearing gold high heels and a sparkly green jumpsuit, was not so lucky. The woman’s hands trembled as the agents towered over her. “But I haven’t done anything,” she said incredulously in Spanish, weeping softly and asking a volunteer stationed nearby to call her husband, who was waiting for her outside. 
“It’s not a question,” an agent said in Spanish with a thick American accent. “We said you’re leaving with us.” 
Moments later, the men surrounded the woman and rushed her to a back stairwell and out of sight. She — like the many others apprehended inside immigration courthouses at 26 Federal Plaza, 290 Broadway and on Varick Street — was detained for processing in the ICE office on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza. As the number of arrests has soared in recent weeks, ICE has struggled to move people into actual detention centers, leaving some for days in cramped holding rooms with no beds and limited food.
On Friday, the ACLU sued the Trump Administration over conditions there. People haven’t been able to speak privately with lawyers, the lawsuit alleged, and are only given limited food and left to sleep for days on concrete floors in unsanitary conditions. DHS has flatly denied any mistreatment while repeatedly denying members of Congress access to the site, keeping it entirely out of public view until THE CITY first published videos of it in July. 
City Comptroller Brad Lander — who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June while accompanying immigrants to their court appearances — was reluctant during his most recent visit on Thursday to speculate about why enforcement had taken such a different shape in New York.
“It’s one of the big questions,” Lander said, pointing to the public scenes of intimidation in Los Angeles.
Lander has called on Adams to enforce potential building and fire code violations on ICE’s detention floor, though Adams said he has no jurisdiction over the federal building. 
“It’s certainly possible that there’s some implicit deal between the Trump administration and Eric Adams, which is why these arrests are being concentrated here versus other places around the country,” Lander said when pressed about why enforcement here had been so different. 
“If the mayor wants to demonstrate that there isn’t, there’s a lot of ways for him to show he’s objecting to what’s going on here that he’s failed to do.”
Asked about Lander’s comments, Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for Adams, said that “I can’t tell you why they’re doing this at 26 Federal Plaza.” 
She said the mayor has been clear he’s open to working with the Trump administration on criminal matters but draws the line on civil immigration enforcement. She also noted New York City had not seen immigration raids in sensitive locations like churches and schools — something Adams had urged Homan against during their meetings.
“Not having an adversarial-at-all-times relationship can sometimes be beneficial,” said Mamelak.
The Trump administration sued the mayor and City Council in late July, demanding an end to sanctuary city laws that prohibit local government cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. The Adams administration is suing in return, including three lawsuits on behalf of students arrested at immigration court appearances.
“What’s going on at 26 Fed, the mayor opposes, and he’s taken action on that,” Mamelak said. 
Adams, however, has largely avoided answering questions or speaking on camera about those conditions. He has repeatedly stressed that the city isn’t responsible for what happens inside of the ICE offices, now including a jail, inside its real estate in Manhattan.
Meanwhile, ICE immigration court arrests continue day after day for people who continue to show up at their court appearances. 
‘Guiding Star’?
Courthouse arrests have mostly targeted people who entered the country less than two years ago, THE CITY’s analysis shows, confirming what the Trump administration has said is a new focus on attempting to funnel people into “expedited removal” proceedings that can circumvent immigration courts, which are facing historic backlogs and take years to resolve a person’s deportation case. 
But while DHS prosecutors regularly asked judges to dismiss a person’s deportation case ahead of their arrest, judges rarely approved those requests.
A family leaves an immigration hearing at 26 Federal Plaza after walking past federal agents, Aug. 7, 2025.
Government prosecutors had requested that judges dismiss the removal proceedings in 100 of the 181 instances where people were arrested on the day of their court hearing, THE CITY’s analysis shows. But judges denied 69 of those requests and left 23 of them undecided.  
That means only eight dismissals were approved — and that the other 173 people were arrested while their cases were still ongoing, forcing them to fight their asylum claims from behind bars in most cases.
“We very quickly saw on the ground that the procedural posture didn’t actually matter,” said Allison Cutler, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group. She is one of a handful of attorneys keeping watch on the courthouse arrests, and attempts to advise people without lawyers of their rights as they’re rushed away.
Over the past two months, Cutler has become friendly with court staff, security guards, judges, and even the federal agents, who’ve all had their status quo upended by the arrests. 
Many agents, she pointed out, have been drafted from other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to conduct courthouse arrests on behalf of ICE. 
“I’ve had multiple officers tell me that they’re gonna quit,” Cutler said, adding they’ve told her they’ve had to forgo working on prior investigations to arrest people inside courtrooms. “They have asked their supervisors if they can continue to work on their investigations, and they’re being told no, and that they have to go to court and do this.”
Meanwhile, immigration judges and court staff in New York are grappling with a grim new normal, with each of them struggling to work out the rules for their courtrooms.
A former New York immigration judge, who called fairness “the guiding star” of the system, called the shift in tactics deeply troubling and unprecedented. 
“Now you’re a tool in someone’s tool box so that a person can be detained,” the judge said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080725_ice_arrests-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 12:59:03.351733

She fell over, got back up, and resumed working. She had 40-pound boxes of freshly packed chicken to carry roughly seven minutes from the line to the frying area.
The further along in her pregnancy, the harder it was to do her job – and the more scared she was for herself and her baby. She asked to be moved to a less intensive position for the rest of her pregnancy. Her supervisors refused.
She says they asked her to present a doctor’s note before they allowed her to take more bathroom breaks than the one per shift granted to all workers.
“They don’t move you to another position, even if you have a fever, even if you’re crying,” Maria said. “Because they say, ‘It’s your job, you already know your job.’” 
So she kept clocking in at 6 a.m. until she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant. 
Six years after Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on seven Mississippi poultry plants brought national attention to an industry that had profited from undocumented labor for decades, more than a dozen current and former immigrant workers told Mississippi Today that deteriorated working conditions persist for undocumented employees as well as those with work permits or green cards. Most interviews were conducted in Spanish, with some workers’ first names changed and their last names not used because they feared retaliation and deportation.

ICE detained 680 mostly Latino workers in the August 2019 raids. The year prior, Koch Foods settled a class action lawsuit for $3.75 million. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged the company with sexual harassment, national origin and race discrimination as well as retaliation against Latino workers at its Morton plant.
Following the raids, three plant managers and human resources staff were sentenced to up to two years of probation for knowingly “harboring illegal aliens.” 
Years later, loopholes persist. Several workers told Mississippi Today it is still possible to find employment in the chicken plants without work authorization, often using fake papers or a contractor.
This practice isn’t unique to Mississippi. In 2024, nationally, around 23% of workers in the meatpacking industry were undocumented and 42% were foreign-born, the American Immigration Council told Wired Magazine. Undocumented immigrants represent 4.6% of the U.S. employed labor force.
“They seek out the most vulnerable workers, who are not going to complain and not going to demand better conditions,” said Debbie Berkowitz, a former policy adviser for Occupational Safety and Health Administration and worker safety expert who has written about the poultry industry.

Before obtaining a work permit in 2021 and finding employment in a Tyson plant, Gabby worked for two other poultry processing companies under a fake name. She paid a U.S. citizen $1,700 to use the person’s Social Security number and name at work.
Koch Foods, her first employer, hired her in 2006 through a third party. The only form of identification required was that Social Security number. 
Her contractor, a single person who operated through word of mouth, didn’t provide her with a contract – only paying her cash. When he held her pay for over a month, Gabby complained to plant managers. They said her salary wasn’t processed through the plant’s payroll department and they were not accountable.
“The first thing most people think is, if I speak up, ICE is going to come for me,” Gabby said. “The last thing you want to do is create problems. What you want to do is work.” 
In order to keep her job, she had to lie and maintain a fake identity. She lived in fear of being found out.
“You go to work with fear, you go with shame,” she said.
Working with fake papers can make getting a doctor’s excuse for missed days nearly impossible. Maria was able to get six weeks of unpaid maternity leave with a doctor’s note because she worked under her real name, but other pregnant women needed a doctor who agreed to forge their fake name on medical records.
Gabby says she was fired from her job at Koch Foods because she gave the contact information of a willing doctor to other undocumented workers. Koch Foods didn’t answer multiple requests for comment on allegations made by workers.
Past the limit
Across all assembly lines, the piece rate – the number of chickens that workers handle per minute –  directly affects the likelihood of developing pains or muscle and bone injuries, a study funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found. Only the evisceration line speed, or the phase where chickens are killed, is federally regulated. Piece rate is determined mainly by the job-specific line speed and staffing level.
The same study found that 81% of U.S. poultry plant workers had an “unacceptably high” risk of musculoskeletal disease. To mitigate that risk, authors recommended increasing staffing levels and decreasing line speeds.
But several workers said line speeds were used to increase pressure on employees. Miguel, an 18-year Koch Foods employee, claims he was pushed to resign within months by a supervisor who continuously increased line speeds as punishment.
He started in 2000 in the debone section, cutting chicken parts from hanging carcasses, then became a lead person. For an additional $1 per hour, he was watching over two lines of 30 workers in total. He says he was demoted by this new supervisor who took a dislike to him.
The supervisor would single him and another employee out, place them on another line and speed it up. 
“He told me he wanted us to do double duty: What four people were doing, he wanted two to do,” Miguel said.
After three failed attempts to report the situation to managers, Miguel quit and found work in construction. Koch Foods did not provide comment on how line speeds are set and managed at the plant. 
Every worker interviewed described as routine hostility from supervisors and managers, harassment and arbitrary punishments targeting immigrant workers. 
“I feel like it doesn’t matter if you speak English or not, they’re going to look at you ugly. They treat you wrong just because they feel they have that authority, that they’re the boss,” said Sofi, a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. She started working at Koch Foods in February and quit after four months.
Injured and fired
Annual employee turnover averages 65% but ranges as high as 150% in poultry plants nationally, according to a survey by the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association. Over half of employees last less than three months on the job. 
Employees told Mississippi Today that almost anything can be grounds for termination. Half of the dozen workers interviewed said they witnessed or experienced layoffs following an injury on the job.
Repeating the same motions hundreds of times a day, for years, can lead to chronic pains and eventually injuries. Maribel, a 17-year Koch Foods employee, tucked chicken wings for eight years with an overstretched tendon in her hand. With the pain on her mind, she says she was terminated in March after she requested to not be moved to the more intensive deboning section, where workers handle large metallic scissors.
Idalia, a green card holder, says Tyson Foods fired her after she reported a dislocated shoulder with a doctor’s note in 2023. She marinated chicken, a job that requires repetitive hand and arm movements. She now works for Koch Foods, where she packs boxes of chicken with growing pain in her hand from knocking her hands against tape dispensers and frozen chicken six days a week.

Poultry plants are required to report injuries needing treatment beyond first aid or resulting in lost work days to OSHA. Lost work days must also be reported to the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission.
Mississippi law states that all injured workers, regardless of immigration status, are entitled to workers’ compensation, and medical and wage loss benefits, even if they get fired following the injury.
However, undocumented workers are less likely to claim the benefits, due to a lack of information and fear that drawing attention to themselves could lead to deportation.
Several employees told Mississippi Today that some plants found a way around reporting injuries to OSHA.

A bad fall on his hips in a Koch Foods plant injured Miguel enough that he couldn’t work for two weeks. While recovering, he came in every day, clocked in and out at his regular hours, pretending to be working as usual. For the entirety of his shift, he sat in the rest area.
His managers said it was the only way he could get paid while he was injured.
Three workers interviewed said they witnessed injured employees sitting all day in the cafeteria or their supervisor’s office. Koch did not respond to a request for comment.
“I think not wanting folks to report is an OSHA question, and then not wanting folks to get access to medical care and disability benefits is a money question,” said Angela Stuesse, author of  “Scratching Out a Living: Latinos, Race, and Work in the Deep South,” based on years of ethnographic research in Mississippi’s poultry region.
Exposed to hazards
Ninety-one severe injuries were reported in Mississippi’s poultry plants in the last 10 years, and 35 workers suffered amputations. Poultry workers nationally suffer occupational injuries and illnesses six times more often than other workers, according to 2016 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But the prevalence of injuries in the industry is not a natural consequence of handling dangerous machines, tools or chemicals. Berkowitz argues it is the result of companies purposefully cutting corners to save money.
“All injuries are preventable,” she said. “It’s all about profits, and they’re making huge profits.”
Tyson Foods, the biggest chicken producer in the U.S., reported $16.4 billion in chicken sales in 2024. 
The sanitation shift, which takes place at night and is mostly staffed by undocumented workers, is the most dangerous, Berkowitz says. Workers clean the blood and guts out of machines, using high pressure hoses and corrosive chemicals. But some poultry companies use sanitation subcontractors to clean their plants, escaping some liability for what happens on the shift.
“This is really a way to outsource their obligation to protect workers,” Berkowitz said.
Although company employees still oversee operations, subcontractors are responsible for hiring workers and providing them adequate equipment and training.
Quality Service Integrity, a sanitation company contracted by Tyson Foods, was fined $10,000 in June 2024 for making workers pay to replace their damaged protective equipment, like chemical suits and safety glasses, in a Tyson plant in Carthage – a violation of OSHA standards. 
The same investigation also found that the plant did not have an infirmary or a person trained to perform first aid.
Baldomero Orozco, an employee with a work permit who cleaned Tyson’s Carthage plant at night, had filed a complaint against Quality Service Integrity to OSHA before the inspection.
“We have strict policies in place across all facilities to ensure full compliance with all applicable workplace regulations,” a Tyson Foods spokesperson told Mississippi Today in a statement. Quality Service Integrity did not reply to a request for comment.

The same year, Orozco filed another complaint against Peco Foods in Sebastopol, his previous employer, claiming they charged him for tools and other equipment required for the job. He told Mississippi Today he spent roughly $150 on tools alone. 
“The company didn’t take responsibility for anything for us,” he said. “We had to buy our tools, the wrenches, everything you use to remove a screw.”
Peco Foods had previously been fined $6,000 in May 2023 for failing to replace workers’ equipment at no cost.

Enforcement failures
Occasional citations might be one-time victories for workers, but Orozco says they do not lead to long-term improvement.
“When OSHA came by, things did calm down, more or less. But after a couple days, the same things started happening, because OSHA never followed up on the case,” he said.
Quality Service Integrity’s operations with Tyson in Carthage have not been inspected again since the citation was issued.
OSHA’s data reveals that inspections in Mississippi’s poultry plants are scarce. Tyson Foods plants were not inspected for four years before Orozco’s filing. Koch Foods was inspected twice in the past five years.
A report published by a federation of labor unions in April stated it would take 243 years for Mississippi’s seven OSHA inspectors to visit every workplace once.
“Most workplaces never see OSHA unless a complaint is filed, or a worker is killed, or there are very serious injuries that are reported,” Berkowitz said in an email.
Nine of the 20 inspections performed by OSHA in Mississippi’s poultry plants in the past five years were initiated by a worker complaint. Mar-Jac poultry plants were inspected three times following the death of a worker in three years – and fined $163,759 in 2023 after the death of a 16 year-old on the job.
“OSHA’s top priority for inspection is an imminent danger –- a situation where workers face an immediate risk of death or serious physical harm,” a Department of Labor spokesperson said. Second priority goes to fatalities or accidents where three or more workers are hospitalized. Employee complaints come next, the spokesperson said. 
OSHA typically does not give advance notice of an inspection, except in certain specific situations. But when OSHA inspectors come unannounced, plant managers can refuse to let them in and ask them to come back with a warrant.

Maria, who resigned from her job at Peco Foods in Sebastopol after she broke her spine in a car accident in December 2022, is unable to work today. Because she got injured on her way to work, she was eligible for workers’ compensation. But she never claimed it, in fear of upsetting her employer.
“I was scared,” she said. “What if they call the police or ICE on me?”
Awaiting surgery in hopes of getting fully back on her feet, Maria struggles to make ends meet for herself and the three children she’s raising alone. 
“I don’t have a work permit, I’m just another immigrant, but I fight. I fight every day to raise my children. I don’t depend on the government,” she said.

The records show nearly 4 in 10 of the roughly 2,000 doctors offered jobs from January through March of this year turned them down. That is quadruple the rate of doctors rejecting offers during the same time period last year.The VA in March said it intended to cut its workforce by at least 70,000 people. The news sparked alarm that the cuts would hurt patient care, prompting public reassurances from VA Secretary Doug Collins that front-line health care staff would be immune from the proposed layoffs.Last month, department officials updated their plans and said they would reduce the workforce by 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30. So many staffers had left voluntarily, the agency said in a press release, that mass layoffs would not be necessary.“VA is headed in the right direction,” Collins said in a statement.But a review of hundreds of internal staffing records, along with interviews with veterans and employees, reveal a far less rosy picture of how staffing is affecting veterans’ care.After six years of adding medical staff, the VA this year is down more than 600 doctors and about 1,900 nurses. The number of doctors on staff has declined each month since President Donald Trump took office. The agency also lost twice as many nurses as it hired between January and June, records viewed by ProPublica show.In response to questions, a VA spokesperson did not dispute numbers about staff losses at centers across the country but accused ProPublica of bias and of “cherry-picking issues that are mostly routine.”Agency spokesperson Peter Kasperowicz said that the department is “working to address” the number of doctors declining job offers by speeding up the hiring process and that the agency “has several strategies to navigate shortages,” including referring veterans to private providers and telehealth appointments. A nationwide shortage of health care workers has made hiring and retention difficult, he said.Kasperowicz said that the recent changes at the agency have not compromised care and that wait times are getting better after worsening under President Joe Biden.While wait times for primary, mental health and specialty care for existing patients did increase during Biden’s presidency, the VA’s statistics show only slight reductions since Trump took office in January.However, appointment wait times for new patients seeking primary and specialty care have slightly increased, according to a report obtained by ProPublica.As of early July, the average wait time nationally to schedule outpatient surgery appointments for new patients was 41 days, which is 13 days higher than the goal set by the VA and nearly two days longer than a year ago.In some locations, the waits for appointments are even longer.At the Togus VA Medical Center in Augusta, Maine, internal records show that there is a two-month wait for primary care appointments, which is triple the VA’s goal and 38 days longer than it was at this time last year. The wife of a disabled Marine veteran who receives care at the facility told ProPublica that it has become harder in recent months to schedule appointments and to get timely care.Her husband, she said, served in Somalia and is completely disabled. He has not had a primary care doctor assigned to him for months after his previous doctor left over the winter, she said.“He has no person who is in charge of his health care,” said the woman, who did not want to be named because of fears her comments might affect benefits for her husband. “It was never like this before. There’s a lack of staff, empty rooms, locked doors. It feels like something that’s not healthy.”Kasperowicz said the VA is taking “aggressive action” to recruit primary care doctors in Maine and anticipates hiring two new doctors by the end of the year.Nationwide, records reviewed by ProPublica show, the vacancy rate for doctors at the VA was 13.7% in May, up from 12% in May of 2024. Kasperowicz said those rates are in line with historical averages for the agency. But while the vacancy rate decreased over the first five months of 2024, it has risen in 2025.Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who has been critical of Collins’ stewardship, has argued that the VA is heading in a dangerous new direction. He said that ProPublica’s findings reinforce his concerns about “damaging and dangerous impacts” from cuts and staffing reductions.“Dedicated professionals are fleeing — and recruitment is flagging — because of toxic work conditions and draconian funding cuts and firings,” he told ProPublica. “We’ve warned repeatedly about these results — shocking, but not surprising.”In the VA’s Texas region, which covers most of the state, officials reported in an internal presentation in June that approximately 90 people had turned down job offers “due to the uncertainty of reorganization” and noted that low morale was causing existing employees to not recommend working at the medical centers.Anthony Martinez, a retired Army captain who did tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he has witnessed a downgrade in care at the Temple, Texas, VA facility. He said that the hospital has lost records of his recent allergy shots, which he now has to repeat, and he has to wait longer for appointments.“Problems have always existed but not to this degree,” Martinez said.Martinez, who runs a local nonprofit for veterans, said he’s heard similar frustrations from many of them. “It’s not just me. Many vets are having bad experiences,” he said.Kasperowicz said the agency couldn’t discuss Martinez’s case without a patient privacy waiver, which Martinez declined to sign. He said wait times for primary care appointments for existing patients at Temple are unchanged over the past fiscal year. But internal records show an increase in wait times for new patients in specialties such as cardiology, gastroenterology and oncology.Administrators there have expressed concern about the impact of staff losses, warning in their June internal presentation about “institutional knowledge leaving the Agency due to the increase of supervisors departing.”It is not just the loss of doctors and nurses impacting care. Shortages in support staff, who have not been protected from cuts, are also adding to delays.In Dayton, Ohio, vacant positions for purchasing agents resulted in delays in acquiring hundreds of prosthetics, according to an internal VA report from May. Kasperowicz said the hospital has recently cut processing time for such orders by more than half.Some facilities are experiencing trouble hiring and keeping mental health staff.In February, a human resources official in the VA region covering much of Florida reported in an internal warning system that the area was having trouble hiring mental health professionals to treat patients in rural areas. The jobs had previously been entirely remote but now require providers to be on site at a clinic.When the region offered jobs to three mental health providers, all of them declined. The expected impact, according to the warning document, was longer delays for appointments. Kasperowicz said the VA is working to address the shortages.Yet even as the agency faces these challenges, the Trump administration has dramatically scaled back the use of a key tool designed to help the VA attract applicants and plug gaps in critical front-line care.The VA in recent years has used incentive payments to help recruit and keep doctors and other health care workers. In fiscal 2024, the agency paid nearly 20,000 staffers retention bonuses and over 6,000 new hires got signing bonuses. In the first nine months of this fiscal year, which started Oct. 1, only about 8,000 VA employees got retention bonuses and just over 1,000 received recruitment incentives. The VA has told lawmakers it has been able to fill jobs without using the incentive programs.Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., said during a congressional oversight hearing in July that the Trump administration is withholding the bonuses because it “wants them to leave” as part of a plan to privatize services.“It’s not that VA employees are less meritorious than they were under Biden,” she said. “They want every employee to be pushed out so they can decimate the VA’s workforce.”Do you have information about the VA that we should know about?

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach says he keeps a box of naloxone in his pickup truck.
It’s a lifesaving tool that can fit in the glovebox, and Kobach wants to make the product more accessible to Kansans.
Naloxone, also known by the brand name Narcan, is an overdose-reversal medication that can restore someone’s breathing within minutes and is known for its effectiveness in combating the opioid epidemic.
A state grant review board unanimously approved Friday a $177,000 grant for the Attorney General’s Office to transform unused news racks into naloxone distribution boxes.
“If you’re willing to keep it in your glovebox in your car, you should be doing that, because we need it distributed everywhere to potentially save lives,” Kobach said at a Friday meeting of the Kansas Fights Addiction Grant Review Board.
The idea was inspired by Emily’s Hope, an organization in South Dakota that says it was the first in the nation to repurpose news racks to increase access to naloxone and reduce the stigma around drug use. The program has been “extremely successful,” said Angela Kennecke, president and CEO of Emily’s Hope. Since April, the organization has established 25 open boxes in 11 cities, and it is working on 12 more. That has amounted to roughly 8,200 kits distributed.
“I thought we should be doing the same thing,” Kobach said.
He wants to place repurposed newspaper boxes on college and university campuses, of which there are about 40 in Kansas.
Kobach’s request focused on illegally made fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that caused more than half of overdose deaths in 2023 in Kansas, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kansas recently surpassed 1,500 total deaths from fentanyl, he said. Of the 615 overdose deaths in Kansas in 2023, nearly 60% had at least one potential opportunity for intervention, the data said. In almost 45% of deaths, a bystander was present.
Pat George, the board chair, said the overdose crisis is happening now.
“Our primary mission, I’ve always felt, is saving lives and saving families, so this fits right in,” George said.
The addiction grant review board is charged with deciding where to allocate the millions of dollars that have poured into the state from settlements with pharmaceutical companies, which were sued for playing a part in the opioid epidemic. Kansas has received $90 million to date, said Shanna Zimmer, chief financial officer of the Sunflower Foundation, a nonprofit that administers the funds for the state. About $74 million remains in the bank.
The attorney general envisioned the grant paying for public service announcements, social media and video advertising, distribution boxes and 7,000 boxes of naloxone, each typically containing two doses. The majority of the grant, about $150,000, will be for advertising, Kobach said.
Education is a significant piece, he said, because of the pervasive nature of fentanyl. It appears in counterfeit pills, often mixed with other drugs.
A Douglas County-based social services organization, DCCCA, runs the Kansas Naloxone Program. It has placed five vending machines across the state that distribute naloxone like bags of chips or candy bars. Three more are on the way, said Chrissy Mayer, chief community-based services officer for DCCCA.
Between October and June, the organization distributed about 40,000 kits of naloxone across Kansas, either through vending machines or by mail. That’s 80,000 doses.
“We know that overdoses continue to increase, and this is a really easy way to save someone’s life,” Mayer said.

The organization places boxes at locations in Hutchinson, Lawrence, Kansas City, Kansas, Salina and Wichita, based on data mapping overdose hotspots. New machines are expected soon in Garden City, Overland Park and Pittsburg.
People who want naloxone from one of DCCCA’s machines enter their zip code on a keypad, then the machine dispenses a kit, Mayer said. The machine in Wichita is typically restocked weekly. In Hutchinson, it’s restocked about every two weeks, and the rest are usually restocked once a month.
Mayer said “there are some interesting assumptions that people might make” regarding who uses the vending machines. Many who use the vending machines are from what might be classified as more affluent ZIP codes, she said.
“That just demonstrates opioid overdose affects everybody,” Mayer said.
She added: “Your ZIP code doesn’t really matter.”
DCCCA offers multiple training options on its website for the proper administration of naloxone.

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen. 


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Two-term Rep. Craig Haggard, of Mooresville, will formally announce his campaign for the 4th congressional district tomorrow, Aug. 12, in Plainfield during a Constitutional Oath Rally at Hummel Park. His district includes portions of Hendricks, Johnson and Morgan counties.

VP Vance meets with Indiana GOP leadership on redistricting; Democrats denounce effort

The 4th congressional district, currently held by U.S. Rep. Jim Baird, stretches from Martinsville — southwest of Indianapolis — at its southern tip up past Lafayette to DeMotte, which is south of Gary, sharing much of its western border with Illinois.
Baird hasn’t yet announced whether not he’ll run in 2026, though Haggard has openly questioned whether Baird has tried to prop up his son, Beau Baird, as his successor in the district. Haggard also floated the possibility of a run in 2024, opting against it when Baird announced his reelection campaign.
However, the possibility of mid-cycle redistricting could fundamentally alter the direction of any 2026 congressional campaigns — even potentially drawing Haggard’s Mooresville home out of the 4th district. Technically, congressmen don’t have to live in the district they represent.
Seeking to grow his historically slim Republican majority in Congress, President Donald Trump has pressured GOP-led states to redistrict ahead of the traditional timeline to grow his party’s control. Democratic states have vowed to retaliate, potentially disrupting maps nationwide.
Republicans seeking to weaken the Democratic hold over the 7th congressional district in Indianapolis may mean redrawing the boundary to include Hoosiers in the redder doughnut counties, such as Haggard’s Mooresville hometown. Sitting U.S. Rep. André Carson has said he will run for reelection wherever his district’s new boundaries may be — but adding the residents of Indianapolis may dilute some of the ruby red districts elsewhere in the state.
Additionally, the 4th district adjoins the 1st district, another Democratic seat targeted by Republicans. It’s unclear if Hoosier Republicans will bow to Trump and redistrict the state, but doing so would transform the district Haggard seeks to win.
In response to questions about redistricting, Haggard iterated his belief in the district’s conservative bend, saying he didn’t think there was an “appetite for redistricting.”
“Indiana is a solid Republican state, It has voted for Trump 3 times already and I think proof of Indiana being conservative is our super majority. I have been hearing from constituents and I do not believe at this time there is an appetite for redistricting in our communities. I still plan on running in the 4th regardless, where I have met with tens of thousands of voters the last two years and where I plan to represent them in Congress if I am elected,” Haggard said.

The nonprofit was founded to mend the historical rift caused by enslavement, as well as to address the ensuing human rights violations and culture of white supremacy. 
Through community networking and collaboration, the organization seeks to facilitate reparations through a faith-based model. The Justice League’s president and co-founder Prince Solace explained that the Reparations Fund comprises payments from churches and individuals in Greater Lansing, as well as donations from Black advocates.

Solace added that these scholarships– and the Reparations Fund from which they’re sourced– are the product of “intergenerational and cross-racial and cross-denominational support stemming primarily from Greater Lansing, but also from beyond our community.”
 “Centuries of systemic inequalities in the U.S. have strongly negatively affected African Americans’ ability to accumulate wealth and have created a racial wealth gap,” Willye Bryan,  the Justice League’s vice president and co-founder, said.  “The social and financial cost to Black Americans continues to be great. The time to address these disparities is now.”

Applicants were asked to discuss these disparities in their essays, examining how they and their families have been impacted by the gaps in racial or generational wealth. 
Indeed, for many of the winners, the scholarship offered not only a means of reparation, but recognition of their own hardships, histories, and hopes. 
“Economically, the [racial wealth] gap means that I move through life with far less ease than wealth provides,” Corinne Williams Hough, a student at East Lansing High School, said. “Wealth creates a soft landing, a margin of error, a set of options. It provides breathing room, a buffer that allows people to imagine, explore, and sometimes even fail without losing too much ground. As I get older, I realize that is not a luxury I have been given.”
Similarly, Malachi Turner of Lansing delved into the history of financial discrimination— particularly policies like redlining. 
“I was shocked to learn how these practices still affect communities today,” Turner explained. “Through conversations with my parents, I began to see how systemic inequality continues to shape the lives of families who are still trying to catch up economically.”
For recipient Talia Dunn, these realities have been a motivating force.
“These challenges have made me more aware and resilient, and I am determined to break the cycle,” she said.

Progressives and voting rights advocates are divided on whether California and New York should fight the Texas power grab by gerrymandering their own states, creating more safe Democratic seats, even if that means undermining fair maps and the authority of those states’ nonpartisan redistricting commissions.
In Wisconsin, which just got out from under one of the worst partisan gerrymanders in the U.S., and the impenetrable, outsized Republican majorities in the state Legislature it protected for a decade and a half, this issue hits particularly close to home.
It’s head-spinning to hear arguments for Democratic counter-gerrymandering in other states from the same people in Wisconsin who were recently crying out for fair maps.
If Democrats are going to mount a serious challenge to the fascist takeover of our country by Trump and his minions, it’s hard to see how ceding the moral high ground and running roughshod over the principle that the will of the majority of voters should prevail is going to help.










If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law.


I get that it’s more satisfying to imagine a quick fix to the fascist takeover of every branch of government than to listen to a lot of vague talk about long-term plans to rebuild democracy. After all, election deniers and the architects of the Jan. 6 attack are now running the federal government, demanding access to voter lists across the country and deploying the FBI to arrest political opponents, including the Texas Democrats who’ve fled their state to stall the gerrymandering scheme there.
But here in Wisconsin, where we’ve just finally beaten back the most gerrymandered map in the country, it’s depressing to imagine Democrats abandoning the high ground and scrambling to do exactly what Republicans did when they controlled all three branches of government, attempting to lock in permanent political control against the will of the people.
If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law.
In this most extreme political moment, with every public institution and the continued existence of U.S. democracy in doubt, I understand why the long view frustrates people. The emergency is now. I understand that many voters want to see Democrats “fight fire with fire,” as Newsom put it.
But consider this: Republicans control more state legislatures (28 Republican versus 18 controlled by Democrats) and have trifecta control of all branches of government in more states (23 all-GOP states versus 15 all-Democratic). JD Vance just launched a tour of Republican states to encourage more mid-decade gerrymandering. And Trump wants to hold a new census for the purpose of redefining who can vote. Even if Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom and Kathy Hochul succeed in gerrymandering California and New York, Democrats are not likely to win the nationwide redistricting war.
Meanwhile, democracy will be the first casualty of that war. California and New York would have to suspend the work of their nonpartisan redistricting commissions — the gold standard for fair, nonpartisan map-drawing — and take back partisan control of the process in order to carry out their threats. If they succeed, it is beyond unlikely that the politicians who pull off that short-term victory will ever cede back their power over the voting maps to the nonpartisan commissions again.
On a deeper level, the Democratic gerrymandering fantasy takes the whole movement to oppose Trump in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of building grassroots support to counter an unpopular, authoritarian leader, it rigs the system to benefit a party whose whole problem is that it has lost the broad, popular support it needs to win elections and create a better, more enlightened government.
Instead of trying to rig the maps to ensure a Democratic House majority in the next election, Democrats need to focus on winning elections and flipping seats in areas of the rural and industrial Midwest that were once reliably blue but have turned deep red.
To do that they need to make the case that health care, education and an adequate social safety net are bedrock rights in the richest nation on earth, and that we should not be giving tax breaks to billionaires by taking food out of the mouths of hungry children.
They need to offer something to the farmers and factory workers and disaffected voters in rural and urban areas alike that is clearly different and better than the hate, corruption, and a determination to run roughshod over democracy that Republicans offer.
In Wisconsin, voting rights groups have been working on a campaign to push through a constitutional amendment modeled on one in our neighboring state of Michigan, to make sure that our voting maps are never again drawn up by partisan legislators.
That’s the kind of grassroots fight that helped Wisconsin finally overcome Republican gerrymandering. One important aspect of the fair maps movement is the way it engaged citizens to feel like participants, not spectators, in democracy, and to find their common interests instead of focusing on the politics of division. This, not more politicians in safe seats who don’t have to listen to voters, is what we need right now.
The battle to beat back fascism does not turn on a handful of Democrats in protected districts. It turns on an organized uprising by the majority of people in the U.S. who are willing to join together despite their differences because they are sick and tired of having their democracy stolen from them, along with their health, safety, opportunity and hope. There’s no short cut to leading that fight.

The Rutgers Board of Governors on Monday approved the hiring of former LSU Chief Administrative Officer Kimberly Lewis for the same position at their university. The board also approved the hiring of Keena Arbuthnot as executive vice president for academic affairs. Arbuthnot is currently dean of LSU’s graduate school. 
Late last month, it was announced Tate would hire Keli Zinn, LSU’s executive deputy athletics director and chief operating officer as Rutgers’ new athletic director. 
Additionally, Louis Gremillion, LSU assistant vice president for government relations, will become Rutgers’ associate vice president for advancement and special assistant to the president. 
Before joining LSU in 2021, Lewis served as revenue secretary under former Gov. John Bel Edwards and had worked for two other Democratic governors. She was among a slew of top administrators who left LSU earlier this year. 
Lewis’ resignation letter indicated she was asked to leave her position. She was replaced on an interim basis by Tommy Smith. 
Arbuthnot was appointed dean of LSU’s Pinkie Gordon Lane Graduate School in 2024. LSU spokesman Todd Woodward said an interim dean will likely be chosen this week. 
Any interim administrators will not be considered for permanent positions until the LSU Board of Supervisors hires a replacement for Tate, who announced his departure for Rutgers in May and left Baton Rouge in June. 
The first meeting of LSU’s presidential search committee is scheduled for Aug. 19.

John Eastman says high court should hear matter “because it affects so much private property.”
The post Attorney who backed Trump on Jan. 6 now urging Supreme Court to hear corner-crossing case appeared first on WyoFile .","An attorney widely known for his involvement in President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election told WyoFile on Sunday why he will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider Fred Eshelman’s failed corner-crossing lawsuit.
John Eastman, an attorney well-practiced in Supreme Court cases and perhaps most famous for joining Rudy Giuliani on stage at the Jan. 6, 2021, “Save America” rally in Washington, D.C., explained his reasoning in an email. 
“The decision [by the 10th Circuit] effectively takes an easement on private property without compensation, in violation of the Takings Clause of the Constitution,” Eastman wrote WyoFile. “That, and because it affects so much private property, makes it an extremely important case for the Supreme Court to review.”
“We know there was fraud … “we know dead people voted.” John Eastman
The U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled earlier this year that four hunters did not trespass on Eshelman’s ranch after corner crossing to hunt on public land surrounded by Eshelman’s property. The wealthy North Carolina resident and owner of Carbon County’s Elk Mountain Ranch petitioned the Supreme Court to take up the case.
The hunters never set foot on Eshelman’s land, but did pass through the airspace above his property. The businessman sued the hunters in civil court to stop them from corner crossing.
In his petition for a writ of certiorari, Eshelman’s attorneys said the 10th Circuit ruling “steamrolls state law, takes easements, and revolutionizes property law affecting up to 150 million acres of private land.” Some 2.4 million acres of public land in Wyoming and 8.3 million acres nationwide would be “corner locked” and inaccessible if corner crossing is ruled illegal, according to the digital mapping company onX.
Conservative think tank
“[W]e plan to file an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Claremont Institute Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence in support of the petition for writ of certiorari in the above-referenced matter,” Eastman wrote hunters’ attorney Ryan Semerad on Friday.  
Semerad provided a copy of the email after a request from WyoFile. He has said the Supreme Court does not need to take up the issue, and the 10th Circuit decision should stand.
Eshelman alleged three Missouri men trespassed in 2020 and four in 2021 to hunt near his roughly 22,000-acre ranch. The hunters stepped only on public land when hunting on federal, state and municipal property surrounded by Eshelman’s Elk Mountain Ranch.
The legal fight emerged from the checkerboard landscape of alternating public-private square-mile sections in southern Wyoming. The pattern is a relic of the railroad grant era of the 1800s and covers a swath of the state, 40 miles wide and about 200 miles long.

Hunters Bradly Cape, Phillip Yeomans, John Slowensky and Zachary Smith successfully fought Eshelman’s suit — and misdemeanor criminal charges — arguing they were protected by the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act. That law seeks to preserve public access to public land in the West.
The 10th Circuit decision that the hunters did not trespass applies to Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Utah and parts of Yellowstone National Park in Montana and Idaho. A ruling from the Supreme Court would institute legal uniformity across the country.
Briefs due Monday
Eastman and others who want to inform the Supreme Court whether it should hear Eshelman’s appeal are scheduled to file their opinions by Aug. 18. The Wyoming Stock Growers Association, the Wyoming Wool Growers Association, the Montana Stockgrowers Association and United Property Owners of Montana have indicated that they will join the fray.
The court on Friday granted the hunters an extension. They now have until  Sept. 17 to file their rebuttal.
Eastman’s conservative Claremont Institute is a think tank and advocacy group whose mission is “to restore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, preeminent authority in our national life.” The group’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, of which Eastman is the founding director, fights to uphold property rights, among other things.
Eastman is a member of the Bar of the Supreme Court, according to his email letterhead. He has represented more than 20 parties in front of the Supreme Court and represented amici curiae in more than 100 cases in that venue, according to his bio on the Claremont Institute website.
He was a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas from 1996 to 1997, according to his bio.
Chapman University honored him for faculty excellence in scholarly and creative activity (2013), Franciscan University gave him the St. Thomas More Award (2010) and the J. Reuben Clark Society of Orange County gave him the J. Reuben Clark Award (2010), Eastman’s bio states.
2020 presidential election
Eastman is widely known for his role in advocating that then-Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to challenge states’ electoral votes that gave Joe Biden the victory in the 2020 election. At the Jan. 6, 2021 “Save America” rally on the Ellipse with Giuliani, he championed unproven allegations of voter fraud.
“We know there was fraud,” he said, “we know dead people voted.”
Shortly thereafter, rioters stormed the Capitol.
Eastman’s actions tangled him in a cobweb of legal trouble. The State Bar of California in 2023 charged him with 11 disciplinary counts alleging he planned, promoted and assisted Trump’s alleged strategy to overturn the 2020 election results. The California Bar had earlier warned it was investigating Eastman for “moral turpitude, dishonesty, and corruption.”
The Department of Justice and the State of Georgia indicted Eastman for his role in the 2020 election. Judge Tanya Chutkan dismissed the federal action, and the Georgia cases have been paused.
Eastman lists his California and Washington, D.C. licenses to practice law “temporarily inactive.” He has challenged the California charges and asked, unsuccessfully, that his license be reactivated.

In north Jackson’s Broadmoor neighborhood early Saturday morning, Buck and more than a dozen volunteers, mostly women, drilled away at fresh lumber, laid glue and lifted frames, following the blueprints for Buck’s future home.
Hopefully by the new year, she will be crossing the threshold of her new house built by Habitat for Humanity, something the 32-year-old has been waiting for since she first applied last fall. 
“ I’m getting nervous because I’m fixing to be on my own,” Buck said. “I’ve never been on my own.”
Buck isn’t new to the Habitat for Humanity model for homeownership. Her mother purchased her first home from Habitat for Humanity in 1999, and they’ve been living in Jackson’s Midtown neighborhood nearly her entire life. She said that by buying a home on her own, she’s taking a leap of independence. Buck has three children and wants to set an example. 
“ I want to learn how to be responsible so I can show my kids how to learn to be responsible and not to depend on somebody else,” she said.
Choosing to build in Jackson wasn’t a hard decision for her, she said. She wants to remain close to her mother and keep her children at the same schools.
“This is my home. I know the crime and stuff is bad, but this still is my home,” Buck said. “I love Jackson. I was born and raised here, and I don’t want to leave Jackson.”

Merrill McKewen, CEO of Habitat for Humanity Mississippi Capital Area, said that one of the missions of the nonprofit organization is to improve the living conditions for families and create successful homeowners. Habitat operates in the Hinds, Madison and Rankin counties, and since its formation nearly 40 years ago, it has built more than 660 homes. 
“Every morning at least 2,500 people wake up in a safe, decent, affordable house because of Habitat,” McKewen said. 
This work means transforming blighted properties and empty lots and offering 30-year, zero interest mortgages on them. McKewen stresses that Habitat for Humanity is an economic engine and doesn’t give homes away for free. Homeowners spend up to 80 working on their home and at least 125 “sweat equity” hours volunteering.
“It’s a passion to help my brothers and sisters in Christ get a chance to fulfill a dream. It’s something that they qualified for, worked for, and that they take the responsibility for. That’s why it’s a hand up, not a handout,” McKewen said.
She said it’s rare that a homeowner faces foreclosure and has to move, but it happens.
“My saddest day on the job is when I have to go stand in court in front of a judge to have them evicted, or sometimes they just abandon the house,” she said. “As tragic as that is, we then take the house, refresh it, bring it up to the standards of which we’re building now, and sell it to another qualified Habitat homeowner.”
In recent years, Habitat for Humanity has built 28 houses in the Broadmoor neighborhood where Buck will live, and McKewen said the work will continue. Placing Habitat builds in the community encourages neighbors to invest into their own homes. She hopes that impact can be felt for generations to come.
“I would like to buy 15 blighted properties or receive them if people bless us. If we could get 15 properties in the Broadmoor area, we could probably get close to the commitment I made pre-COVID, which was to impact 100 houses in the area,” McKewen said.
In building her first house, Buck said she hopes to impart a legacy for her children. She wants them to grow and thrive in the city that she loves, all while living in a safe neighborhood. She already imagines herself on her porch or watching her children play at the nearby park. 
“This will be my property in 30 years that I can call my home,” Buck said. “This is going to be mine, and I could leave it for my kids if they want it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/09205806/IMG_5796.jpg,,,2025-08-11 10:57:36.988383

(Photo courtesy of Andrea Lonas/Jobs for the Future)A nonprofit plans to ask four states to participate in a $19.5 million initiative aimed at transforming how people transition from prison to the workforce.
The Fair Chance to Advance initiative, led by the national nonprofit Jobs for the Future, hopes to provide funding and support over four years to help states expand access to postsecondary education in prison and strengthen connections to employment after release.
The new initiative comes as state prison systems across the country continue to launch and expand education and work training programs. With the restoration and expansion of federal Pell Grant eligibility to incarcerated students in July 2023, the U.S. Department of Education estimated then that 760,000 people were newly eligible for federal financial aid — fueling interest in prison education efforts.
‘Transformative’: More college programs are slowly coming into prisons

But that momentum has not always been enough to connect formerly incarcerated people to well-paying jobs and opportunities that align with their qualifications — even for those who have earned advanced degrees — due to systemic barriers such as employer bias and restrictive occupational licensing requirements.
“What’s been the missing piece is making sure that those pathways are connected to quality jobs,” said Rebecca Villarreal, the senior director in the Center for Justice and Economic Advancement at Jobs for the Future.
Approximately 77 million U.S. adults, or about 1 in 3, have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and can face persistent barriers to securing education, employment, housing and other basic resources after incarceration.
States can apply for the program; full proposals are due in October. Each of the four participating states chosen will represent a different U.S. Census region, according to Villarreal. Each state is expected to receive funding, technical assistance and access to a national peer learning network as part of a two-phase process beginning in February 2026.
A key goal of the initiative, Villarreal said, is to make education and workforce training acquired during incarceration more visible and transferable to employers. The program also aims to ensure that prison-based education and work training align with in-demand occupations and the broader labor market needs of each participating state.
As part of the initiative, participating states also will collect data to track post-incarceration education and employment outcomes.

States have led the way in regulating kratom, and now federal officials want to ban 7-OH, a powerful compound found in some kratom products. (Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher McCurdy, University of Florida professor of medicinal chemistry


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.


In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Aug. 8, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceFollowing years of legal back and forth, attorneys for the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, and a host of environmental groups and agricultural industry representatives, met on Friday to discuss whether to move forward with tighter restrictions on industrial livestock farming. 
EGLE offered a new general permit for regulating concentrated animal feeding operations in 2020, updating provisions from its previous 2015 permit including regulations on how animal waste is applied as fertilizer.
While the department is required to issue new permits every five years, the  2020 permit never went into effect due to several challenges from agricultural industry groups. 
The Michigan Supreme Court determined in 2024 that EGLE had not violated administrative rulemaking procedures when issuing new requirements on the amount of phosphorus that can be applied to land and revising setback requirements for where these feeding operations can apply livestock waste. 
However, Administrative Law Judge Daniel Pulter stripped out several provisions earlier this year as part of the contested case hearing on the new permit.
  Zachary Larsen, an attorney representing several agricultural industry groups, opposed additional measures proposed by environmental interests to more tightly regulate how confined animal feeding operations apply their waste to agricultural fields.

In a discussion with EGLE Director Phil Roos, attorneys representing the agency’s Water Resources Division and representatives from the Environmental Law and Policy Center offered several suggestions on how the permit could be strengthened, advising Roos to restore provisions Pulter removed.
“EGLE is ready to move forward under a new permit, instead of being stuck for more than a decade under the insufficiently protective 2015 general permit,” Assistant Attorney General Elizabeth Morrisseau, who represented the Water Resources Division, said, adding that she hoped the agricultural groups felt the same way. 
A 2024 report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center notes waste from large scale animal feed operations often contain substances that can harm the environment, including detergents, antibiotics, PFAS and pathogens like E. coli.
When livestock waste is overapplied and misapplied, nutrients like phosphorus can runoff into water sources, leading to harmful algal blooms.
Nitrates, another nutrient found in feeding operation waste, also pose a risk to groundwater and have been linked to birth defects, miscarriage, blue baby syndrome and cancer.
“For the past five years because of these legal challenges, the untreated sewage generated by [concentrated animal feeding operations] has been subject to a failing 10 year old permit, and that delay has had consequences. In just the two years from 2022 to 2024, an additional 583 waters in Michigan have been deemed impaired due to E. coli, phosphorus or other nutrients.” Katie Garvey, senior attorney for the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said.

In order to avert these harms Morrisseau offered three recommendations: 

Banning wintertime land application of animal waste, save for the last two weeks of March 
Allow permit writers to craft additional conditions when issuing certificates of coverage to large scale animal farms operating and disposing waste in watersheds subject to total maximum daily load conditions, which determine how much pollution a lake or stream can absorb in order to comply with state water quality standards
Adding the following provisions stripped out by Pulter’s ruling. 

A definition of the term “operational control” over manure
Individual groundwater monitoring requirements
Individual land application reporting requirements



While the Environmental Law and Policy Center agreed with EGLE’s recommendations, the organization offered recommendations of their own, including:

A full ban on winter application and the sale, gift or transfer of animal feeding operation waste through March 31 and on frozen or snow-covered ground at any other time
Additional requirements on the sale, gift or transfer of animal feeding operation waste, to help EGLE can track where this waste is being applied
Requiring the use of the Michigan Phosphorus Risk Assessment when applying manure
Banning the application of waste from animal feeding operations on tile-drained fields, which drain into nearby surface waters
Requiring additional testing of discharge from tile drains
Revising waste storage capacity calculation guidelines

Zachary Larsen, representing the Michigan Farm Bureau and several other agricultural industry groups, argued many of the requests from EGLE and the Environmental Law and Policy Center fell outside of the department’s legal authority, and that the Roos should avoid modifying Pulter’s decision. 
He also raised due process concerns, pointing to a 2024 executive order from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer which eliminated the Environmental Permitting Review Committee giving EGLE’s director or their designee the authority to hear permit review appeals and make decisions on permit application review petitions. 
“For those five years, EGLE pursued this litigation both in court and in front of the administrative body, and doubtlessly did so with the knowledge and approval of the agency’s leadership. Now EGLE staff is asking the same leadership to overturn much of the independent [administrative law judge’s] decision,” Larsen said. 
During the public comment period several Michigan residents discussed their experiences living near concentrated animal feeding operations, sharing grievances ranging from foul smells in the area to the contamination of their well water. 
Sydney Howard, speaking on behalf of FLOW Water advocates, said communities with higher poverty rates were correlated with areas where confined animal feeding operations were more likely to spread their manure, particularly in central Michigan, calling it a case of “textbook environmental justice.”
At the conclusion of the more than four-hour long hearing, Roos moved the meeting into closed session to consult with his attorney. Upon resuming, he declined to make a final determination on the permit, promising to schedule another meeting date.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4408-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 10:57:36.988383

Rosa DeLauro is having the spinal surgery while Congress is on recess and plans to keep up her schedule during physical therapy.,"U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, is undergoing surgery Monday to treat spinal stenosis, according to her office.
Dr. Judith L. Gorelick, a board-certified neurosurgeon, will perform the surgery at Griffin Hospital in Derby. The doctor called the procedure “a common treatment for a common occurrence.”
DeLauro’s office said the congresswoman will go to physical therapy after the procedure to help with recovery. DeLauro, 82, will pick her work schedule back up during her treatment.
She is having the surgery while Congress is on a month-long recess through August. Her office said she will return to Washington, D.C., after Labor Day with the rest of Congress. 
The Mayo Clinic describes spinal stenosis as a condition where the spaces in the backbone are too small. It is a more common diagnosis in people who are over 50.
Some people have no symptoms, but others may feel pain, tingling, numbness or muscle weakness. For many people diagnosed with spinal stenosis, it mostly occurs in the lower back or neck.
“The most common cause of spinal stenosis is wear-and-tear damage in the spine related to arthritis,” according to the Mayo Clinic. “People who have serious spinal stenosis may need surgery.”
Surgery can create more space and ease some of the symptoms caused by spinal stenosis. But if someone has arthritis, surgery cannot cure it, so pain in the spine attributed to that may not go away.
When she returns to Washington, D.C., in September, DeLauro and other congressional appropriators will be working on a quick deadline to fund the federal government. Funding runs out on Sept. 30.
She is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee and will help negotiate spending bills, though lawmakers may need to approve a short-term funding bill if they are unable to pass year-long spending bills for the next fiscal year.
DeLauro is the longest-serving member of Connecticut’s congressional delegation. She was first elected in 1990.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023_0710_SR_WeickerService_551-scaled.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 10:57:36.988383

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Tuesday, March 18, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s move to establish a state Department of Agriculture during the ongoing legislative special session appears to be turning into a fight over executive power, and it could be ultimately decided by the courts.
Last week, as the special session opened in Juneau, Dunleavy signed an executive order intended to establish the Alaska Department of Agriculture by moving parts of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources into a separate agency.
Alaska is one of only two states without a cabinet-level agriculture department, and Dunleavy has said he wants to create one in order to help the growth of farming in the state. Creating a cabinet-level agriculture department was the top priority of a state “food security” task force in 2022 intended to encourage farming here.
The governor’s order would take effect Jan. 1 and is almost identical to one Dunleavy issued this spring. 
Under the Alaska Constitution, lawmakers can stop an executive order if they vote to dismiss it within 60 days. Legislators did just that with the spring order, voting 32-28 in March to deny the governor’s original order. 
At the time, and since then, legislators have said that they prefer to enact a state department via law because it allows them to include their own ideas and comments of the public.
“The problem with an executive order is that we can’t amend an executive order,” said Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, “and there’s some things that I think folks want to do.”
This month, when Dunleavy repeated the order, legislators refused to accept it. 
Stevens and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said in a letter to the governor that introducing an executive order during a special session is unconstitutional, and that repeating an already disallowed order is also unconstitutional.
“This falls in the category of so many things during Dunleavy’s tenure as governor, where he has tried to push the boundaries with the Legislature. And we’re at the point now where we’re tired of being pushed around,” Edgmon said by phone on Friday.
The governor responded to the legislators’ letter with a letter of his own last week, saying that he has a different legal interpretation and believes the Legislature’s view is wrong.
Jeff Turner, the governor’s communications director, said by email on Friday that the letter still stands as the governor’s view and nothing has changed since then.
“His sort of threat to go ahead anyway is a little disconcerting,” Stevens said. “The legislative process, though long … winds up with a better answer because the public will have a chance to testify in the committee hearings, and we’ll all have a chance to discuss it and try to figure out the best way going forward. Unfortunately, an executive order is really sort of a ham-handed way to organize a new department. I really hope the governor allows us to move ahead and do it on our own through the legislative process.”
Legislators could meet in joint session and again vote down the governor’s executive order, but doing so would be an implicit acknowledgement that the governor has the ability to issue a valid executive order during a special session.
“We’ve heard that from our legal folks,” Stevens said, “that establishing a precedent like that could be dangerous in the future. Any governor then could do something without the Legislature really being involved. … and so we’re really concerned about precedents.”
Those differing positions have created a standoff: Legislators are refusing to accept the order as valid, and the governor’s office has said that if legislators don’t vote it down, Dunleavy will take that as acceptance. He said he will go ahead with plans to create the department on Jan. 1.
If he does that, Stevens said that the issue is likely to go to the courts.
Edgmon said that lawmakers are prepared to stand their ground.
“The Legislature believes its decision to send the executive order back to the governor is based on firm ground, and we fully intend to defend our institution’s ability to do its work,” he said.

This story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on August 9.
CHELSEA — The grieving family of a Newbury, mother of four who was shot and killed by her father more than four years ago pleaded before a Vermont judge never to let her murderer live free in society again and to ensure the state places him in an appropriate institution.
“I’m not here asking for revenge. I’m asking for safety,” said Mason Rheaume, the eldest of Karina Rheaume’s four sons.
He was 18 years old when his mother was killed by a shotgun blast fired by her father, James Perry Jr., on the porch of Perry’s Newbury home in 2021. She had shown up at his door with a plate of cookies for a welfare check.
Karina Rheaume’s family has been reeling ever since the shooting and is now pressing Vermont officials to address the problem of inadequate state resources to handle people whose mental illness has led them to commit horrific crimes.
“Jim Perry must remain in a facility specifically designed for long-term psychiatric care — not a nursing home, not under the limited supervision,” Mason Rheaume said, stating that what his grandfather requires is “ongoing, lifelong oversight in a secure setting that protects him and those around him in the community.”
Mason Rheaume’s statement, along with others from his brother, their father and Karina’s sister were given in a packed courtroom in Chelsea before Superior Court Judge Daniel Richardson, after family friends and supporters contacted the county prosecutor’s office in recent weeks out of concern over Perry’s looming release from prison.
Perry, 74, was found not guilty by reason of insanity earlier this year in the shooting death of his 38-year-old daughter. A psychiatric evaluation concluded he had been “floridly psychotic with paranoid delusions and hallucinations” when he shot Karina at point-blank range with a 12-gauge shotgun on May 3, 2021, at his home on Deerfield Lane in Newbury.

Since the court’s insanity determination, which leaves Perry with no criminal record and with little agency oversight, the Orange County State’s Attorney’s Office and the state Mental Health Department have come under sharp criticism from Karina Rheaume’s family members and supporters who say the state does not do enough to protect victims and the public from the ongoing risk Perry presents to the community as well as himself.
When Emilie Perry, Karina Rheaume’s sister, learned that the options state officials were weighing for her father after his release from prison included his “uninhabitable” home in Newbury, a nursing home or a “hotel in Barre,” she called upon friends and supporters to write to the state attorney’s office to register their concern.
Within days, more than a hundred emails and letters were sent to Colin Seaman, the state attorney for Orange County.
“The court is well aware that this has become an item of great public interest,” Richardson acknowledged from the bench at the outset of the approximately 32-minute hearing, while also cautioning “misinformation” has also accompanied that concern.
Despite its reputation for progressive policies, critics have long contended that Vermont lacks adequate resources and facilities to handle people whose crimes are attributed to mental illness.
The lack of accommodations, for example, led to a Strafford man convicted of arson for burning down his cabin while suffering from delusions in 2023 spending 240 days in a Springfield prison. His attorney maintained his client needed treatment instead.
On Friday, supporters and family members of Karina Rheaume’s family filled every available spot on the visitors’ benches at the back of the second floor courtroom. A large-screen video monitor displayed phone icons of people watching remotely. Karina’s sons, dressed in suits and ties, and Karina’s sister Emilie, sat on the front bench, stifling tears when a family member went to the podium and addressed the judge.
“I urge you to consider the profound impact (Perry’s) actions have had on our family and the community,” Joshua Rheaume, Karina’s second oldest son, said. The unfathomable murder of his mother “point(s) to a deep-seated mental instability that requires long-term, intensive psychiatric care.”

My beautiful, kind big sister, the most loving and dedicated mother I have ever known. Her life matters.” Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley News
Perry, shackled and wearing blue prison sweats, sat at the defense table next to his attorney, Mike Shane. With his hair cropped closely and beard trimmed and hooked up to a hearing aid, Perry appeared alert and compliant, a different visage from the gaunt, wide-eyed, straggly hair and thick, overgrown beard image in his booking photo after his arrest.
Perry’s criminal case ended with the insanity determination, Judge Richardson explained, and he is now in a “civil” phase meant to assess his mental health needs and treatment program. But those issues will be addressed at a future hearing, the judge said.
Family members said there can be no guarantee Perry will not relapse into psychosis.
“While his mental state may appear stable now, (Perry) is in a structured environment of incarceration,” Joshua Rheaume said. “What happens when he is released and faces the stresses and triggers of the outside world? The risk is too great. Our family, community and any potential future victims deserve the assurance of a more permanent solution.
Emilie Perry grasping a tissue and fighting back tears, recounted the disbelief of learning that it was possible her father could be essentially left on his own following the expiration of a 90-day “non-hospitalization order.”
“The shock of this email was so unbelievable that it didn’t seem like it could be real,” Emilie Perry said. “I wrote back saying that was insane and spent the following days calling the state’s attorney, the defense, the mental health department, and anyone I could think of to make sense of what was a horribly terrifying proposal by the courts.”
“To act like the court is working to protect (Perry’s) rights is not true if he’s not given placement in a safe (…) environment. It is cruel to set him up to be unable to take care of himself and put himself and others at risk,” she said.
Both Seaman, the Orange County state’s attorney, and Shane, Perry’s defense attorney, said state officials are working together at multiple agencies and levels to address the public’s concern.
Shane, before Friday’s hearing, said that the Department of Mental Health will extend that order of non-hospitalization “indefinitely” and “if there are issues” then the non-hospitalization order will convert to an “involuntary hospitalization order.”

“There is a really good plan coming together,” Shane said, noting that the Department of Mental Health, the State’s Attorney’s Office, the Judiciary’s Guardian ad Litem Program that advocates on behalf of children who are victims of crime “and our own experts” are “working collaboratively to find the best fit for (Perry’s) needs and the needs of the community. I think when the plan is presented everyone will feel better.”
After Friday’s hearing, on the green outside the courthouse in Chelsea, Joe Rheaume, the father of Karina’s children and her former husband, and Karen Tronsgard-Scott, executive director of the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, both said there are “holes” in the way Vermont handles cases like Perry’s. Once it shifts to a civil matter victims have been excluded from the civil process phase of determining the offender’s fate.
“Victims should really have a seat at the table,” Tronsgard-Scott said. “They should be a part of every process in the courtroom.”
Joe Rheaume said the current system and civil phase needs to change.
“When you have a defendant who’s adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity and the next step is to just release them into society, I mean, everybody can logically think there’s something wrong with that,” Joe Rheaume said.
“There needs to be some kind of ramp or step-down program where this offender gets put into something secure, something semi-secure, anything,” he said.
Friday’s hearing, during which his family got to go on record with their victim impact statements, only happened as the result of the family’s persistence, Joe Rheaume noted.
“We’ve had to advocate for this. We’ve been pushing,” he said.
When it was pointed out that what he seeks requires the Vermont State Legislature to take up the matter and make law where none currently exists, Joe Rheaume acknowledged the challenge.

For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government. The sale and possession of kratom is legal in Pennsylvania.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.

In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two years after police staged a chilling raid on the Marion County Record, the newspaper’s owner-editor remains committed to the hard-hitting journalism that made him a target.
And he wants his ongoing lawsuit against the city and county to hurt.
Eric Meyer appeared on the Kansas Reflector podcast to talk about how things have changed since the Aug. 11, 2023, raid, when police stormed the newsroom under the false pretense that a reporter had committed identity theft by looking up a driving record in a public online database. They took computers and reporters’ personal cellphones, acting outside the scope of a search warrant that was issued in disregard for the U.S. Constitution and state and federal laws that protect journalists.


The raid spawned one state and five federal lawsuits, as well as a criminal charge against Gideon Cody, the former police chief who led the raid. The legal action continues to unfold as attorneys battle in federal court and a hearing in Cody’s case is scheduled for this fall.

Following is an edited and abbreviated Q&A from the podcast with Meyer.
How has your life changed in the past two years?
You don’t have long enough in your podcast to explain it all. It has changed massively. In addition to the practical side of it, that I’ve had a lot of places I’ve gone, a lot of speeches I’ve given, a lot of other things that have gone on, but just the work of it. You know, this was my retirement gig. I was going to come here and do this part-time for fun.
What could be more fun than this?
Well, it is fun. I at one point said that my mother, who died as a result of the stress of the raid, had an opportunity at 98 to go out meaning something in her life. But it’s nice as a retiree to be out here doing something, of still meaning it somehow or another, trying to keep trying — maybe as Don Quixote — to keep journalism alive. But we are trying our hardest to not bow to pressures and still get good journalism out there. And it really is a battle.
What are some of the revelations that have come out since we last checked in with you about this time a year ago?
Not as many as you’d think. We’re still literally blocked from discovery in our federal court lawsuits, which means we can’t go out and interrogate people that we think have information that would be relevant to the case. And part of this is being able to figure out the degree to which political people, elected officials and others, helped push this raid along.
This is important because there’s sort of been a narrative at times to pin this all on one rogue police chief, but I think the evidence clearly shows that one guy can’t do this in isolation. It was a coordinated effort.
Exactly. And I really object when that thought comes up, that this was just Gideon Cody who did this. And yeah, he did a lot of it himself. But there were people within law enforcement who helped him, people in elected positions, people in judicial court positions, who could have and should have stopped him, and they didn’t. Now, was it because they were not courageous? They didn’t want to make waves? Or was it that they agreed with him? Or was it that that they were just incompetent to what’s going on? I don’t know. That would be nice to find out.
Where do things stand in your case?
It’s abundantly clear from the rulings of the judge so far in the case on various motions of dismissal that we’ve probably won the case.
The most telling of these things was we had sued the city of Marion for failing to provide training to its police officers about the Privacy Protection Act, which says that you’re supposed to get subpoenas, not warrants, to raid newsrooms. And the judge threw that out, saying any fool who’d be a cop should know this automatically and without requiring specialized training.
And there are overtures now to try to settle — some official, some unofficial. I’m eager to get the thing done. But there are things other than financial damages at stake here. So there needs to be some admissions. There need to be things that are reported to licensing authorities for police officers other than Gideon Cody.
Are you committed to not settling, to seeing this out through trial?
The real reason we wanted to go to trial was we wanted a ruling on the record that acknowledges that this is something you just don’t do. And if they are willing to provide that as a stipulation, we might accept that. This has never been about money.
This is about making sure that people understand what they did was wrong, admit that publicly. Set it as an example. And somehow or other, it needs to hurt. One of our concerns is that they’ll want to settle up to the limit of their insurance coverage. Well, that really means you did nothing. I mean, it really probably needs to go a little beyond insurance. Now, we don’t want to bankrupt the city or county of Marion by any manner or means. But something that has a little pain to it.
Do you feel like you still have strong community support?
I think everybody, including me, would like to see this over. But they’re very supportive of us. They just don’t like the fact that it looks like we’re hickville. And to be honest, I think that’s a very unfair assumption. I think that Marion and Marion County are not hickville. Some things that went on in Marion and Marion County that probably go on in a lot of other counties have been exposed. We just don’t hear about them in other counties.
And to an extent, Marion County should take pride in the fact there here, we’ve had a situation where somebody tried to trample on rights, and it didn’t happen. We fixed it. We’re in the process of fixing it. So you can take pride in that. It’s not where cops were stupid and raided a newsroom. It’s where somebody tried something stupid and, you know what? They didn’t get away with it. I think that’s a point of pride, but it would be nice to be known for something else.
I think it’s worth pointing out that accountability journalism put you in the crosshairs of police for this raid. But this is the role that journalists need to embrace, right, in this current climate?
Oh, absolutely.
I’m sorry to tell this to a group of people out there: There are facts. And some things are facts. And your opinion of the fact doesn’t change whether it’s a fact or not. And you have to pay attention to the nuances. You have to pay attention to the little things.
You and your late mother were inducted in the Kansas Press Association Hall of Fame last year. I went to the induction ceremony, where you gave this speech, shortly after the election in November, and you gave a sort of rallying cry to journalists. You said: “Make democracy great again.” Are journalists rising to meet this moment?
Some are, when they still have money to do it. I mean, closing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is going to silence a great number of people in public media. Corporations are going to take care of silencing a great number of people elsewhere.
We need to have people aggressively going out and finding out what’s wrong. We had a story this week: They applied a new coating of pavement to the main road that leads to Pilsen, which is the home of Emil Kapaun, the man who’s about to be sainted as a Korean War hero. And it didn’t stick, and the road is now basically untravellable. Did they tell us about it? No! We had to find out about it. And now it’s a game of finger-pointing.
Journalists have joined this Gen Z thing: “We don’t want to embarrass anybody. Oh, my goodness, somebody might take offense if we run this story.” And so they don’t want to do it, and their corporate bosses say, “Oh yeah, they might cancel their ads. Oh, we can’t do that.” So we make our news publications and news broadcasts and other things so dull that nobody wants to read them anymore or listen to them anymore.
I used to say this as a journalism professor — that’s why I came here in my retirement, was that I think there’s still a place in this world for regular, good old-fashioned journalism. And this is from somebody who taught online and stuff like that in school. I said, “We’ve wasted too much time worrying about that stuff, and not enough time worrying about the substance of what we’re reporting. And get out there and get interesting things that matter to people and tell us about them.”
So I said, “Well, I can’t solve it for the world, but maybe I can make a little demonstration project out here that we can try to do it. And of course, somebody says, “Yeah, and what happened to you: You get raided.” Yeah, that’s true. But the raiding gives us more attention.
I may be quixotic in some regards and Pollyannaish in another, but the raid drew attention to the fact that we’re actually trying to do good journalism. So there’s a positive outcome to the raid.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCoRecord-E-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-11 09:56:39.645044

At left is Mitch Meyers, partner at BeLeaf Medical marijuana company (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).Missouri cannabis business owners who have had their license revoked for violating state rules could be prohibited from getting another license under proposed rules announced by state regulators last week. 
The Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation released the draft of a massive overhaul of cannabis rules giving regulators more authority to address a range of issues, including predatory practices in the state’s social-equity cannabis licenses, product recalls involving hemp-derived THC and non-compliant owners obtaining other licenses.
“We have found over the years that there’s really not a lot of structure or authority in rule… for us to address individuals in ownership or potential ownership who have been found to be either violating regulations themselves or responsible for those who are violating rules,” Amy Moore, director of the division, told The Independent Friday. “We have found that that is a gap.”
Among the rule revisions, Moore said, is a requirement for businesses to have mechanisms in place to remove owners who are responsible for violating state regulations. 
Missouri cannabis regulators announce new rules to target ‘predatory’ contracts

The changes cover so much ground, Moore said, because the division hasn’t made any rule alterations since the recreational marijuana constitutional amendment passed in 2022.
“It’s the things that we’ve learned over time,” she said, “and found it needed improvement or needed to be fixed. Hopefully we’re not missing anything.” 
Aside from revisions, a brand new rule released Thursday would establish an unlimited number of research licenses to study cannabis in Missouri.
The public can submit the feedback on the division’s website until Aug. 21, and regulators will then review them and decide if they want to formally submit the rules to the Secretary of State’s Office. 
Moore said if her team decides to move forward, they would like to do it “quickly.”
“If I thought, ‘Okay, we’ve solved everybody’s concern’…we could have it done in a couple weeks,” she said, “but we want to be sure that we are open to all the feedback and that we really consider it all.”
 Delta Extraction case

Nearly a year after the state stripped Robertsville-based Delta Extraction of its license in November 2023, regulators approved one of the company’s co-owners — AJO LLC — to take over a cultivation and manufacturing facility in Waynesville in May 2024. It’s a far bigger operation than Delta Extraction, and it also involves several dispensaries as well.
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the division, told The Independent in May that the rules currently do not prohibit individuals who have had a license revoked from acquiring another license. 
Moore said Friday that the new rules would give the division “a much better standing” to deny an application for a license for an owner who’s been noncompliant previously. 
She hopes it gives licensees “fair warning” when choosing future business partners.
“That’s part of why these new rules are so important,” she said. “This rule gives them a big heads up that that’s not going to work out for them, and they shouldn’t make that investment and get themselves tied up with individuals who have had previous non compliance.”
Co-owners of Missouri company at center of marijuana recall got green light for another license

It also establishes an annual review of ownership for every license. 
In February, Delta lost its appeal to get its license back, with Missouri’s administrative hearing commission concluding it had a “corporate culture of lax compliance with regulatory requirements.”
The scathing 137-page ruling, issued by Commissioner Carole Iles, informed the revisions released Thursday, Moore said. 
Iles agreed with the division that the company’s practice of bringing in hemp-derived THC concentrate from other states and adding it to Missouri-grown marijuana products was a violation of state law. 
“What this is doing is clarifying what we believe has always been in our rules and I think the Delta Extraction order from AHC confirms that that is what our rules mean…” Moore said, “that all the THC and THCA and those types of compounds need to originate from cannabis grown in our licensed facilities.”
 Microbusiness ‘fronts’

The microbusiness program, which was written into the Missouri 2022 constitutional amendment that legalized marijuana, was designed for the licenses to end up in the hands of disadvantaged business owners. The eligibility criteria includes disabled veterans, those with lower incomes and people with non-violent marijuana offenses.
Since the program began in 2023, the division has struggled to prevent what some legal experts have called “fronts,” or arrangements where the profits and ownership weren’t going to people that regulators had certified were eligible. 
Of the 96 microbusiness licenses issued so far, regulators have revoked 34. 
For the last two years, The Independent has documented the pattern of well-connected groups and individuals flooding the microbusiness lottery by recruiting people to submit applications and then offering them contracts that limited their profit and control of the business. A majority of the revoked licenses followed this pattern.
These kinds of agreements violate the constitutional requirement that the license be “majority owned and operated” by eligible individuals, Moore explained at a division town hall meeting in February. 
“It is not sustainable to keep going through rounds of license issuance and then having to do rounds of revocations,” she said in February. “We’re never going to get this market fully built out.”
The division first released rule changes for microbusiness licenses in December. The draft released Thursday includes some of the feedback the division received this winter, Moore said, but retained the core elements.

The designated contact for a microbusiness applicant must still be an eligible individual contributing to the majority ownership of the microbusiness license. And any entity who was the designated contact for a license that was previously revoked for failure to comply with the ownership and operation requirements may not be allowed to be involved in any capacity in a future microbusiness application.  
In order to prevent numerous revocations, the division is proposing to adjust when its extensive application-review period occurs. 
“Those adjustments really clarify what we are actually accomplishing here, which is ensuring that these licenses are held by eligible individuals,” Moore said. “And I think everyone really should agree that that’s the goal. I think the language that they have now is better focused on doing that.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_3084-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 09:56:39.645044

Today marks the first day of a planned three-day trial to determine whether the U.S. military unlawfully carried out civilian law enforcement when it was deployed to Los Angeles under President Donald Trump.
As CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn explains, a California federal district court will take up the matter, which stems from a June lawsuit Gov. Gavin Newsom filed against Trump after the president federalized California’s National Guard in response to demonstrators protesting against immigration raids in L.A. 
Lawyers for the state argue that the military violated a federal law that limits the use of the military in civilian settings. They point out that if the military can accompany immigration enforcement agents in their raids, it sets a precedent that authorizes it to accompany other law enforcement agents while they perform their duties, such as federal food safety inspectors.
The Trump administration says what the military did in L.A. doesn’t count as law enforcement. And because the law limiting military engagement is also a criminal statute, it cannot be invoked by the state since this lawsuit is a civil case.

Speaking of Trump: 

Feds request lift on immigration raids ban: The Trump administration is seeking help from the U.S. Supreme Court by asking it to lift a temporary restraining order, issued by a district court in July, that blocks immigration enforcement agents from conducting raids without “reasonable suspicion” in L.A. and other California counties. In its emergency appeal filed last week, the federal government said that the order is a major barrier to enforcing federal immigration laws. Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos.


Redistricting battle: Newsom on Friday gathered with Democratic lawmakers from Texas in Sacramento to again promote his plan to redraw California’s congressional maps. To counteract Texas Republicans’ plans to redistrict its maps in a way that benefits the GOP in the 2026 midterm elections, Newsom is proposing to call a special election to allow California voters to approve or reject a new map that would strengthen the chances of Democrats flipping Republican-leaning districts. The state Legislature is expected to take up the issue when it reconvenes from summer break on Aug. 18. Read more from CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.

As part of his effort to cut back on immigration and combat alleged antisemitism, Trump issued an executive order in January that resulted in hundreds of international students losing their student status. Though many had their statuses reinstated in April after challenging the order in court, some international students in California are afraid that it will happen again. 
Some told Emewodesh that they have changed their involvement in campus activities, revised the topics they include in their research projects and scrubbed their social media presence.
Campus institutions are also responding to the chilling effect: The editor-in-chief of UC Davis’ student newspaper, for instance, said the outlet is more open to removing articles for the sake of protecting the status of international students.

Instead of addressing homelessness itself, an Assembly bill that would enable cities to tow and destroy RVs would eliminate last-resort shelters for many unhoused Californians, writes Sean Geary, a former unhoused man who led a class-action lawsuit against Pacifica over its banning of parked RVs on city streets.

The Delaware Department of Labor is launching a new initiative aimed at strengthening employment opportunities and protections for the state’s youngest workers.
The “Delaware Youth Workforce Connect Call,” a monthly virtual series organized by the Department’s Division of Industrial Affairs, will debut on Thursday, August 21.
The series is designed to connect community organizations, educators, employers, and state agencies to share resources, provide updates, and support youth employment across Delaware.

The initiative will focus on workers between the ages of 14 and 17, with the goal of educating both employers and young employees about workplace rights, safety, and job readiness.
“Our mission is to ensure Delaware employers understand their responsibilities while safeguarding the rights of workers — especially our youngest members of our workforce,” said Secretary of the Delaware Department of Labor LaKresha Moultrie. “The Delaware Youth Workforce Connect Call creates a space for collaboration, resource sharing, and compliance education that benefits both youth workers and employers.”
The first session will take place via Microsoft Teams from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. and will feature a presentation on child labor laws, legislative updates affecting youth employment, and a preview of upcoming events aimed at preparing young people for the workforce.
In addition to presentations from labor officials, the sessions will offer a platform for participants to exchange tools, best practices, and ideas to promote safe and productive work environments for teens.

Atkins and her spouse, Jennifer LeSar, earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from clients that also lobby state government.","In summary
If elected governor, Toni Atkins faces potential conflicts of interest with her spouse’s consulting firms. Atkins and her spouse, Jennifer LeSar, earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from clients that also lobby state government.


If former state Senate leader Toni Atkins is elected governor next year, she would oversee a state contract that puts money in her own pocket.
Following a directive from Gov. Gavin Newsom to develop state-owned properties for affordable housing, the California Department of General Services in 2020 hired a consulting firm to help prioritize sites, conduct market research and evaluate applications from contractors.
That firm, LeSar Development Consultants, is owned by Atkins’ spouse, Jennifer LeSar. And because of California’s community property law that gives couples equal ownership of assets in their marriage, the $1 million contract — which was reupped in February through 2028 — has been worth tens of thousands of dollars to Atkins, according to financial disclosures.
It’s just one of the potential conflicts of interest with her spouse’s business dealings that Atkins faces as she seeks the most powerful office in California. Nearly half of the major clients last year at LeSar’s companies employed lobbyists to influence government policy.
Disclosure forms filed by Atkins and LeSar list 51 different entities, including the Department of General Services, from which they received more than $10,000 in income last year through LeSar Development Consultants, LeSar Support Services, LeSar Holdings, Inc. or Global Policy Leadership Academy — all firms for which LeSar serves as president or CEO.
A CalMatters analysis found that 24 of those clients are registered lobbyist employers. They include the counties of Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange, the cities of San Jose, Oakland, and Palm Springs, the insurance provider Elevance Health, the Bay Area homelessness advocacy group All Home and the homebuilder Brookfield Residential.
That means Atkins earns hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from entities that could soon be asking for her signature or veto on priority legislation, requesting funding in her state budget proposals or applying for contracts with her administration.
“People who have business before the state could be using the potential governor’s spouse as an advocate, essentially,” said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School and former president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission.
No plan for Atkins on managing conflict
Atkins declined an interview request to discuss how she would handle conflicts of interest as governor. She did not say she would take any specific steps to insulate herself from LeSar’s business dealings or make any changes to their current arrangement.
“Toni is proud of her spouse Jen’s decades of work to expand access to affordable housing in California,” spokesperson Danni Wang said in a statement. “Throughout her leadership in both the Assembly and the Senate, Toni has maintained high ethical standards, prioritizing transparency and avoiding any conflicts of interest. If elected governor, she will continue to uphold those same principles and ensure that every decision is made in the best interest of Californians.”
California’s conflict of interest rules disqualify public officials from participating in governmental decisions that would foreseeably have an impact on their personal finances, though there is an exception if the potential effect does not benefit the official any more than it would the general public. 
Atkins is not the first politician with a family member whose work creates a potential conflict of interest with their elected office. Nor is she the only 2026 gubernatorial candidate whose income could complicate their tenure.
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis told CalMatters in April that she would place her extensive property investments — which include downtown Sacramento office buildings that rent to at least three state agencies and dozens of organizations with business before state government  — in a blind trust if she won next November. She dropped out of the race on Friday.
But the direct financial benefit Atkins receives from LeSar’s income and the expansive portfolio of a governor, encompassing the entirety of California government, make this a particularly thorny case, Levinson said.
Organizations could theoretically hire LeSar to get closer to Atkins, while Atkins, as governor, could direct more state business to LeSar’s companies — though Levinson stressed that the potential for a conflict of interest does not necessarily indicate Atkins has done anything illegal or unethical.
“None of this means that she’s corrupt or she would make corrupt decisions,” Levinson said.
The relationship has long raised eyebrows
Questions about potential conflicts of interest with her spouse’s work have dogged Atkins throughout her rise in California politics. She married LeSar in 2008, when Atkins was a member of the San Diego City Council, and subsequently served 14 years in the Legislature, where she became the first person in more than a century to lead both the Senate and the Assembly.
As a lawmaker, Atkins received some criticism for introducing bills that would have raised taxes and fees to fund affordable housing development, her spouse’s line of work, so she sought permission from an attorney for the Legislature. After she became the Senate president pro tem in 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported that the clientele at LeSar’s firms had nearly quadrupled in five years. Last year, a campaign watchdog alleged that Atkins illegally used campaign funds for a $22,500 study trip to Austria organized by Global Policy Leadership Academy.
Atkins has always denied any wrongdoing.

LeSar’s business portfolio has grown to include four companies, which employ nearly three dozen people. The largest, LeSar Development Consultants, is a management consulting firm that provides strategic advising on affordable housing and homelessness projects. LeSar Support Services manages longer-term housing, public health and disaster recovery programs. Global Policy Leadership Academy offers training courses and study trips focused on urban development. All receive operational support from LeSar Holdings, Inc.
Though not among the most elite tier of affordable housing consultants in the state, LeSar carries considerable influence in the industry, particularly as she has carved out a unique lane with auxiliary services like her training academy, said Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
“There are some obvious synergies and benefits from her involvement in both of those organizations,” said Metcalf, who has attended a Global Policy Leadership Academy study trip.
On a statement of economic interests that LeSar filed last year with San Diego County for her consulting work, she reported the fair market value of LeSar Development Consultants at more than $1 million and for each of her other three companies at between $100,001 and $1 million. State financial disclosures only require filers to provide broad ranges.
Atkins reported receiving more than $100,000 in gross income from each of the four companies last year. That means, under California’s community property law, that LeSar earned at least double that amount — more than $800,000 — across her businesses.
The total income Atkins received is unknown. But nearly 40 of LeSar’s clients paid her enough last year that it triggered disclosure requirements for Atkins as well, because she earned more than $10,000 from each of them. That included the Department of General Services and 18 lobbyist employers.
“There are potential conflicts of interest with respect to any state agency consulting contracts,”  Thomas Hiltachk, a political and election lawyer whose firm helped set up a blind trust for Arnold Schwarzenegger when he became governor in 2003, said in an email. “Such conflicts could also appear with any private consulting clients if such clients have matters or legislation under the Governor’s authority.”
Few solutions for avoiding conflicts
The Department of General Services hired LeSar Development Consultants for its affordable housing project in November 2020, on a three-year contract worth nearly $1.1 million, according to a copy provided to CalMatters. LeSar was paid $301.41 per hour, including labor, fringe benefits, overhead and profit.
Shortly before it expired, the contract was extended for another year for an additional $364,000. Then in February, the department signed a new three-year contract, for just over $1 million, which will keep LeSar Development Consultants advising on proposals to build housing on state-owned properties through 2028. LeSar’s rate has increased to $350 per hour. 
“DGS is using the consultant to help as needed, through project initiation, preparation for and evaluation of proposals submitted by developers, provision of advice for complex policy, technical and procedural matters concerning affordable housing development, and ground lease and financial closings,” Fallon Okwuosa, a department spokesperson, wrote in an email.
CalMatters obtained several other public contracts that LeSar Development Consultants signed with cities and counties listed in Atkins’ statement of economic interest last year. They include a $964,800, one-year contract to produce a housing strategy for San Diego County; a $161,230, one-year contract to update Ventura County’s homelessness strategy; a $120,000, one-year extension of a contract to provide loan underwriting services for San Jose; a $100,000, one-and-a-half-year contract to advise San Jose on financing affordable housing projects, with renewal options through 2030; and a one-year extension of an ongoing $259,600 contract with Monterey County to update its exclusionary housing ordinance.
These local governments all employ lobbyists to weigh in on state budget funding requests and legislation.
Levinson and Hiltachk agreed that there are no easy solutions for Atkins to address the potential conflicts of interest if she is elected governor. Unlike with assets, such as property or investments, Atkins cannot put her spouse’s work in a blind trust.
And it would be complicated, Levinson said, for Atkins to recuse herself from every policy decision that affects LeSar’s clients.
“There’s just too many things that the governor does and too many ripple effects from a governor’s decisions,” Levinson said.
Because even the appearance of conflict of interest could undermine the public’s confidence in Atkins as governor, she added, LeSar might ultimately be forced to narrow the scope of her work or step back from her firms altogether.
“You’re punishing people who might never engage in nefarious behavior,” Levinson said. “But there’s a reason for that.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/051214-Toni-Atkins-2014-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Gary was well known in the electrical community, where his skill, dedication, and kindness left a lasting mark. Outside of work, he was happiest when surrounded by the things he loved most—cars, racing, fishing, and camping. He brought that same joy and energy to his work at Champlain Housing Trust as a maintenance technician. In earlier years, he shared his talents with Ryan Brothers Electrical and Saint Michael’s College, working as an electrician for several years.
Gary was preceded in death by his father, Gary Duffy Sr.; his mother, Penny Madsen (Duffy); and several other beloved family members. He is survived by his loving wife, Julia Duffy (Supernaut), and his son, Kyle Duffy, whom he cherished above all. Also left to honor his memory are his loyal grandpup, Winter; his brother, Dave Duffy, and wife, Alison, along with their children Samantha, Amanda, and William of Shelburne; and his sister, Janis Mitchell (Duffy), and husband, Justin, along with their daughter, Araelynn of Shelburne.
Gary’s heart was especially full when spending time with his great-nephews Trey, Ras, and Ky, and his great-niece, Rayna. He will be remembered for his generous spirit, quick smile, and the way he made everyone feel like family.

Sean Geary
Sean Geary is a former unhoused man who lives in his hometown of Pacifica. In 2021, he led a class-action lawsuit against Pacifica over a local ordinance that banned people in RVs from parking on city streets.


As the cruelty of the second Trump administration continues to come to bear, the recent executive order directing states to states to criminalize unhoused people and institutionalize those with mental health disabilities creates an interesting dilemma for Sacramento politicians.
Over the past few months, legislators have been pushing Assembly Bill 630, legislation that would facilitate the towing, dismantling and essentially the destruction of many RVs statewide under the guise of health and safety. If passed, the state would allow cities to destroy the last lifelines for Californians already pushed out of their homes by skyrocketing rents — and force them into the harsh, punitive systems now championed by the White House. 
Lawmakers should choose compassion and reject AB 630.
This issue is deeply personal for me. In March of 2020, I was working two well-paying jobs in downtown San Francisco yet could only afford to rent an RV. When COVID hit, my medications were cut off. It took nearly three years to have them reinstated. Without medication or steady income for rent, I lost the RV. My dog Rex and I then endured 15 traumatizing months in a shelter, where daily harassment by staff made life unbearable. 
Living there was far worse than being in an RV. After speaking out against the harassment, I was kicked out with one hour’s notice, two hours before sunset, with no chance to collect my belongings. We slept on the ground that night in 40-degree weather. 
After two more months in a tent, with the help of social service providers, I finally secured disability benefits and found an apartment.
Currently, cities and counties can destroy “inoperable” or “abandoned” vehicles valued at $500 or less after towing and storing them for 30 days. This policy already puts many peoples’ homes at risk because many cities declare vehicles inoperable simply if their engine won’t start, or deem them abandoned even when they’re inhabited. AB 630 raises that threshold to $4,000 for RVs, dramatically increasing the number of RVs subject to summary towing, storage and destruction.
As the bill’s author, Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, acknowledges, this will affect most of the tens of thousands of RVs that are used as last-resort shelter. And yet, the bill does nothing to address houselessness itself — all it would do is strip away protections.

 Mark Gonzalez
 Democrat, State Assembly, District 54 (Los Angeles)



Proponents of this bill frame RVs as threats to health and safety, but for many Californians, RVs are their only remaining refuge. Removing these mobile homes directly threatens their personal health and safety. 
Genuine public safety concerns should be addressed without destroying last-resort housing of tens of thousands of Californians. Removing and dismantling someone’s RV takes away their shelter from wind, rain and the dangers of the street, as well as their ability to store water and cook food. It erodes their agency and autonomy. 
Even after these actions, the same number of police officers will be tasked with moving people along — people now more desperate, having lost any semblance of home or privacy.Living one’s private life in public view is highly distressing to begin with. Given the pressures of ticketing and towing from law enforcement, the situation becomes nearly unbearable. For people with homes, basic needs — getting clean, warm, seeking solitude, accessing water, using a restroom, eating a meal, or disposing of garbage — take just moments. For the unsheltered, these tasks can each consume the whole day.
Those that would suffer the negative effects from passage of this bill are our fellow community members struggling the most. There are none more affected by public safety issues than those living them without respite.
It’s far easier to elevate individuals when we don’t begin by knocking them down. California’s leaders should reject this inhumane bill and focus on positive, effective remedies to our housing crisis that leverage peoples’ potential instead.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/073125-San-Francisco-RV-Ban-GV-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Gavin Newsom alleges the Trump administration broke a 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act when it deployed military units to Los Angeles in June.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom alleges the Trump administration broke a 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act when it deployed military units to Los Angeles in June.


Did the U.S. military illegally engage in civilian law enforcement when they were deployed to Los Angeles in June under the orders of President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth?
California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta say yes. Trump’s Department of Justice says no. The three-day trial to answer this question is scheduled to commence today at 10 a.m. in a California federal district court, with implications for the country as Trump continues to signal a desire to deploy troops to patrol domestic city streets.The president has appointed himself chair of a task force on the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, telling reporters that “we’ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military, OK?”
Relatedly, the Department of Defense issued a new activation order to deploy troops in California for another 90 days on Aug. 5, California lawyers told the court in a filing. That came two weeks after the Marines deployed to Los Angeles left and a week after the Trump administration demobilized most of the National Guard.California’s lawyers assert evidence in their briefs, often redacted because of a court order, that the military took part in law enforcement in violation of 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act. They want a judge to order the Trump administration to permanently halt those actions. The Trump Department of Justice counters that those engagements don’t count as law enforcement, but rather fall under the category of supporting immigration law enforcement agents or protecting federal buildings.Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act, a law that would allow the military to engage in law enforcement activity.
How did we get here?
This trial is an extension of the June lawsuit that Newsom filed against Trump after the president took over California’s National Guard. Trump did that in response to protests that broke out in the Los Angeles area after immigration law enforcement agents began workforce raids to apprehend individuals allegedly in the U.S. without proper authorization.Ultimately, about 4,000 troops from the California National Guard and 700 U.S. Marines were deployed to Los Angeles.That month marked a new nadir in the relations between Newsom and Trump. The governor likened the president to failed dictators. Trump endorsed the idea of arresting Newsom.Charles Breyer, the judge in Monday’s case and oversaw the June hearings, initially sided with Newsom, ordering that Trump return the National Guard to the governor. A three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked that move. They found that the Trump administration legitimately called up troops to protect federal buildings and federal employees from some protesters who tossed chunks of concrete and used trash dumpsters as battering rams. California lawyers said the troops’ presence inflamed the protests.The June protests lasted about a week and were largely isolated to a handful of city blocks in the downtown area; Los Angeles is roughly 500 square miles.Breyer then allowed California’s lawyers to depose Trump officials and gather documents to argue California’s case that the Trump administration was violating the law barring the military from acting as a police force. Trump’s Department of Justice lawyers tried to cancel the trial but failed.
What is California’s latest allegation? 
That Los Angeles residents were “subjected to a form of military occupation” as federal troops worked alongside federal immigration agents, “often indistinguishable from each other.”The lawyers say that “never before, in the history of the Nation, has the federal government utilized the military for domestic law enforcement in this manner.”The Trump administration’s “insistence that perimeters, blockades, and other security functions are permissible makes clear they will continue to engage in these activities,” California lawyers with the state attorney general’s office wrote to Breyer.
The lawyers argued that if military forces can accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their raids and arrests, as had been unfolding in Los Angeles, “there would be no logical basis to preclude members of the Armed Forces from accompanying other law enforcement agents when performing their duties,” the California lawyers wrote. Military personnel could accompany federal food safety inspectors, medical fraud investigators or accompany federal voting rights officials to “monitor” election polling places, they wrote.
What are California’s examples of the military acting as police?
Attorneys representing the state pointed to several instances in which they allege troops went too far and violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military in civilian settings:

California attorneys deposed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field director who said National Guard soldiers accompanied immigration officers on as many as 75% of their missions.
Troops accompanied a federal agency during a “law enforcement operation” at a cannabis facility in Riverside County and formed a security perimeter that prevented people from leaving the site. 
Troops allegedly formed security perimeters on July 7 during a demonstration at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles during raids at cannabis farms in Ventura County.
In two incidents, military service members detained civilians, the California lawyers wrote. One took place in Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County, where National Guard troops allegedly “apprehended” a protester. In the other, a Marine on June 13 allegedly detained someone at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles.
California attorneys collected testimony from the deputy chief of staff of the military unit in Los Angeles who said the National Guard is subject to Posse Comitatus and cannot engage in civilian law enforcement. 
The attorneys point to military-issued guidance that “directly providing ‘security functions’ for civilian law enforcement agents is a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,” per their summary. But, the lawyers note, the military unit in L.A. was ordered to “actively provide security during civil law enforcement operations on a near-continuous basis since the deployment began,” the California lawyers wrote. 

How does the federal government respond?
The federal government says California is wrong for four reasons. Some are disputes over technical court procedure and some disputing the facts California’s legal team is presenting.

Federal lawyers wrote that Posse Comitatus is a criminal statute, which cannot be used in a civil case, and the lawsuit is civil, not criminal. 
They dispute that the president or the Department of Defense exceeded its authority in ordering the troops to assist federal immigration law enforcement in apprehensions. “As Supreme Court precedent makes clear, the (Posse Comitatus Act) does not prohibit the President from using troops to protect federal personnel and property,” the Trump administration lawyers wrote.
The federal lawyers also say California has no standing to sue. (California’s attorneys dispute this.)
Fourth, the lawyers say that the National Guard can act as a police force because the law Trump cited to federalize them permits the National Guard to “execute the laws of the United States” if the president is unable to do that with “regular forces,” which at minimum means enforcing “federal immigration laws as well as laws forbidding interference with federal functions or assaults on federal officers and property,” the federal lawyers wrote.

The lawyers also dispute that the military’s role counts as law enforcement. California’s lawyers say the Marines “briefly detained” a protester. But the federal lawyers wrote that action “was in protection of federal property (the individual had attempted to enter a restricted area on federal property multiple times) and the Marines turned that individual over to the LAPD minutes later.”And providing a perimeter for federal immigration law enforcement also doesn’t violate Posse Comitatus, because, as a previous federal court found, “Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to federal troops playing ‘a passive role in civilian enforcement activities,’” the federal lawyers wrote.
What is likely to happen after this trial?
How Breyer will rule is impossible to forecast. He sided with California already only to have a three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals block his orders.Nor is the military the main force acting on the Trump administration’s interpretation of immigration law. The Department of Homeland Security has that role through its various agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.
Those agencies were temporarily blocked by a lower district court judge from making apprehensions in Southern California based on race, ethnicity, language, and location or employment. The move sought to block “roving” immigration stops in California’s most populous region. 
A panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that block. Last week the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States to lift the lower court’s restraining order.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-Natl-Guard-MDC-DTLA-TS-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM will offer AI-related tools to California’s schools and universities in an effort to prepare the state’s students for a changing economy.


As artificial intelligence replaces entry-level jobs, California’s universities and community colleges are offering a glimmer of hope for students: free AI training that will teach them to master the new technology. 
“You’re seeing in certain coding spaces significant declines in hiring for obvious reasons,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday during a press conference from the seventh floor of Google’s San Francisco office. 
Flanked by leadership from California’s higher education systems, he called attention to the recent layoffs at Microsoft, at Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and at Salesforce Tower, just a few blocks away, home to the tech company that is still the city’s largest private employer.
Now, some of those companies — including Google and Microsoft — will offer a suite of AI resources for free to California schools and universities. In return, the companies could gain access to millions of new users.
The state’s community colleges and its California State University campuses are “the backbone of our workforce and economic development,” Newsom said, just before education leaders and tech executives signed agreements on AI.
The new deals are the latest developments in a frenzy that began in November 2022, when OpenAI publicly released the free artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, forcing schools to adapt.
The Los Angeles Unified School District implemented an AI chatbot last year, only to cancel it three months later without disclosing why. San Diego Unified teachers started using AI software that suggested what grades to give students, CalMatters reported. Some of the district’s board members were unaware that the district had purchased the software. 
Last month, the company that oversees Canvas, a learning management system popular in California schools and universities, said it would add “interactive conversations in a ChatGPT-like environment” into its software. 
To combat potential AI-related cheating, many K-12 and college districts are using a new feature from the software company Turnitin to detect plagiarism, but a CalMatters investigation found that the software accused students who did real work instead.
Mixed signals?
These deals are sending mixed signals, said Stephanie Goldman, the president of the Faculty Association of California Community Colleges. “Districts were already spending lots of money on AI detection software. What do you do when it’s built into the software they’re using?”
Don Daves-Rougeaux, a senior adviser for the community college system, acknowledged the potential contradiction but said it’s part of a broader effort to keep up with the rapid pace of changes in AI. He said the community college system will frequently reevaluate the use of Turnitin along with all other AI tools. 
California’s community college system is responsible for the bulk of job training in the state, though it receives the least funding from the state per student. 
“Oftentimes when we are having these conversations, we are looked at as a smaller system,” said Daves-Rougeaux. The state’s 116 community colleges collectively educate roughly 2.1 million students.
In the deals announced Thursday, the community college system will partner with Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM to roll out additional AI training for teachers. Daves-Rougeaux said the system has also signed deals that will allow students to use exclusive versions of Google’s counterpart to ChatGPT, Gemini, and Google’s AI research tool, Notebook LLM. Daves-Rougeaux said these tools will save community colleges “hundreds of millions of dollars,” though he could not provide an exact figure. 
“It’s a tough situation for faculty,” said Goldman. “AI is super important but it has come up time and time again: How do you use AI in the classroom while still ensuring that students, who are still developing critical thinking skills, aren’t just using it as a crutch?”
One concern is that faculty could lose control over how AI is used in their classrooms, she added.
The K-12 system and Cal State University system are forming their own tech deals. Amy Bentley-Smith, a spokesperson for the Cal State system, said it is working on its own AI programs with Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM as well as Amazon Web Services, Intel, LinkedIn, Open AI and others. 
Angela Musallam, a spokesperson for the state government operations agency, said California high schools are part of the deal with Adobe, which aims to promote “AI literacy,” the idea that students and teachers should have basic skills to detect and use artificial intelligence.
Much like the community college system, which is governed by local districts, Musallam said individual K-12 districts would need to approve any deal. 
Will deals make a difference to students, teachers?
Experts say it’s too early to tell how effective AI training will actually be.  
Justin Reich, an associate professor at MIT, said a similar frenzy took place 20 years ago when teachers tried to teach computer literacy. “We do not know what AI literacy is, how to use it, and how to teach with it. And we probably won’t for many years,” Reich said. 
The state’s new deals with Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM allow these tech companies to recruit new users — a benefit for the companies — but the actual lessons aren’t time-tested, he said. 
“Tech companies say: ‘These tools can save teachers time,’ but the track record is really bad,” said Reich. “You cannot ask schools to do more right now. They are maxed out.”
Erin Mote, the CEO of an education nonprofit called InnovateEDU, said she agrees that state and education leaders need to ask critical questions about the efficacy of the tools that tech companies offer but that schools still have an imperative to act. 
“There are a lot of rungs on the career ladder that are disappearing,” she said. “The biggest mistake we could make as educators is to wait and pause.”
Last year, the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office signed an agreement with NVIDIA, a technology infrastructure company, to offer AI training similar to the kinds of lessons that Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM will deliver. 
Melissa Villarin, a spokesperson for the chancellor’s office, said the state won’t share data about how the NVIDIA program is going because the cohort of teachers involved is still too small.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Community-College-Budget-LJ-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

(Photo by Airman Hannah Bean/U.S. Air Force)In the gilded sanctuaries of America’s churches, a new kind of sermon is being preached—not one of salvation, but one of electioneering. Thanks to the IRS’s quietly seismic reinterpretation of the Johnson Amendment, pastors may now endorse candidates from the pulpit without fear of losing their tax-exempt status. The cross has been joined by the campaign banner.
This evolution — or erosion — is not merely a bureaucratic quirk. It is a radical shift in nonprofit oversight, one that invites political operatives to launder influence through houses of worship, cloaked in immunity and shielded by the First Amendment.
When a pastor delivers an endorsement mid-sermon, the offering plate becomes a conduit for tax-deductible campaign contributions. In that moment, the line between theological truth and political talking point vanishes.
Pastors are finally free to speak — will they have the courage?

And yet, where is the accountability?
The IRS has, in essence, created a special class of nonprofit untouchables. Secular charities face strict scrutiny if they dabble in electoral politics — but churches can now participate freely under the veil of religious expression. This is not equal enforcement. It is institutional favoritism.
More troubling is the collapse of transparency. Religious organizations are not required to disclose their donors. When these entities engage in political speech, we lose sight of where money is flowing and whose interests are being served. Dark money doesn’t have to hide anymore — it can simply congregate.
Democracy suffers when campaign finance laws stop at the sanctuary doors. Free speech is a pillar of our republic, yes — but tax benefits are not a birthright. They are a social contract, granted in exchange for civic responsibility and nonpartisan service. When that contract is broken, the public foots the bill for partisan pulpits.
It’s time to rewrite the rules.
Congress must act decisively. The Truth in Political Advertising Act should define nonprofit political speech clearly, enforce donor transparency across the board, and end the double standards that threaten civic trust. Let churches preach freely — but not at the expense of the voter’s right to know.
If sermons have become stump speeches, then the tax-exempt status should come with campaign finance strings. We fund pulpits for prophecy, not propaganda. And we deserve a democracy whose soul isn’t sold behind closed chapel doors.

Many have been told that if you dare to teach your congregations how biblical principles apply to elections, if they ever endorsed a candidate or spoke too directly about public policy, they would jeopardize their church’s tax-exempt status.
This chilling effect traces back to the Johnson Amendment of 1954, a politically motivated punitive measure meant to silence the famed senator’s political opponents, long been used to muzzle churches on matters of politics and policy.
Last month, that muzzle finally dropped. In a groundbreaking move, the IRS clarified that pastors and religious leaders are not bound by the Johnson Amendment when speaking to their own congregations. They can preach the full counsel of God, including guidance on civic engagement, candidates, and legislation. They no longer have to fear losing their tax-excempt status.
Crosses, campaigns and cloakrooms: How tax-free pulpits became political podiums

This is a monumental announcement that extends a precious gift to every Marylander of faith, no matter their religion or politics.
Yet as much as I celebrate this decision, I’m also sobered by a hard truth: laws and court decisions can change overnight, but courage is harder to summon.
For years, pastors convinced themselves that staying silent on politics was simply prudent. They reasoned, “If I avoid endorsing candidates or wading into legislation, more people hear the Gospel and I preserve the peace.”
But that caution is rooted more in misunderstanding and complacency, rather than in truth. Worse, it is bolstered by a deeper myth that has done untold damage to our country: The false idea of a rigid “separation of church and state,” which supposedly prohibits the church from influencing civic life.
The Constitution says nothing about separation of church and state. Nor is it what Scripture teaches. In fact, the Bible offers no divide between sacred and secular. To paraphrase Abraham Kuyper’s famous line, there is not a single square inch of this world over which Christ does not declare, “Mine!”

Because many pastors have lacked the courage to speak boldly into the public square, generations of believers have not been discipled to think biblically about politics. The result? Churches that shy away from teaching on critical cultural questions, and Christians who cast votes without considering or understanding how timeless truths should shape their civic choices.
This is why the IRS ruling is both liberating and convicting. It removes every last excuse for timid pulpits. Pastors can now freely endorse candidates and equip their flocks to advocate for legislation that aligns with biblical principles, using every modern means at their disposal.
In this digital age, that doesn’t just mean Sunday sermons. It includes livestreams, email newsletters, Facebook videos, podcasts, and every other platform where churches already connect with their congregations.
Still, I fear that some pastors will cling to silence. The IRS may have taken off the shackles, but not every pastor will find the will to walk free. They will continue to avoid “controversial” topics, not out of legal necessity, but because they lack the fortitude to risk pushback.
That’s a tragedy. Because when pastors shrink back, they rob their congregations — not of political opinions, but of the full counsel of God. They leave believers spiritually underfed, unequipped to bring biblical wisdom into the voting booth, the school board meeting or the halls of Annapolis.
It doesn’t have to be this way. It is time to change the norm. I am hopeful that courageous pastors, who understand there is no aspect of life untouched by God’s authority, will lead by example. That their boldness will inspire others to step forward and teach their people how to live out their faith fully, including in public life.
At the Maryland Family Institute, we stand ready to come alongside churches, parishes and congregations in this mission. We want to see Maryland’s pulpits ablaze with truth, unafraid to speak on biblical issues that shape our families, our communities, and our laws. We want to see believers equipped not only to worship on Sunday but to live and witness wisely on Tuesday at the polls.
So yes, the IRS ruling is cause for celebration. It is a victory for free speech, for religious liberty, and ultimately for the health of our democracy. But it is also a test for pastors.

Gaines/Maryland Matters)The annual Maryland Association of Counties summer conference has evolved into several things over the years.
It’s a forum for wonky discussions about near- and long-term policy and budgetary challenges. An opportunity for local bureaucrats to network and refresh their professional skills and credentials. A venue for vendors to peddle their services to government procurement officers. A chance for the governor to report to his fellow policymakers.
And it’s become party central, with a dizzying array of round-the-clock fundraisers, receptions and other social gatherings at bars and restaurants throughout Ocean City.
But at its most basic level, MACo is the biggest gathering of Maryland’s political clan of the year. So with the critical 2026 elections just around the corner, the political landscape is sure to be Topic A as Maryland leaders descend on the state’s top resort town for sand, surf, strategizing and soothsaying.
At first glance, 2026 in Maryland appears to be a sleepier and less consequential cycle than the historic election of 2022, when there were vacancies for all four statewide offices – governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller and attorney general – and voters chose trailblazers for each position.
All four – Gov. Wes Moore (D) and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), along with Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) and Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) – are early favorites for reelection. Some may have no serious opposition at all.
But with the national political dynamic so tumultuous – and with Maryland disproportionately impacted by the chaos and uncertainty in the federal government – state and local races will be affected in myriad, incalculable ways. Moore’s prominence as a probable presidential contender in 2028 will add to the weight and scrutiny of the 2026 outcome here.
“I think unpredictable is the word,” said Jessica Haire, a Republican former county councilmember from Anne Arundel County, who is chair of Opportunity Maryland, an advocacy group promoting economic growth and free market policies.
Maryland’s elections coincide with a period of instability and voter anger rarely seen in modern politics. National polls show voters deeply unhappy with both major political parties. And that could produce some surprising results in Maryland and beyond.
“The word that keeps coming back to me is disquiet – there’s disquiet in the electorate,” said Len Foxwell, a Democratic consultant.
Ordinarily, in the first midterm election of a president’s term, the “out” party makes significant gains – and there are certainly ingredients in place that could make it a good cycle for Democrats in 2026.
But assumptions about the midterms, and their consequences for 2028, become tricky in the volatile age of President Donald Trump, who has remade government, political discourse and media coverage in remarkable ways. Democrats, who are simultaneously looking to shake off their demoralizing defeat to Trump and are grappling with ideological, generational and tactical battles throughout the country, may be taking their 2026 prospects for granted.
“I think, both locally and nationally, we assume everybody’s going to be where they are, from the governor to all elected officials,” said former Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker (D). “But we don’t really know how they’re going to wind up.”
At the dawn of this year’s MACo conference, it’s easy to see that county elections will be among the most hard-fought and significant of the 2026 cycle.
Four of the state’s biggest counties will be electing new executives next year, and “each race will be brutal,” a leading state Democratic operative predicts. Several downballot elections in the counties – including internecine battles for state’s attorney, sheriff, county council seats and other offices – will be equally tempestuous.
“The greatest opportunity for political dynamism next year rests not with state elections or the General Assembly but with our county governments,” Foxwell said.
Known unknowns
Maryland’s 2026 primaries are on June 30. The candidate filing deadline is on Feb. 24.
Some key questions about 2026 races remain unanswered:
– Will former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) try to get his old job back, setting up an epic battle with Moore? Hogan has been strafing Moore on social media, but has taken no overt steps to organize a campaign; strategists on both sides of the aisle believe he is almost certainly the GOP’s best hope next year.
“I think the governor will win,” Baker said of Moore. “I think he could win big. But he will definitely have vigorous opposition.”
– Will U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives in Maryland history, seek another term next year, when he will be 87 years old? Not even his closest friends seem to know – and several downballot races could be impacted if he chooses to call it a career, as ambitious pols scramble to succeed him.
Baker said Hoyer’s plans may hinge on whether he thinks Democrats can retake the majority in the U.S. House.
– Even more basically, will Maryland lawmakers seek to redraw the state’s congressional lines next year, as state House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) has suggested, in retaliation for mid-decade redistricting efforts underway in Texas and other Republican-dominated legislatures?
“Does Maryland respond to Texas?” asked Mileah Kromer, a pollster and director of the University of Maryland Baltimore County Institute for Politics. “That decision could have serious political ramifications.”
Moon plans to introduce legislation that would require Maryland lawmakers to consider a mid-decade remap of congressional boundaries if another state changes its map. But even Moon, in an interview, said it wasn’t clear if the bill would mandate action or produce new district lines before the 2026 election, or if Democratic leaders will choose that path.
“At a certain point, a lot of these decisions go above my pay grade,” he said.
Through a spokesperson, Moore told The Baltimore Sun last week that he would consider “all options” on redistricting.
Democrats already hold a 7-1 advantage in the state’s House delegation, so making U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) vulnerable would require even more gerrymandering. He won reelection by 22 points last year, and Jake Day (D), Moore’s charismatic state secretary of Housing and Community Development, is pondering a challenge.
But the task of weakening Harris’ political position may not be impossible: Only the 6th congressional district, occupied by freshman Rep. April McClain Delaney (D), is remotely competitive. She won her seat last fall by a little over 5 points; the state’s other six Democrats won theirs by an average of 45 points, with victory margins ranging from 18 points (Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr.) to 77 points (Rep. Glenn Ivey). Some of these members would have to sacrifice safe Democratic territory to put Harris’ seat in play.
And it’s worth pointing out that a court in 2022 rejected Maryland Democrats’ attempts to put Harris’ district in play as unconstitutional.
Democratic gerrymandering has also limited the number of competitive seats in the General Assembly. Can Republicans target more than a handful of Democratic-controlled seats next year? Do Democrats have any pick-up opportunities in GOP districts?
If there are any vulnerable state legislators in 2026, they may face more peril in their party primaries than in the general election. Democratic supermajorities in the state Senate and House of Delegates do not appear to be in any danger at this point.
A bigger and more basic question is whether the two parties in Maryland are even equipped to challenge for seats where the other side has long dominated.
Republicans have won three of the last six gubernatorial elections, but the state GOP is in thrall to Trump, who has appeal in conservative pockets of Maryland but limits the party’s ability to compete statewide and in bigger jurisdictions. Republicans are unlikely to run a strong candidate for Howard County executive next year, even though the GOP held the job as recently as 2018; the same may be true in Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County, depending on Haire’s plans. Bigger Republican benches in conservative jurisdictions have yet to yield candidates who can compete at the statewide level or for many congressional seats.
Conservative Democratic elected officials have all but vanished in Maryland; they controlled the General Assembly just a generation ago. Democrats have seemingly impenetrable advantages in several large suburban counties that were swing areas just a few elections ago. But as Maryland Democrats become more liberal and more in sync with the national party, their ability to make gains in conservative parts of the state diminishes.
Partisan arguments and counter-arguments
Even with the conflicting political signals, smart minds in both parties in Maryland see reason for optimism this election cycle.
Moon, the House majority leader, said Trump’s assault on the federal government and programs resonate in every corner of Maryland, benefiting Democrats.
“It’s a midterm where the GOP has set out to destroy our state,” he said. “We’ve got a cannon aimed directly at our head – we’ve got to do our best to dodge it.”
Sophia Silbergeld, a Baltimore-based Democratic fundraiser and strategist, said state Democrats will prosper if they portray themselves as a bulwark against Trump policies.
“As long as Democrats message strategically and paint themselves as an alternative to Trump, they will do well in Maryland in 2026,” she said. “State and local officials can message that they’re the last bastion against the Trump administration.”
But Jim Burton, a former executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, said tax and fee increases pushed through by Moore and legislative Democrats over the past two years could come back to haunt them electorally; he sees some of the same elements at play this cycle that propelled former Republican Govs. Larry Hogan and Bob Ehrlich to victory and almost elected Ellen Sauerbrey governor in 1994.
“We don’t know what the environment will look like in a year and a few months from now, but there are a lot of things on the table that could be a problem for Democrats,” said Burton, a pollster who advises GOP clients in Maryland and other states. “We could be looking at a period of history repeating itself. I like the situation that we’re in right now.”
Kromer acknowledged that voters will be driven by economic issues, but noted that the impact of the Trump administration’s policies on the state will also be top-of-mind to Democratic voters, making it difficult for Republican candidates to piece together a broad coalition, as Hogan did so deftly in 2014 and 2018.
“Like all voters, Democrats are driven by taxes and cost-of-living issues, but they’re particularly angry about Trump being back in the White House, and that anger will create a serious obstacle for Moore’s eventual challenger,” she said. “Just look at what happened in 2022.”
Foxwell said rising utility costs are a source of great outrage for voters and present a major challenge for Maryland political leaders in both parties.
“The one issue that keeps blinking as a big issue for me is the cost of energy, and it poses risks for Democrats and Republicans,” he said. “The proclivity of Annapolis lawmakers for blaming [grid operator] PJM is a losing strategy. People don’t know what PJM is, and they know they didn’t vote for PJM.”
Known knowns
One thing that is certain about the 2026 election in Maryland is that the open-seat races for county executive in Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Howard and Montgomery counties will be among the most intense of the cycle – especially in the Democratic primaries.
“The theater of combat in the counties this cycle is not going to be Republicans vs. Democrats, but establishment Democrats vs. insurgents,” Foxwell predicted.
Anne Arundel, considered a purple jurisdiction, is a paradox: Democrats have made significant and potentially durable gains in the last few elections, even as angry divides have erupted among party leaders and activists – especially since the death in 2019 of the late House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D), who had a robust political organization and was a unifying figure for county Democrats.
The Democratic race to replace term-limited County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) features County Councilmembers Alison Pickard and Pete Smith, and James Kitchin, a top aide to Pittman who has his boss’ support. Skirmishing among the candidates and their supporters seems inevitable. Even so, the Democrats are likely to hold the seat if Haire does not run – and might be favored, given the national dynamics of the political cycle, even if she does.
Haire, who lost to Pittman by 7 points in 2022, said she is still pondering her political options for 2026 but doesn’t think Anne Arundel voters will be swayed by the national political dynamic.
“We have an electorate that really pays attention, and local issues really matter to folks,” she said.
Baltimore County features a four-way Democratic primary to replace County Executive Kathy Klausmeier (D), who was appointed to complete the final two years of Olszewski’s tenure and isn’t expected to seek a full term of her own. The wide-open race features Councilmembers Julian Jones, Izzy Patoka and Pat Young, along with Nick Stewart, a businessman, attorney and former county school board member.
Republicans have yet to put up a candidate for the race, but intriguingly, former state Sen. Jim Brochin, a moderate who lost the 2018 Democratic primary to Olszewski by just 17 votes, has floated the possibility of running in the general election as an independent. He could be formidable, if he gets sufficient funding.
In Howard County, Del. Jessica Feldmark (D), who served as chief of staff to former County Executive Ken Ulman (D), is likely to rack up a substantial amount of establishment support as she looks to replace the outgoing executive, Calvin Ball (D). Councilmembers Deb Jung and Liz Walsh are also seeking the Democratic nomination, and the field could grow.
No Republican has come forward yet in Howard, and it’s hard to see a strong contender emerging. Allan Kittleman was the GOP nominee in the last three elections – winning once and losing twice.
In Montgomery County, County Executive Marc Elrich (D) is term limited, and three young Democratic council members are the leading candidates, so far, to replace him: Andrew Friedson (39), Evan Glass (48) and Will Jawando (42). The last Republican county executive was elected in 1974.
At least three of the open-seat candidates for county executive in the state – Feldmark, Pickard and Smith – have scheduled fundraisers in Ocean City this week to coincide with MACo. So has Frederick County Executive Jessica Fitzwater (D), who is seeking a second term.
As usual, Ocean City will be the center of the political universe for a few days this week. By the time next summer’s MACo conference takes place, the 2026 primaries will have come and gone – and the world could look a lot different.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/maco-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
Underwater grasses continued to mount a comeback in the lower Chesapeake Bay last year, while a steady recovery also continued in upper portions of the Bay.
Areas in between were a different story, as declines in the mid-section of the Chesapeake more than offset improvements elsewhere.
Overall, data from the 2024 aerial survey showed a mixed bag of results, with the Baywide acreage of underwater meadows — one of the Chesapeake’s most critical habitats — decreasing by about 1% but with diverse trends in different areas.
“This year really shows just how dynamic the system is, that we can have two very different trends emerge in different areas,” said Chris Patrick, a researcher with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who oversees the annual aerial survey of grass beds.
Indeed, last year saw more underwater grasses in the high salinity waters of the lower Bay than had been observed since the survey began four decades ago. The Susquehanna Flats in the upper Bay also saw significant expansion. But the mid-Bay saw large losses, especially along the Eastern Shore.
Altogether, the 2024 survey found 82,778 acres of submerged aquatic vegetation, or SAV, down from 83,419 acres in 2023.
That is well below the Chesapeake Bay Program goal of 185,000 acres, though it is significantly more than the 38,227 acres observed in 1984 when the survey began.
Underwater grass beds provide an important refuge for juvenile blue crabs and fish, as well as food for water­fowl. Plus, they pump oxygen into the water, their roots help stabilize sedi­ment and their leaves buffer wave action.
They are also a closely watched indicator of Bay health because the plants require clear water to get the sunlight needed to survive. They die off when sediment and nutrient-fueled algae blooms cloud the water.
But grass beds are not the same throughout the Chesapeake. Beds in different areas consist of different species based on the salinities of the water, and they can be impacted by local factors as opposed to Baywide conditions.
That might have been at play last year in the mid-Bay where higher than normal spring river flows shifted sharply to lower than normal summer flows. That might have contributed to Eastern Shore losses, said Brooke Landry, a biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and chair of the state-federal Bay Program’s SAV Workgroup.
“It shows that we’re still susceptible to climate change, with super hot water and highly variable river flows potentially impacting the grasses as well as overall water quality,” she said.
Here’s how the Bay fared in different regions last year.
High salinity zone
The best news was in the high salinity, or polyhaline, portion of the Bay, which stretches south from the Rappahannock River and Tangier Island to the mouth of the Bay. The survey found 24,800 acres of grass in that area, a 14% increase from 2023 and the most recorded since the survey began.
It’s especially good news because the area is dominated by eelgrass, a species that is especially sensitive to warming temperatures and poor water quality and has suffered repeated setbacks over the years. As Bay temperatures have increased, polyhaline SAV coverage declined to just 11,975 acres in 2019.
Patrick said the comeback was driven in part by better water clarity, which means the plants get more light and allows eelgrass to move into deeper waters — sometimes as deep as 9 feet.
Last year saw notable increases in Mobjack Bay, Poquoson Flats and nearby Western Shore areas.
“We’ve seen a lot of big expansions,” Patrick said, including areas where grasses had not previously been observed. “It certainly looks like this is tied to improving water clarity. I mean, anecdotally, the water looks clear to me out there.”
The Bay Program goal for the polyhaline is 33,647 acres.
Tidal fresh zone
The tidal fresh zone of the upper Bay and upper portions of its tidal tributaries had 20,218 acres, a 2% increase from last year.
The large grass bed in the Susquehanna Flats, located near the mouth of the Bay’s largest tributary, increased to 10,925 acres last year. That was a 2% increase from 2023 and accounted for slightly more than half of all SAV in tidal fresh waters.
The tidal fresh zone, which hosts more than a dozen SAV species, also saw notable increases in Maryland’s Northeast River on the upper Eastern Shore and in Piscataway Creek off the Potomac River.
Not all the news was good. In Virginia, the upper Mattaponi River and upper portions of the tidal James River saw losses.
The Bay Program goal for the tidal fresh zone is 20,602 acres.
Low salinity zone
The slightly salty oligohaline zone, a relatively small area which includes portions of the up­per Bay and tidal tributaries, saw a 46% increase, to 4,730 acres.
Much of that was a bounce back from losses in recent years, particularly in and near Maryland’s Gunpowder and Middle rivers, which had seen recent declines. Other areas with increases included the Elk, Sassafras, Bush, and Back rivers in Maryland; the middle Potomac; and the middle Rappahannock in Virginia.
But the Chickahominy River in Virginia suffered a significant decline.
The oligohaline zone has the least amount of potential underwater grass habitat, with a Bay Program goal of 10,334 acres.
Mid-salinity zone
The mesohaline zone, with mid-range salinity, suffered a 14% decline, dropping to 33,031 acres. It has the largest amount of potential SAV habitat — its restoration goal is 120,306 acres — and it stretches southward from near Baltimore to the Rappahannock River and Tangier Island in Virginia. It includes large sections of most tidal rivers.
It is dominated by widgeon grass, which is notorious for rapid changes linked to water quality.
Most of the larger losses were along the Eastern Shore. In the lower Choptank River grass coverage fell by 2,200 acres, which made scientists think local conditions were at play.
Patrick said it is likely that heavy spring rains washed more nutrients off the land, which led to reduced water clarity in the Choptank and some other rivers in the area.
Landry said rapid salinity changes, spurred by high flow events in the spring and near-drought conditions in the summer, may have contributed to losses. “While widgeon grass does have a really broad salinity tolerance, it doesn’t respond well to rapid changes in salinity particularly when stressed by water quality,” she said.
While the area saw overall losses, some locations had notable increases, including the Patapsco River in Maryland and the Piankatank River in Virginia.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/689217d45061b.1-1024x668.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.

Read the series >


A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The U.S. Election Assistance Commission — an independent, bipartisan commission charged with ensuring secure, accurate and accessible elections — is launching a national effort to recruit poll workers, including in Utah. 
“Utah needs you,” Commissioner Donald Palmer said in an interview with Utah News Dispatch on Friday. 
Tuesday — which is also Utah’s municipal primary — is National Poll Worker Recruitment Day, when the U.S. Election Assistance Commission kicks off a nationwide effort to encourage more people to volunteer at their local county clerks office and sign up to be election workers ahead of the November general election. 
“Where there’s a primary, there’s always going to be a general (election),” Palmer quipped, saying the aim of scheduling National Poll Worker Recruitment Day on the same day of municipal primaries is to recruit more poll workers ahead of the 2025 November election, when voters typically turn out in higher numbers. 
‘Go see for yourself’: These poll workers want to demystify the voting process for you

By raising awareness on a day when Utahns are thinking about their local elections, Palmer said he hopes more Utahns will consider being a part of the process this fall. 
Across the nation, clerks are seeing a “dramatic decrease in the number of poll workers available,” Palmer said, noting that for the 2024 presidential election, 772,000 Americans served as poll workers, according to the 2024 Election Administration and Voting Survey Report. That’s down from what’s typically been 1 million. 
While it’s been getting incrementally easier to recruit election volunteers since 2020, recruitment efforts have trended easier since 2020, still about 48% of clerks’ elections jurisdictions across the nation reported it’s either “very difficult” or “somewhat difficult” to find poll workers, according to that survey. Of that 48%, 14.3% said it’s “very difficult” while 33.6% said it’s “somewhat difficult.” 
While Utah is not facing a dire poll worker shortage, Palmer said he’s still encouraging Utahns to volunteer, noting that what he hears most from Utah clerks is a need to help process by-mail ballots since the vast majority of Utah voters use the state’s vote-by-mail system. 
He also said some counties are in more need than others — noting that rural areas with smaller populations often face more challenges recruiting poll workers. 
In Utah during the 2024 November election, 104,350 people cast ballots in person on Election Day and 36,381 people voted early in person, while about 1.3 million by-mail ballots were cast and counted, according to the national survey. 
By comparison, Utah only reported 1,110 total poll workers for that election. 
That survey also showed that in 2025, about 40% of Utah’s poll workers were new recruits. 
Palmer said that shows there’s been “a lot of turnover” and “a need for poll workers” in Utah — demonstrating that people are not volunteering anymore, likely because they’re getting older or are no longer able to. 
“We have an aging population of poll workers,” Palmer said. 
He noted that the survey found the vast majority of poll workers in 2024 were over the age of 40, with nearly 60% ages 61 and older. That includes 31.1% that were between the ages of 61 and 70, and 28.1% that were 71 and older. 
Republicans are losing trust in elections, even in Utah. What should be done?

“It really does (show) we need to start recruiting younger and middle-aged Americans to really fill the gap. Because at some point, they’re going to retire,” he said.
Palmer urged younger Utahns — who may not even be aware of the opportunity to serve their communities in this way — to consider being an election worker.
“I really encourage people to try (volunteering) at least one or two elections, because it will give you great insight, and the people that continue on year after year, some of these folks, they absolutely love it. They’re going to do it for the rest of their lives,” he said. “So we really do want young people and other Americans to see the voting process.”
He also said more people being involved in local election processes can help combat rising distrust in election security. 
“It’s right on the ground. You can see how the voting process works,” he said. “You really do, as a poll worker, get to see the checks and balances within a polling place. You get to see the efforts that go into chain of custody and how we make sure the ballots equate to the number of people that have voted. And the care that’s taken with those ballots. … It really is the best place to understand how the voting process works.”
“There really does need to be replacement poll workers as we move to the future,” he said.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)This is the third of a three-part series on Alabama school districts under state intervention. Part 1 on Bessemer City Schools is here. Part 2 on Dallas County Schools is here.  
On a recent June day, Sumter County Schools students  went to the front office to get permission slips signed on one of the last days of summer school. 
While parents work, the kids are able to get a head start in their new grade through the summer bridge program. As Sumter County Schools Superintendent Marcy Burroughs was walking down the hall, a student called after her asking for summer learning to be extended.
“I’m bored inside the house,” he said.
Burroughs teased the student.
“So you want to do year-round school?” She asked him. He shook his head, seemingly wishing he never said a word.
Burroughs continued on, explaining the upgrades made to the school, like a new camera system and new HVACs throughout the school. 
Sumter is consolidating all its schools on the campus of Sumter Central High School. The high school itself lies in the shadow of a new elementary school wing. 
When the Alabama State Department of Education took over Sumter County Schools in August 2023, the district had 923 students between its four schools, a drop of more than 100 from the year prior.
Intervention takes many different forms around the state; in Sumter, it will end in school closures and new construction. State Superintendent Eric Mackey plans to close three schools and move them to the York Central High School campus, into a new facility for elementary students.
The $14 million construction is set to be completed by December, Burroughs said. 
“We’re hoping to be in by January, but with the weather and the rain,” Burroughs said. “We will definitely be in by next August.”
The school closures, Mackey said in a phone interview Thursday, were necessary due to the condition of the facilities and low membership.
“York West End (Junior High School) has a whole wing that is not available to be occupied because of structural problems, but it’s a big school that was built decades ago, so you still had plenty of room because there were so few students,” Mackey said. “Nevertheless, you’ve got this whole section of the building that you can’t even go in, and which always is, to me, that’s a safety concern, even though we don’t have students housed there. And then Livingston Junior High, the other school, actually was condemned.”
Even Sumter Central High School, where the consolidated campus will be, is an older building, but HVAC replacements and minor renovations will keep it updated. Burroughs said the state replaced 30 HVACs in the building when they intervened two years ago, and the process was still ongoing during the summer.
Sumter County Schools was the first of three school systems under Mackey’s control, joined by Bessemer City Schools south of  Birmingham and Dallas County Schools in Selma.

Why the state intervened
The Sumter intervention, Mackey said, is unique because of how rural the county is. Sumter County, like many Black Belt counties, has seen significant population loss over the last few decades. The county lost 10.3% of its population from 2010 to 2020, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
That creates challenges. The falling population and difficulty accessing Sumter, on the state’s western border with Mississippi, makes it difficult to recruit teachers and staff. York Central High School has had three principals since the state intervened, Mackey said.
“There’s been a lot of teacher turnover too, and it’s hard to get people to drive there,” Mackey said. “There’s not a lot of housing in the community, so that’s been a struggle for them for a long time, and it’s been a little bit of a struggle even with the intervention.”
Although the construction of the consolidated campus is set to be completed in the next six months, Mackey said there will still be more work to do before the system’s autonomy is restored. One of those things is finances. 
John Heard, the state appointed chief administrative officer for the intervention, said in a recent interview that the system did not have their financials in line before intervention. Now, though, the school system has about four months worth of expenses in reserve, Heard said, about $6.2 million.
“That means they’re gonna have longevity in being able to do a good job keeping up with their finances,” Heard said.
Kinterbish Junior High School in Cuba, Alabama, the first school that was closed in 2023, had less than 70 students in 2022, according to state data. Mackey said the low membership overextended the school system’s staff and cost the district money. Those students were consolidated with York West End Junior High School in December 2023, which brought membership up to 276 students at the end of the 2023-24 school year, according to state data.
“They were overextended in the number of schools. That’s one of the real issues why they got into so many financial issues,” Mackey said. “It’s been one of their academic problems because they were trying to get teachers at all these different little schools and and it was really too much to staff.”
Another issue Mackey had was board governance. He said 18-24 months before the state intervened it recommended the closure of Kinterbish. The board, Mackey said, did not act on the recommendation.
“They were headed toward bankruptcy, and the things that had to be done to keep the system, solve it, mostly closing schools,” Mackey said. “I’m not saying they’re not willing. They were not able to get to the place where they could do it on their own.”
Even with consolidating schools, the system’s membership continues to decline. In the 2021-22 school year, Sumter County Schools had 1,068 students, according to state data. At the end of the 2023-24 school year, the school system had 910 students. Mackey said that some of the student movement is due to students attending University Charter School in the county, which enrolls 691 students.
Academics were also a concern. Sumter County Schools has been one of the state’s lowest performing schools for years, he said. In 2022, the system scored a 70 on the state report card and a 74 in 2024, according to state data. In 2024, the state average was an 85. 
In this year’s state reading test for second and third graders, 47% of Sumter’s second graders and 34% of third graders scored below the proficiency mark, which was raised nine points last year. Third graders system-wide are in the bottom ten school systems in proficiency. In the 2024 test, 40% of Sumter’s second graders and 19% of third graders scored below the proficiency mark.
“That’s a concern for all of us, that we make sure that we reach that goal and exceed it, really,” Heard said. “So there’s gonna be a lot of effort this year to spend more time working on that, to have some side by side coaching with students and teachers.”
Although focus is currently on construction and renovations, Mackey said that once the elementary school wing on Sumter Central High School’s campus is done they will be focusing more on academics.
He said Burroughs, who was appointed superintendent of Sumter County Schools two months before intervention, has an “academic mind” and will be able to improve the system’s academics.
“I think if we can get the other pieces taken care of, then she’ll be able to manage the academics,” he said.

Staff and community support
Burroughs and Heard said that they have not heard of any outright opposition to the intervention; however, they have heard some community members say they feel they’ve lost their voice.
“I think just the idea that the state is actually running the system does have some angst in some people,” Heard said. “I think a lot of people are excited about the fact that they’re getting a new facility.”
Board President Elanor James said in a recent interview that the progress the schools system has made would not have been possible without the state, but parents are wary of the future.
“There’s pros and cons to anything. Some say that they are happy that the state is here because we’re getting a new school, which we probably wouldn’t have gotten if the state intervention hadn’t come in,” James said. “Then some are kind of wary about it, they feel that the schools were doing OK.”
Sumter County teachers and staff said in interviews that they supported the intervention. 
Carla Landrum, a first grade teacher in the district, said she’s noticed teachers being more focused since intervention started.
“Everybody came in with a purpose. We knew what our kids needed. We wanted to make sure that that’s what they were getting,” Landrum said during the June site visit.
Natalie Adams, a second grade teacher, said the additional hands-on resources from the state have yielded a noticeable difference in the kids’ learning and engagement.
“I like them to collaborate so they can get an understanding that if they work together, someone may know something that someone else may know, may not know,” Adams said. “When they work together, it seems to work better for them.”
Burroughs said in a phone interview in June that intervention stabilized “finance, governance and academic oversight.”
“I had just gotten hired in July, and the state intervened in August, so it was kind of sort of like we came in both at the same time and we were able to develop a partnership.”
Heard accredits the success of the intervention to Mackey and the support from state personnel.
“Dr. Mackey had really committed his staff to just support us 100% whatever we needed, whether it was federal programs, whether it was a finance department, whether it was career tech,” Heard said. “He pretty much made his entire staff available to us for whatever we needed to make certain that we were doing the best possible approach for whatever we were doing.”
Mackey said he plans for the intervention to last another year or two, and hopes to be out in 2027.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9569-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Now the practice of frequent redistricting is raising the possibility that a stalled ballot measure to create an independent redistricting commission in Nevada could be resurrected, and if successful, trickle down to local governments.
Councilwoman Carrie Cox, who is running for reelection next year, suggests the council is rejiggering the maps with an eye toward boosting prospects for her opponent, Nevada State Board of Education member Annette Dawson Owens, who has been endorsed by Cox’s fellow council members.
“When you have colleagues that do the things that I’ve had done to me, it’s an easy trip to know that something’s going on,” Cox said at the City Council meeting Tuesday, where she cast the lone vote against the redistricting plan recommended by staff.
Bad blood flows freely on the Henderson Council. 
“Every two weeks there’s a pattern, if you haven’t figured it out, with a false narrative right before a City Council meeting,” Councilwoman Monica Larson, the newest member of the council, said from the dais, referring to Cox. “The narrative spun was gerrymandering, but what I appropriately call it is grandstanding.”
“That’s absolutely not true,” Cox said Friday. “Review the City Council meeting recordings on the website. The only pattern is the rest of the council voting against me when I stand up for my constituents.” 
Larson, a California transplant, campaigned last year on the promise of aligning with Cox to turn back an “insular cabal” — a Las Vegas Review-Journal reference in its 2024 endorsement of Larson — of Mayor Michelle Romero and three council members who routinely voted in lockstep. 
Instead of teaming with Cox, Larson cozied up to Romero, Councilman Dan Stewart, and Councilman Jim Seebock. 
On Wednesday, Romero called out Cox’s campaign for issuing a news release that asserts there is “strong evidence that the mayor had authorized the use of internally crafted population estimates” for the redistricting effort.   
“Either the person making these statements has a profound lack of understanding of both our charter and our city operations, or they have purposefully misled the public with these statements,” Romero said. 
Reapportionment and redistricting efforts are conducted nationwide every ten years, following the completion of the U.S. Census, to ensure congressional and legislative districts represent roughly the same amount of residents.  
Unlike most Nevada municipalities, which rely on the Census to determine population, in 2013, Henderson, the second-fastest growing city in Nevada at the time (behind Las Vegas), won legislative approval to change its charter to let the city’s own demographer estimate each ward’s population. When the number of residents in one ward varies by more than 5% from another, the city must redraw its maps. 
The population of Ward Three exceeds that of Ward Four by 7.8% and the population of Ward Two exceeds that of Ward Four by 5.6%, according to Henderson’s longtime Demographer Andy Powell.  
“If we were, for instance, to go 10 years without redistricting, given the high rate of growth that we’ve seen, we could see upwards of 20, 25% difference in population between some of some of the wards, and that would effectively serve to dilute the voting power” of residents in faster-growing wards, Powell said at Wednesday’s meeting. 
The city redrew its ward maps in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2021, 2023, and 2025.
Cox says this is the second time Henderson has tweaked her ward since she was elected in 2022. 
“They once again tried to move over 40,000 residents, many of them my voters,” she said Friday.   
Henderson grew by 22% in the decade ending December 2023, according to a study based on the U.S. Census data. But growth has slowed. For the year ending in June 2024, the most recent data available from the state demographer, Henderson’s population of 350,706 grew by 2.6%. 
City staff presented two redistricting options to the council. 
Plan One would have affected 40,000 residents, or 11% of the population by moving a dozen precincts. Three precincts that were moved in 2023 would have moved again. 
Plan Two accomplished the same goal of reducing the disparity between ward population by moving one precinct of roughly 4,500 residents (1.4% of the city’s population) out of Cox’s Ward Three. 
The two plans submitted to the council by Henderson staff raise questions about the motivation behind the redistricting effort and the veracity of the city’s internal estimates, which some experts challenged, 
Voting rights advocate Sondra Cosgrove, among others, wondered why Henderson officials floated a plan to move 40,000 residents when the alternative — moving 4,500 residents to another ward — achieves the same outcome. 
“City staff followed industry best practices and the City Charter requirements to develop the proposed redistricting maps,” Henderson spokeswoman Madeleine Skains said via email. “Staff selected two plans for consideration because they minimize impact, best achieve population balance and align with the best practices and Charter requirements. Both plans were provided to give City Council options to balancing these priorities.”
Romero, who is also seeking reelection next year, did not respond to inquiries about whether she requested two plans. 
“I cannot see how moving one precinct from one ward into another is political,” Stewart said, as he made a motion to approve Plan Two, which passed four to one. 
Former Henderson Police Chief Hollie Chadwick, who is challenging Romero in the race for mayor, declined to say whether she believes Henderson should return to redistricting every 10 years. 
“If you’re continually being moved between one ward and another, voters don’t know who represents them,” says Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada professor who heads up Fair Maps Nevada PAC. The group has unsuccessfully tried to let voters decide if an independent redistricting commission is better suited than state lawmakers to draw the lines for legislative and congressional districts. 
In 2020, the pandemic put a crimp in Fair Map’s effort to collect signatures to put the redistricting revamp on the ballot. In 2024, the Nevada Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that struck down two similar initiatives slated for the ballot that year. The ruling in favor of a Democratic voter found the measures created a commission with no source of funding. 
Although the ballot measure doesn’t affect redistricting of local governments, Cosgrove says given the power of the state in Nevada over local governments, a successful effort to include a redistricting commission in the constitution could prompt the Legislature to direct cities and counties to follow suit, and redraw maps every 10 years. 
Sept. 1 is the first day to file constitutional amendment ballot questions. 
“We’ve been going back and forth about what’s the best approach to not get sued,” Cosgrove said Thursday regarding the measure’s potential ressurrection. “And right now, I don’t care about that anymore. Based on what’s happening in Texas, everybody sees how bad it is.”

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
A soon-to-be law regulates SC sales of a psychoactive herb. No, it’s not marijuana.

This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
In South Carolina, a law signed in May after passing both chambers unanimously bans stores from selling kratom to anyone under 21. For legal sales to adults, kratom products must have “clear” labeling that includes ingredients, the amount of kratom, recommended amount for safe usage, and servings per container. The law also bans the sale of kratom products mixed with other things.
The law took effect July 11, exactly 60 days after Gov. Henry McMaster signed it.
The two-month delay was designed to give owners of the stores that sell the products time to comply, said the law’s author, state Sen. Russell Ott, D-St. Matthews.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers.
Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
44 more people charged with trafficking drugs in SC fentanyl overdose investigation

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21.
But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)U.S. Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus recently asked attorneys for Alabama a direct question: Why should we ignore the past?
This happened during a hearing on Alabama’s congressional district maps. Marcus and his two colleagues — U.S. district judges Anna Manasco and Terry Moorer, both Trump appointees — ruled in May that the state discriminated against Black voters by approving a 2023 map that gave those Alabamians little chance of electing their preferred leaders.
As the court considered sanctions, Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour argued that the judges could only impose preclearance, or judicial review of future congressional maps, if they found numerous violations of the 14th and 15th amendments, which address congressional representation and voting rights. The Legislature’s actions in 2023, LaCour said, were unlike the “unremitting and ingenious defiance that made it nearly impossible for Black voters in the South to register to vote.”
“I hear you that to a certain extent, states should be given some ability to be viewed as actors with clean hands,” Marcus replied. “But the state of Alabama shouldn’t be divorced from its history, should it?”
I can answer that. No. A thousand times no.
Look at the history of Alabama from 1901 to 2025. You can’t find any example of Alabama officials helping or even allowing Black Alabamians to vote without federal or judicial intervention. Left to their own devices, they put up obstacles. And worse.
Our state government exists to let powerful elites act without restraint. Alabama leaders have spent over a century demanding that same level of deference from the federal government, the only force that ever made our leaders pay attention to citizens outside the country clubs.
And in that quest, the elites have had a powerful ally: the U.S. Supreme Court.
In 1903, Black Alabamians presented the nation’s high court with transcripts of Alabama’s 1901 constitutional convention, in which leaders said without caveat or dissembling that they planned to disenfranchise Black voters and defy the spirit of the Reconstruction amendments. In the face of this tyranny, the justices claimed they had no power to enforce the U.S. Constitution. At least as applied to Black Americans.
Sure, there were 15 years where the Warren Court acted responsibly. The justices upheld the Voting Rights Act in 1966 in the face of a lawsuit from South Carolina (in which Alabama officials filed a brief on behalf of the Palmetto State).
But that was the eye of the hurricane.
In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which required the U.S. Department of Justice to approve any voting law changes made by Alabama and other states with long histories of racial discrimination. That’s preclearance. Chief Justice John Roberts, siding with a group of Shelby County plaintiffs who challenged the law, wrote that the country “had changed.”
In the next decade, Alabama lawmakers made Roberts look like a sucker or a conspirator. Since the 2013 decision, Alabama has banned drop boxes used by voters with disabilities and criminalized some forms of absentee ballot assistance.
And look at the last two years. Marcus, Manasco and Moorer ordered the Legislature in 2023 to draw two districts where Black voters had an opportunity to elect their preferred leaders. The Legislature responded with a nonresponsive map. And that, as Alabama House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said at the time, was deliberate. They intended to ignore the lower court and win an appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The state lost that time. Last week, the court ordered the state to keep the current congressional map in place through the 2030 Census.
But the nation’s highest court now appears ready to ride to our leaders’ rescue.
The justices earlier this month ordered the parties in a Louisiana redistricting case to brief them on whether majority-minority districts violate the 14th and 15th amendments.
This is a bad sign for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the last shred of the law remaining. Section 2 bans voting laws that discriminate based on race. It was critical in Alabama’s redistricting case. The lower court judges ruled that since Alabama voting is racially polarized — with white Alabamians tending to support Republicans and Black Alabamians tending to support Democrats — the Legislature’s preferred map swamped Black voters and didn’t give them an actual voice in the political process. Hence, the two districts.
Declare those unconstitutional, and Black Alabama voices in Congress will be silenced. The Republicans who control our government will not hesitate to draw seats to ensure our delegation is all GOP and all-white.
What would stop them?
This is not a government that works for its people. This is a regime that protects the privilege of the powerful. It sees popular opinion as a threat to be siphoned off or contained. Left to their own devices, Alabama officials will always make it difficult for Alabamians to govern themselves.
And sadly, you don’t have to go very far back in the past to find examples of that.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Friday_maps_20-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.

Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Progressives and voting rights advocates are divided on whether California and New York should fight the Texas power grab by gerrymandering their own states, creating more safe Democratic seats, even if that means undermining fair maps and the authority of those states’ nonpartisan redistricting commissions.
In Wisconsin, which just got out from under one of the worst partisan gerrymanders in the U.S., and the impenetrable, outsized Republican majorities in the state Legislature it protected for a decade and a half, this issue hits particularly close to home.
It’s head-spinning to hear arguments for Democratic counter-gerrymandering in other states from the same people in Wisconsin who were recently crying out for fair maps.
If Democrats are going to mount a serious challenge to the fascist takeover of our country by Trump and his minions, it’s hard to see how ceding the moral high ground and running roughshod over the principle that the will of the majority of voters should prevail is going to help.
I get that it’s more satisfying to imagine a quick fix to the fascist takeover of every branch of government than to listen to a lot of vague talk about long-term plans to rebuild democracy. After all, election deniers and the architects of the Jan. 6 attack are now running the federal government, demanding access to voter lists across the country and deploying the FBI to arrest political opponents, including the Texas Democrats who’ve fled their state to stall the gerrymandering scheme there.
But here in Wisconsin, where we’ve just finally beaten back the most gerrymandered map in the country, it’s depressing to imagine Democrats abandoning the high ground and scrambling to do exactly what Republicans did when they controlled all three branches of government, attempting to lock in permanent political control against the will of the people.
If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law.
In this most extreme political moment, with every public institution and the continued existence of U.S. democracy in doubt, I understand why the long view frustrates people. The emergency is now. I understand that many voters want to see Democrats “fight fire with fire,” as Newsom put it.
But consider this: Republicans control more state legislatures (28 Republican versus 18 controlled by Democrats) and have trifecta control of all branches of government in more states (23 all-GOP states versus 15 all-Democratic). JD Vance just launched a tour of Republican states to encourage more mid-decade gerrymandering. And Trump wants to hold a new census for the purpose of redefining who can vote. Even if Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom and Kathy Hochul succeed in gerrymandering California and New York, Democrats are not likely to win the nationwide redistricting war.
Meanwhile, democracy will be the first casualty of that war. California and New York would have to suspend the work of their nonpartisan redistricting commissions — the gold standard for fair, nonpartisan map-drawing — and take back partisan control of the process in order to carry out their threats. If they succeed, it is beyond unlikely that the politicians who pull off that short-term victory will ever cede back their power over the voting maps to the nonpartisan commissions again.
On a deeper level, the Democratic gerrymandering fantasy takes the whole movement to oppose Trump in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of building grassroots support to counter an unpopular, authoritarian leader, it rigs the system to benefit a party whose whole problem is that it has lost the broad, popular support it needs to win elections and create a better, more enlightened government.
Instead of trying to rig the maps to ensure a Democratic House majority in the next election, Democrats need to focus on winning elections and flipping seats in areas of the rural and industrial Midwest that were once reliably blue but have turned deep red.
To do that they need to make the case that health care, education and an adequate social safety net are bedrock rights in the richest nation on earth, and that we should not be giving tax breaks to billionaires by taking food out of the mouths of hungry children.
They need to offer something to the farmers and factory workers and disaffected voters in rural and urban areas alike that is clearly different and better than the hate, corruption, and a determination to run roughshod over democracy that Republicans offer.
In Wisconsin, voting rights groups have been working on a campaign to push through a constitutional amendment modeled on one in our neighboring state of Michigan, to make sure that our voting maps are never again drawn up by partisan legislators.
That’s the kind of grassroots fight that helped Wisconsin finally overcome Republican gerrymandering. One important aspect of the fair maps movement is the way it engaged citizens to feel like participants, not spectators, in democracy, and to find their common interests instead of focusing on the politics of division. This, not more politicians in safe seats who don’t have to listen to voters, is what we need right now.
The battle to beat back fascism does not turn on a handful of Democrats in protected districts. It turns on an organized uprising by the majority of people in the U.S. who are willing to join together despite their differences because they are sick and tired of having their democracy stolen from them, along with their health, safety, opportunity and hope. There’s no short cut to leading that fight.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-11 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What is diquat? Here’s what to know about herbicide at the center of debate in CT,John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/11/diquat-army-corps-hydrilla/,Diquat is among the most common herbicides used on invasive plants. It's approved for use in the US by the Environmental Protections Agency.,"Throughout this summer, a debate has raged along the Connecticut River over a little known but widely used chemical herbicide: diquat.
The controversy kicked off in June when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced its plans to resume using diquat and other herbicides to combat the spread of invasive hydrilla along the river. Those plans were part of a years-long effort to study the effectiveness of using herbicides to control hydrilla. They quickly became the subject of viral social media posts. 
Here’s what to know about the herbicide, the Army Corps’ plans, and risks to the public:
What is diquat?
Diquat, or diquat dibromide, is a chemical herbicide that was first developed in England in the 1950s for use in agriculture. Diquat is a fast-acting, non-selective herbicide, meaning it can be used against a wide range of weeds, invasive plants and other target species.
Dr. Melissa Perry, dean of the College of Public Health at George Mason University, said diquat can be used as a “burndown” herbicide that is applied to soils before crops are planted in order to control weeds. In agriculture, it is most commonly used in growing potatoes, oil seed crops and vineyards, though Perry said diquat remains relatively rare for use on U.S. farms.
While it is known to persist in soils for a long time, diquat dissipates quickly in water — making it much more popular as an aquatic herbicide.
Despite some claims that have circulated online, Perry said that diquat is not related to Agent Orange, another herbicide that became infamous for its use by U.S. troops during the Vietnam War.
How is it being used in Connecticut?
In Connecticut, diquat is among the most common herbicides used to rid lakes and ponds of invasive plants such as hydrilla, water chestnut and Eurasian watermilfoil.
A total of 955 permits have been issued since 2022 allowing for the use of diquat in aquatic settings. 
The chemical works by destroying walls of plant cells from within and interrupting the photosynthesis process. Diquat is known to be especially effective against plants with weak root systems, like hydrilla, and is not as lethal to plants with stronger roots.
Typically, the herbicide is either sprayed at the surface level or it is mixed into a sinking solution that is injected under the water through hoses. The latter method is the one that the Army Corps of Engineers have employed as part of their ongoing studies on the Connecticut River.
That work began in 2023, when research scientists began placing dyes into the river to study its flow in order to determine what herbicides to use, in different concentrations, in areas afflicted by hydrilla. Based on those results, the Army Corps first started applying herbicides, including diquat, at five areas along the river last summer.
The Army Corps has recorded large declines in the amount of invasive hydrilla, with minimal impacts to native plants, as a result of that application. This summer, the hydrilla has returned in Chester Boat Basin and, to a larger extent, in Selden Cove, according to the Corps’ reports. Both sites were selected for additional treatments when the Corps’ resumes its studies this month.
What are the risks?
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the potential health risks from diquat are mostly associated with people who work with the chemical or apply it to their lawns and gardens.
The agency does not report any dietary or other post-application risks associated with exposure to treated water.
“The bottom line is, if the labeled directions are being followed, there are no concerns from people swimming or coming into contact with water that’s been treated with diquat,” said Anne Overstreet, the director of the EPA’s Pesticide Re-Evaluation Division.
Overstreet said that the agency has determined that diquat can be “mildly toxic” to fish and other aquatic wildlife that are not the intended targets of its treatment. Reports released by the agency said those effects can be mitigated by applying the herbicide underneath the water, as opposed to spraying it on the surface where it can more easily drift into other areas.
Due to the potential risk to people who handle diquat in undiluted concentrations, the EPA requires certain workers to wear protective clothing, including respirators and protective eyewear. 
Perry, the epidemiologist, said skin exposure can be toxic and ingesting diquat is “highly toxic,” interfering with the gut, its microbiome and other internal organs.
How is it regulated?
Diquat and other herbicides are approved for use in the U.S. by the EPA. The agency completed its most recent review of diquat in 2020, allowing its continued use in a variety of applications including lakes and waterways.
Diquat is also commercially available as an ingredient in several household landscaping products.
Critics of the Army Corps’ plans have frequently pointed out that diquat is banned in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Diquat lost its registration status in the E.U. in 2019, but it has been approved for emergency use dozens of times since, including in Ireland, Denmark and Hungary.
EPA is in charge of approving herbicides for the wider market, but Connecticut DEEP reviews and approves any requests to apply diquat or other chemicals within the state’s waterways. As part of its approval process, DEEP requires users post signs letting people know when it’s safe to swim, fish or use the water for irrigation purposes.
What are the alternatives?
Other methods for combating invasive aquatic plants include the use of mechanical harvesters or large mats to block sunlight, preventing plants from growing.
Due to the costs and inability to target specific plants without also impacting large numbers of native species, Army Corps officials determined that neither option was suitable for use along the Connecticut River.
In 2017, voters in New Fairfield adopted an ordinance to prevent officials from using diquat and other herbicides to combat a similar infestation of invasive weeds on Candlewood Lake. As an alternative to using herbicides, the Candlewood Lake Authority began introducing sterile grass carp to feed on watermilfoil and other weeds. Between 2015 and 2017, more than 8,000 carp were stocked into the lake.
Those actions effectively controlled excess vegetation, Mark Howarth, the CLA’s executive director, said in an email. But in 2022, “there was a big shift in the lake and virtually all of the vegetation was eliminated,” including native species, Howarth said. The die-off was attributed to both the voracious carp and the annual lowering of water levels by the lake’s owner, FirstLight Energy. As as result, DEEP has been working to remove the carp from the lake until the vegetation can recover.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5345047.jpg,,,2025-08-11 07:57:11.236088

They came with promises of transformation: thousands of jobs, surging salaries and a foothold in the booming electric vehicle market.
Imola Automotive USA, a Boca Raton, Florida-based startup, pitched officials in small, struggling towns in Georgia, Oklahoma and Arkansas on a bold vision. The company planned to build six EV plants, create 45,000 jobs —  and help these impoverished communities secure a place in America’s green future.
But more than 18 months later, the company hasn’t broken ground on a single site. And its top executive — whose background is in television and athletic shoes, not automotive manufacturing — has gone silent.
A Floodlight investigation did not uncover lost taxpayer money in Fort Valley, Georgia; Langston, Oklahoma; or Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Imola has sought free land, municipal financing and other incentives for its shifting proposals. 
But an economic development watchdog said the episode illustrates how the frenzy to land electric vehicle jobs can leave economically distressed towns vulnerable to empty promises.

(Kenneth C. Zirkel via Wikimedia)
Imola CEO Rodney Henry declined requests for an interview. He responded to Floodlight’s inquiries with a short statement, insisting the company had not given up on its plans, which have included a partnership with an Italian manufacturer of two-seat electric vehicles. 
“Our timetable has been modified due to matters outside of our control,” Henry said in a statement. “We are highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment. Due to proprietary consideration as well as NDA (nondisclosure) agreements, we are not at liberty to discuss specifics at this juncture.”
That’s a stark shift from the company’s earlier promises. In a press release issued in January 2024, Henry claimed the company had already secured land in multiple states to build half a dozen plants and create tens of thousands of jobs. 
Could someone with no experience in car manufacturing really deliver that?
“It’s ludicrous,” said Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and analyzes economic development projects. 
Building large auto plants, he said, requires “a great deal of capital, a great deal of management skill, a great deal of engineering and marketing chops. And obviously, Tesla developed those, but they didn’t do it overnight, right?”
Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff weren’t the only towns swept up in the competition to attract electric vehicle plants. Spurred by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions in private investment and expanded government incentives, local officials across the country scrambled to land high-paying manufacturing jobs and a slice of the booming clean energy economy.
Since the IRA passed in 2022, more than 150 EV plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for economic development good for the environment.
But that rush may be grinding to a halt. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” rolls back many federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles. The law is already throwing the EV sector into turmoil — threatening to stall or shrink the kinds of ambitious projects towns like Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that plans for 14 EV-related plants have been canceled this year.
  Imola Automotive USA President Rodney Henry said in early 2024 that his company had chosen Langston, Okla., and Pine Bluff, Ark., as sites for their electric vehicle plants because they were close to universities. That, he said, would create career opportunities for residents and students of Langston University, a historically Black college. The plans in Langston, however, have been canceled. (Website for Langston, Okla.)
Bold promises, then silence
In three towns where Imola pledged massive investment, there’s no sign of construction and little more than confusion.
Langston — a town of 1,600 where more than 35% of residents live in poverty — never saw Imola’s plans take shape.
A 2023 letter to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus stated that the company had run into “multiple obstacles,” including trouble acquiring enough land.
“In order for us to continue moving forward on the project we are requesting that the City of Langston convey to us any and all vacant properties owned by the city,” Pettus wrote.
Langston City Council member Magnus Scott said the company also asked the town to issue municipal bonds to help them build their plant. Since then, he said, a company representative told him the deal had been canceled. 
“I guess maybe they ran into financial problems,” Scott said.
Reached by phone, Pettus, of south Florida, said he’s no longer employed by Imola but instead works as a consultant for the company. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he declined to discuss Imola’s plans.
Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers.

Since then, however, there has been no sign of construction. (Fort Valley State University)
A year later, with no sign of progress on the plant, the company came back to the Georgia town with an entirely different proposal. This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town. 
One city council member balked.
“You want us to sign an agreement for 99 years before you bring us the car company,” said council member Laronda Eason, according to minutes of the March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait and switch.” 
Eason did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment on the Imola proposal.
In Pine Bluff, where per capita income last year was just over $21,000, city officials were initially all in. Writing to Henry in August 2024, then-Mayor Shirley Washington said the city of 39,000 stood ready to buy land, build infrastructure and issue industrial revenue bonds to support Imola’s vision. 
“With an anticipated employment base of more than 8,000 jobs,” Washington wrote, “we firmly believe this investment will marshal a pivotal turning point in our community.” 
But a year later, the project hasn’t moved. 
“We never did get off the ground with that,” Washington said in a brief phone interview.
 LeRoy said Imola’s pitch fits a troubling pattern.
“It grabs me as an example of how the craze among governors and mayors to get the next big thing has caused some sloppy vetting,” he said of the struggling communities courted by Imola. 
Such towns, he said, are “easy prey. …They’re desperate.”

Grand vision, missing details
Henry, who lives in Florida, touts a background as a longtime TV executive producer and the founder of Protégé, an athletic footwear brand. He claims on his IMDB profile that Protégé donated a million pairs of shoes to African nations.
But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress. 
Floodlight found the website for Imola — named after the Italian city where Tazzari EVs are made — is no longer accessible without a password. A search of the Tazzari website found no mention of plants in the United States. But a 2024 version of the Imola site mentions the tiny vehicles “coming soon to America.”
In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership. 
The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren’t designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company’s Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company’s webpage.
  These are some of the electric two-seater micro cars made by the Tazzari Group. The Italian firm and Imola Automotive USA jointly announced plans for a partnership in early 2024 as Imola promised to build electric vehicle plants in economically struggling U.S. towns. There’s no sign of progress so far. (Tazzari Group’s website)
Tazzari didn’t respond to email messages from a Floodlight reporter.
Henry said at the time that the company chose Langston and Fort Valley because of their universities. 
“Both of these locations are ideal,” he said in the January 2024 news release, “as their proximity to communities with institutions of higher learning, will allow residents and students career opportunities in the fast growing EV Technology and Innovation Industry.” 
Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston and Pine Bluff did not respond to interview requests. Few documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.
But it’s clear from available records that Imola’s promises stirred hope. 
Langston Mayor Michael Boyles called the proposal “transformative” in a January 2024 news release.
But some local leaders soon began to question the details.
Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, said parts of the plan didn’t add up. How, for instance, would the company house more than 1,000 workers in such a small town? And how were they going to build such a large plant on land without utilities or water?
Her doubts deepened when she learned that Imola wanted to lock down land agreements without putting up any earnest money.
“My early feeling was that, ‘Something is not quite okay with this,’ ” she said. “But I think the hope for our community kind of outweighed the ability to just take things slow and look at them for where they are and what they are — versus where you hope them to be.”
Eventually, the promise fizzled. 
“It was disappointing,” Johnson said. “…We could have had our energy and time focused on something that seemed more valid and more substantial.”
  In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA promised that it would build an electric vehicle plant in Fort Valley, Ga., that would employ 7,500 people — and pay average wages of $45 an hour. The promises have raised hopes in the economically struggling town, but there’s little indication they will be fulfilled. (Michael Rivera via Wikimedia)
Still waiting for the shovels
Some residents in Fort Valley are still holding out hope.
Mayor Jeffery Lundy said early last year that it was a “priority for my administration to land a company like Imola Automotive USA.” Local officials, he said, were looking forward to the economic boost the plant would bring.
At the time, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and open the plant within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph. 
During a February 2024 town hall meeting, Imola officials told residents that the plant would pay employees an average of $45 an hour, according to a Facebook post. Commenters buzzed with excitement, with one writing: “Application me !!!!” 
Pettus told a local TV station that most jobs would require only a high school diploma.
In early 2024, Fort Valley rezoned land to accommodate the plant, and the city council signed off on the deal. But more than 15 months later, there’s still no sign of construction. 
Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting. A spokesman for Georgia Power said that while the utility doesn’t discuss economic development projects, “We’re prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.” 
Makita Driver, one of the Facebook commenters who’d voiced excitement about the proposed EV plant, said there’s no doubt she would have applied for one of the jobs there — had the facility ever been built.
“The pay rate was really what got my attention,” she said.
As a medical assistant, Driver said she earns far less than what Imola had promised. But she eventually concluded the promises were too good to be true.
“Who really makes that kind of money starting out?” she asked.
In a brief interview with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy said he’s still in contact with Henry.
“We are patiently waiting for that groundbreaking,” Lundy said.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa PBS)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.
The letter was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard.
This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.
This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter.
According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there were 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of September 2023.
South Carolina joined the list in February 2024, when Gov. Henry McMaster signed the ESG Pension Protection Act.
Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.
“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.
The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 22 other states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”
“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting.
The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”
South Carolina’s anti-ESG law requires the Retirement System Investment Commission to make investment decisions based only on “pecuniary factors” — in other words, what’s expected to net the most money — without giving weight to policies such as climate change and social impacts. During a public hearing, the commission’s CEO told legislators nothing would change, since the agency already operated that way.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)From 8% to 100%, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce recently graded Indiana lawmakers on their support of major business legislation in the recent General Assembly session.
The 41st annual Legislator Scorecard was based on how legislators voted on 12 key “pro-economy, pro-jobs” policies. The most significant of the bills was Senate Bill 1, which reduced property taxes — including a break for businesses.
Other key bills included the topics of road funding, education deregulation, economic development, child care, energy generation, higher education and workforce development and health care costs.
“The Legislator Scorecard is a critical measure to track lawmakers’ commitment to keeping our state among the nation’s best for doing business – which also leads to increased economic growth and job opportunities,” said Indiana Chamber President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders. “The legislation that factored into the 2025 rankings was especially important in creating a more attractive tax climate, building our talent pipeline and maintaining needed road infrastructure.”
More than 50 lawmakers earned a perfect mark — all Republicans who generally align with the right-leaning Chamber of Commerce.
Many Republicans were in the 90 percentile, including Fort Wayne Sen. Liz Brown who scored 91%. Her four-year average is 89%. She has recently been targeted as being too liberal and faces a primary fight in 2026 against Allen County school board member Darren Vogt. He is backed by Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Banks.
There were a number of Republicans below 80%. They include Rep. Craig Haggard at 62%; Rep. Matt Hostettler at 75%; Rep. Andrew Ireland at 50%; Rep. Lorissa Sweet at 70%; Rep. Ethan Manning at 75%; Sen. Eric Bassler at 64%; Sen. Vaneta Becker at 42%; Sen. Gary Byrne at 62%; Sen. Spencer Deery at 69%; Sen. Dan Dernulc at 54%; Sen. Aaron Freeman at 54%; Sen. Tyler Johnson at 62%; Sen. Jean Leising; Sen. Jim Tomes at 46%; Sen. Michael Young at 42% and Sen. Andy Zay at 38%.
Some common bills that cost these lawmakers were ‘no’ votes on road funding and property tax relief.
The lower scores largely were assigned to Democrats, though the worst grade went to GOP Indianapolis Sen. Mike Bohacek.
Other awards
Seven policymakers also were further selected as an Indiana Chamber Legislative Champion, Small Business Champion or Champion Freshman Legislator.
The Legislative Champions are Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, and Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, for their respective work on pro-business legislation in 2025, namely on the topics of road funding and taxation, respectively.
Additionally, three Small Business Champions were named: Rep. Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne; Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers;  and Rep. Craig Snow, R-Warsaw.
The Indiana Chamber also honored Rep. Wendy Dant Chesser, D-Jeffersonville, and Rep. Danny Lopez, R-Carmel, as Champion Freshman Legislators for their impacts on boosting entrepreneurship and economic development.
The Legislator Scorecard (formerly Legislative Vote Analysis) is produced annually after the legislative session, the news released said. Lawmakers are kept apprised of the Indiana Chamber position and reasoning on these bills through various communications during the legislative session – and prior to key votes being taken. Only floor votes for which there is a public record are used in the vote calculations.

Bill Lee was all smiles on July 28 as he announced the Boring Company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, has plans to build a 10-mile tunnel connecting Nashville International Airport with downtown Nashville.

Bill Lee and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announce a plan for Elon Musk's Boring Company to build an underground tunnel from the airport to Downtown Nashville. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee was all smiles on July 28 as he announced the Boring Company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, has plans to build a 10-mile tunnel connecting Nashville International Airport with downtown Nashville.
The “Music City Loop,” as the project has been dubbed, will transport riders in electric vehicles, and if the project is anything like a similar Boring “Loop” in Las Vegas, the cars will all be Teslas, as Musk also owns Tesla. 
The company website says it creates tunnels to “solve the problem of soul destroying traffic,” and Lee said the project “will transform the way people travel from the airport to downtown Nashville.”
Aside from the Looney Tunes-Wile E. Coyote-sounding aspect of the project, the potential environmental impacts of boring through Middle Tennessee’s limestone — even Boring CEO Steve Davis admitted construction would be challenging —  and the company’s poor track record — it has managed to complete only one similar project, in Las Vegas, while projects in Illinois, Maryland, Florida and California have all been busts — there’s another topic on my mind. 
Hypocrisy, or, perhaps, lack thereof. 
My first thought was that Lee’s support for the project is hypocritical: After all, Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers have repeatedly over the last decade sneered at and stomped on efforts by Nashville leaders to enact mass transit plans geared toward alleviating the city’s growing traffic snarls while simultaneously stripping the city’s power.
Nashville, Tennessee voters green light transit tax

In 2012, Nashville Mayor Karl Dean pitched a plan for bus rapid transit (BRT), which allows buses to use dedicated lanes down the center of streets, expediting travel time: BRT is one of the simplest and most effective methods for expanding municipal transit. More than half of U.S. states implement BRT — including conservative states like Alabama, Florida and Texas.
The plan wasn’t perfect, but it was a starting point, aimed at connecting East and West Nashville. Nonetheless, it drew pushback from conservative political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity and subsequently from Tennessee Republicans. 
Former state Rep. Jeremy Durham, a Franklin Republican, crafted a measure in 2014 that would give the state the final say on any BRT project, whether state funds were used or not. Not only did that project, known as The Amp, die, but the law continues to impede Nashville’s transit plans: despite the city’s voters approving by a large margin a new tax to pay for transit improvements, city leaders will still need state approval to add transit on state roads. 
More recently, the GOP-legislature has enacted measure after preemptive measure designed to strip power from Nashville’s Metro Council and governing boards — including the Airport Authority and Convention Center Authority  — and to cut the size of Metro Council in half.
So, yes, supporting this boondoggle for billionaires and tourists may, at first glance, appear hypocritical based on past opposition to transit, but after thinking this over, I would argue that it’s 100% on brand for Lee and the state lawmakers who zoomed approval for a no-cost lease of state property to the Musk company. 
The Lee administration has failed to find solutions — or in some cases, even to try to find them — for issues important to Tennesseans. Since Lee was elected in 2018, he has raised no concern about the number of Tennesseans who lack health insurance. The Tennessee Justice Center, a nonprofit public advocacy organization, estimates about 300,000 people in the state aren’t covered by TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program, as lawmakers have refused to take a federal Medicaid expansion enacted in the Obama administration.
Gun safety? A nonstarter. After a 2023 school shooting, Lee held a special legislative session ostensibly devoted to creating safer laws around gun possession. Little was accomplished other than an agreement to apply $50 million to community mental health programs — a good start, but the funds were pulled from the already overburdened TennCare.
Then there’s the Department of Children’s Services. The state has been woefully slow to find solutions for the problem of having kids in state custody sleeping on the floor of office buildings. And although Lee has touted adoption as a solution to the number of children in foster care, Anita Wadhwani recently reported about a family who adopted a child with mental health needs, only to be thwarted in their attempts to find him help and threatened with child abandonment charges. 
Kids in state custody forced to sleep on floors in state office building

Finally, we have the Middle Tennessee issue of, yes, soul-destroying traffic. 
The area around Nashville is in dire need of mass transit to navigate the three interstates that run through the city. Commutes from Murfreesboro up the I-24 corridor during rush hour are legendary for bumper-to-bumper traffic. To get from Franklin to Nashville — around 18 miles — easily takes an hour. 
What does Lee give us? Toll lanes, couched as “choice lanes,” meaning you have the choice to pay extra money to travel in a less trafficked lane, and now this Musk-backed absurdity. 
Spare me the governor’s platitudes about how the Musk tunnel project will streamline traffic: I feel confident a tunnel for Teslas connecting the airport with downtown will offer little benefit to residents of Nashville and none to commuters who live in surrounding counties, but will put money in the pockets of people who least need it.
Another idea that doesn’t benefit Tennesseans? There’s no hypocrisy: That’s Lee to a tee.

They came to denounce the impact to patients, families and workers if Republicans cut Medicaid, health care and SNAP to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for SEIU)When we hear about health policy changes in the news, usually the numbers we hear are related to insurance: How many people will become insured or uninsured as a result of the latest legislation? Analysts — and as a result, news reporters, too — tend to use these numbers because they’re relatively simple to predict and understand.
But at the end of the day, health insurance is just a little card legally linked to a thick stack of paperwork in some office somewhere. Insurance numbers don’t really tell us much about what we actually want to know, which is the human health impact. How many medically avoidable deaths will a given piece of legislation prevent or cause? How many will or won’t get the care they need? How many more will or won’t be in medical debt?
Congress passed and on July 4 President Trump signed his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the largest ever cut to government health care funding in U.S. history. The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will push about 10 million Americans off of health insurance while growing the deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade.
Health economists have studied the link between health insurance and health outcomes and can estimate how many more preventable deaths Americans will suffer as health coverage declines, among other outcomes.
The Minnesota Department of Human Services recently released preliminary estimates that about 140,000 Minnesotans will lose their health insurance as a result of the legislation.
Additionally, due to upcoming subsidy expirations and rule changes for the Affordable Care Act’s insurance markets (“Obamacare”), health policy analysts at KFF have predicted an additional 5.1 million Americans will become uninsured nationwide, leading to an additional 13,000 uninsured Minnesotans.
Using this 153,000 figure, we can estimate that roughly one more Minnesotan will unnecessarily die per day as a result of losing coverage. Tens of thousands more will forego necessary care, miss medications, and rack up medical expenses they cannot afford.

Make no mistake, however. The craziest part of all of this should not be these figures themselves. It’s the fact that they can mostly still be prevented from coming to fruition by our state Legislature.
KFF estimates that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to cost the state up to $2.4 billion per year over the next decade, leaving a big hole for our state legislators to fill. Although some of these harms are caused by Congress’s imposition of work requirement paperwork burdens on Medicaid beneficiaries that the state cannot do much about, most of them come from the funding cuts, and funding cuts are something the state can definitely do something about. Minnesota just needs to come up with roughly $2.4 billion on its own.
How exactly can the state find such a large sum of money — roughly 6% of the state general fund budget? Believe it or not, it’s not actually that complicated. Currently, the state runs Medicaid through private third-party administrators called managed care organizations, or MCOs. These MCOs are a product of the 1990s, when the public policy world thought the problem with health care was that people were using too much of it, and health care needed gatekeepers.
It’s a rather evidence-free claim. Consider that Americans actually use less care than people in Europe and Canada despite spending far more per capita than them, all while also living shorter, less healthy lives. Nonetheless, the MCOs still run Minnesota’s Medicaid program, adding significant administrative expenses onto the state budget while doing nothing to make health care better.
Connecticut got rid of these wasteful MCO contractors in 2012, instead opting to run its Medicaid program itself. Unsurprisingly, they saved lots of money doing so. How much would Minnesota save if it spent per beneficiary what Connecticut does on Medicaid? About $1.5 billion annually, according to my analysis.
Given the $2.4 billion in cuts also includes some money cut from non-health care areas, that $1.5 billion in savings is likely enough to fill most of the health care-related hole in the state budget! With that money, the state can ensure tens of thousands of Minnesotans get the care they need while preventing closures of Minnesota hospitals and nursing homes that depend on Medicaid for funding.
During the last legislative session, I wrote a column in support of legislation called the Patient-Centered Care bill that would more or less copy what Connecticut did (SF1059/HF255). Unfortunately, neither the state House nor Senate brought it up for serious consideration.
Back then, it was admittedly still uncertain whether Congress would actually pass massive cuts to Medicaid, but it did, and now there are no more excuses. Our state Legislature can quite easily alleviate most of the financial problems Congress has passed onto it and thereby save lives.
All they have to do is pass a not very big but in my opinion quite beautiful bill to cut wasteful MCO middlemen out of our Medicaid program",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222312159.jpg,,,2025-08-11 07:57:11.236088

Mike Braun and Indiana State Police Superintendent Anthony Scott hold a news conference in the Statehouse on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)If you commit the “crime” of speaking Spanish in Indiana, watch your back. The Indiana State Police and Indiana National Guard are looking for you.
Gov. Mike Braun recently announced the Indiana State Police, Indiana Department of Correction and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security will join the Indiana National Guard in assisting the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement roundup of immigrants into the United States.
Braun said the state will make 1,000 beds available in the Miami Correctional Facility to imprison people who have been convicted of nothing and have been given no due process rights. The Marion County Sheriff has said he will go along with the order, in part because the federal government pays him per detainee, while the state does not.
This is an affront to anyone who values liberty, limited government and human dignity. It wastes police resources — and Hoosiers’ tax money — in diverting them from searching for and prosecuting crimes against person and property by actual criminals to instead round up peaceful people who are seeking a better life. Immigrants work in our farms, factories and communities, shop at our stores, and contribute positively to our state’s economy and culture.
It’s also a gross violation of the words Braun said on Jan. 13, when he placed his hand on a Bible and swore an oath to God and the people of Indiana that he would uphold and defend both the Indiana and United States Constitutions.
Indiana immigration arrests surge despite stalled ICE partnerships

Participating in President Trump’s scheme to systematically dismantle due process and the rule of law is a clear violation of that solemn oath.
While Braun and Trump claim this is a roundup of “violent illegal immigrants,” the witch hunt has gone far beyond that. Of those being arrested, 71% have no criminal convictions at all – and among those who do, most are for minor offenses – and only 8% have been convicted of violent crimes. The number of those without any conviction being arrested and detained keeps rising.
However, Trump has been eager to not just deport the “violent” criminals, but to round up anyone who is Latino, Asian or Middle Eastern, treating everyone as a potential illegal immigrant, to meet the quota of 3,000 arrests per day vocalized by White House adviser Stephen Miller, while the administration gleefully touts deplorable conditions in detention centers and violates due process rights.
To desperately reach that goal, it means rounding up people who aren’t criminals, but who have fled oppressive communist and socialist regimes and lawfully sought asylum, revoking visas and green cards for students without explanation, and sweeping up U.S. citizens and throwing them in jail.
People showing up for their visa appointments — doing the right thing in good faith — are being arrested in court and taken to faraway detention facilities where they know nobody and have little chance of contacting representation. One was a 20-year-old Purdue student from South Korea who was on an active student visa, but arrested, detained and shipped to Louisiana at her hearing.
This is the work of a banana republic, not a republic bound by a Constitution that has a very clear mandate to protect due process rights and a tradition of “innocent until proven guilty.”
Participating in such a system — and actively and enthusiastically doing so — is denying people their dignity, as well as their human rights.
Our beliefs
As Libertarians, we believe in the sovereignty of the individual and the freedom to live, work and move in peace.
A state government deputizing local and state officers to participate in a federal scheme of rounding up people for the sole crime of looking different or speaking with an accent, on the hopes of “finding illegals” violates that principle. It undermines state sovereignty and also sows distrust between our immigrant communities and local authorities.
The U.S. immigration system is irreparably broken. It is a Byzantine system with a number of hoops and steps someone must jump through to legally emigrate to the U.S., which incentivizes “illegal immigration,” and the Trump administration has doubled down on it by not only making legal immigration more difficult, but revoking visas and arresting and deporting people going through the process the right way for small paperwork errors.
Truly making America great would be living up to the words on the Statue of Liberty – “give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free” – not weaponizing local police to kidnap, detain and deport people trying to properly follow the system, while revoking visas and making the immigration system more difficult.
The Libertarian Party of Indiana calls for Braun to revoke this promise, to not allow Indiana prisons to be used to detain people who are not criminals, and to honor our tradition of federalism by refusing to comply with the federal authorities carrying out these heinous acts, while we call on the federal government to offer a bridge, not an alligator-infested moat, to those seeking a better life in the great melting pot of the United States.

(Photo courtesy of Washington State School for the Blind)The longtime superintendent at the Washington State School for the Blind is resigning amid threats from a disgruntled former employee, he announced this month. 
“Change can bring fresh energy and perspective, and I am hopeful the agency will continue to grow and thrive in the years ahead,” Scott McCallum wrote in his resignation letter. “I have decided it is best for me and for the WSSB that I resign from my role as superintendent to seek new leadership opportunities.”
McCallum has been the Vancouver school’s superintendent since 2016. Gov. Bob Ferguson reappointed McCallum upon taking office in January.
In his resignation letter to Ferguson, McCallum attributed his departure, effective Aug. 15, partially to “continuous harassment from a former employee that has created significant disruption across the agency.”
“I remain hopeful that such disruption and threats may cease once I depart my role as superintendent,” he wrote to the governor Aug. 1. “Also, with the recent shift to your administration and our school year ending, I believe this is the appropriate time for WSSB to begin a new chapter under new leadership.”

In a court filing in May related to the alleged harassment, McCallum said he worried the former employee would escalate threats and commit violence. He was especially worried since many of the staff at the school are blind or visually impaired. 
“Her continual focus on us and violence, and our particular vulnerabilities has us all worried and scared,” he wrote. “I regularly drive new routes to work. I park in different places at work regularly, always backed in to make for a quick escape. I can’t leave my house without looking out to see if she is outside and I have found new routes to walk my dogs.”
McCallum didn’t respond to requests for further comment last week.
Ferguson tapped Pam Parker, the school’s outreach director, to serve as interim superintendent for the 2025-26 school year.
The school serves blind, visually-impaired and deaf-blind students. Fifty students were enrolled this past school year, according to state data. It has about 100 full-time equivalent employees and a state budget of around $29 million.
McCallum has a national reputation in education of students who are blind or visually impaired. He helped implement the country’s first online adaptive state assessment that is accessible to students who read Braille.
In 2022, the National Federation of the Blind awarded McCallum with the Distinguished Educator of Blind Students award. 
Before coming to Washington, McCallum worked in education in Oregon.

WATERLOO, Iowa — John-Paul Sager appreciates the care he has received at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics, but he thinks it should be easier for veterans like him to use their benefits elsewhere.
Sager, a Marine Corps and Army veteran, uses his VA coverage for non-VA treatment of back injuries stemming from his military service. But he said he sometimes must make several phone calls to obtain approval to see a local chiropractor. “It seems like it takes entirely too long,” he said.
Many veterans live hours from VA facilities, or they need health services that aren’t readily available from the VA. In such cases, the department is supposed to provide a referral and pay for private care. Critics say it often hesitates to do so.
Republicans controlling Congress aim to streamline the process of obtaining what is known as community care.
Two Republican senators have introduced legislation that would make it easier for rural veterans to seek care at local hospitals and clinics. The proposals would build on VA community care programs that started under Democratic President Barack Obama and were expanded in Trump’s first term.
Critics worry that steering veterans to private care facilities drains federal money from the VA hospital and clinic system. But supporters say veterans shouldn’t be forced to travel long distances or wait months for the treatment they could obtain at local hospitals and clinics.
“My main concern is for veterans, not for the VA,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told KFF Health News. “I don’t believe we have an obligation to sustain the bureaucracy.”
About 9 million veterans are enrolled in the VA health system. Last year, about 3 million of them — including 1.2 million rural veterans — used their benefits to cover care at non-VA facilities, according to data provided by the department.
Cramer sponsored a bill that would allow veterans who live within 35 miles of a rural, “critical access” hospital to use VA benefits to cover care there or at affiliated clinics without referrals from VA staff.
Cramer, who serves on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, noted his state has just one VA hospital. It’s in Fargo, on the state’s eastern border, which is more than 400 miles by car from parts of western North Dakota.
Many North Dakota veterans drive past multiple community hospitals to get to the VA hospital for treatment, he said. Meanwhile, many rural hospitals are desperate for more patients and income. “I kept thinking to myself, ‘This doesn’t make any sense at all,’” Cramer said.
Cramer said previous laws, including the VA Mission Act, made it easier for veterans to use their benefits to cover care at community hospitals and clinics.
But he said veterans still must fill out too much paperwork and obtain approval from VA staffers to use non-VA facilities.
“We can’t let the VA itself determine whether a veteran is qualified to receive local care,” he said.
U.S. Rep. Mark Takano of California, who is the top Democrat on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said he sees the need for outside care for some veterans. But he contends Republicans are going overboard in shifting the department’s money to support private health care facilities.
The VA provides specialized care that responds to veterans’ needs and experiences, he argues.
“We must prevent funds from being siphoned away from veterans’ hospitals and clinics, or VA will crumble,” Takano said in a statement released by his office. “Veterans cannot afford for us to dismantle VA direct care in favor of shifting more care to the community.”
Some veterans’ advocacy groups have also expressed concerns.
Jon Retzer, deputy national legislative director for the Disabled American Veterans, said the group wants to make it easier for veterans to find care. Rural and female veterans can have a particularly tough time finding appropriate, timely services at VA hospitals and clinics, he said. But the Disabled American Veterans doesn’t want to see VA facilities weakened by having too much federal money diverted to private hospitals and clinics.
Retzer said it’s true that patients sometimes wait for VA care, but so do patients at many private hospitals and clinics. Most delays stem from staff shortages, he said, which afflict many health facilities. “This is a national crisis.”
Retzer said the Disabled American Veterans favors continuing to require referrals from VA physicians before veterans can seek VA-financed care elsewhere. “We want to ensure that the VA is the primary provider of that care,” he said.
Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins has pledged to improve the community care program while maintaining the strength of the department’s hospitals and clinics. The department declined a KFF Health News request to interview Collins.
Marcus Lewis, CEO of First Care Health Center, which includes a hospital in Park River, North Dakota, supports Cramer’s bill. Lewis is a Navy veteran who uses the VA’s community care option to pay for treatment of a back injury stemming from his military service.
Overall, Lewis said, the community care program has become easier to use. But the application process remains complicated, and participants must repeatedly obtain VA referrals for treatment of chronic issues, he said. “It’s frustrating.”
Park River is a 1,400-person town about 50 miles south of the Canadian border. Its 14-bed hospital offers an array of services, including surgery, cancer care, and mental health treatment. But Lewis regularly sees a VA van picking up local veterans, some of whom travel 140 miles to Fargo for care they’re entitled to receive locally.
“I think a lot of folks just don’t want to fight the system,” he said. “They don’t want to go through the extra hoops, and so they’ll jump in the van, and they’ll ride along.”
Rep. Mike Bost (R-Ill.), chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said veterans in some areas of the country have had more trouble than others in getting VA approval for care from private clinics and hospitals.
Bost helped gain the House’s approval for Trump’s request for $34.7 billion for the community care program in 2026. Although spending on the program has gone up and down in recent years, the appropriation represents an increase of about 50% from what it was in 2025 and 2022. The Senate included similar figures for next year in its version of a military spending budget that passed Aug. 1.
Bost also co-sponsored a House bill that would spell out requirements for the VA to pay for community care.
Sager hopes the new proposals make life easier for veterans. The Gulf War veteran lives in the northeastern Iowa town of Denver. He travels about 15 miles to Waterloo to see a chiropractor, who treats him for back and shoulder pain from injuries he suffered while training Saudi troops in hand-to-hand combat.
Sager, who remains active in the Army Reserve, also visits a Waterloo outpatient clinic run by the VA, where his primary care doctor practices. He appreciates the agency’s mission, including its employment of many veterans. “You just feel like you’re being taken care of by your own,” he said.
He believes the VA can run a strong hospital and clinic system while offering alternatives for veterans who live far from those facilities or who need care the VA can’t promptly provide.
The local VA doesn’t offer chiropractic care, so it pays for Sager to visit the private clinic. But every few months, he needs to obtain fresh approval from the VA. That often requires several phone calls, he said.
Sager is one of about a dozen veterans who use the community care program to pay for visits at Vanderloo Chiropractic Clinic, office manager Linda Gill said.
Gill said the VA program pays about $34 for a typical visit, which is comparable to private insurance, but the paperwork is more burdensome. She said leaders of the chiropractic practice considered pulling out of the VA program but decided to put up with the hassles for a good cause. She wishes veterans didn’t have to jump through so many hoops to obtain convenient care.
“After what they’ve done for us? Please,” she said.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Neighborhoods across Milwaukee County are continuing to recover from record-shattering flooding over the weekend. Inundated basements, entire portions of Wauwatosa seemingly underwater, people fleeing the Wisconsin State Fair which shut down early amid rising floodwater and reports of cars literally floating away down roadways all followed the torrential downpour which began Aug. 9. 
The National Weather Service recorded 5.74 inches of rain Saturday, eclipsing the  previous single-day record for Milwaukee of 1.64 inches of rain. Meteorologists say that Saturday was Milwaukee’s second wettest day in 154 years of record keeping. Additional rainfall brought the total up to nearly 7 inches, with some areas expected to get over 10 inches of rain. Researchers have long-warned that increased and more intense rain and flooding would be among the ways climate change would manifest in Wisconsin.

Casey Serrano, a resident of Milwaukee’s North Side left the home she shares with her boyfriend around 8 p.m. Saturday about an hour after the rain started. When she returned around 1 a.m., she saw water in the basement “coming out of our main sewer drain that was covering maybe a quarter to a third of our basement, maybe an inch deep.” During the night, the water rose to nearly 2 feet of “brown runoff from the street,” she said.
Serrano woke up to find there was no  power in her home. “Our immediate street is not flooded, and did not flood last night,” she told Wisconsin Examiner. “But the streets surrounding us flooded pretty heavily.” When she went out on  Silver Spring Drive to get supplies, she saw “within like a 20-block radius of our house there were cars that had clearly floated down Silver Spring.”  
“Thousands in Milwaukee are facing flooding after last night’s storms,” Mayor Cavalier Johnson wrote on X. “Avoid flooded roads — moving water is dangerous. City crews and first responders are working nonstop. Neighbors are stepping up to help neighbors.” The mayor posted that the city was coordinating with Gov. Tony Evers and Milwaukee County on emergency aid and shelters. “Milwaukee is strong,” Mayor Johnson posted. “Together, we’ll get through this.” 
Across Milwaukee County, emergency responders were overwhelmed as the flooding created a cascade of issues with natural gas, debris and power outages. “Very busy night for [Milwaukee Fire Department] & many other FD’s!”, Milwaukee Fire Department Chief Aaron Lipski posted on X. “Over 600 responses between 8pm-7am: numerous fires, water rescues, & many other weather-related emergencies.” 
 


Video shared with Wisconsin Examiner by Casey Serrano, a City of Milwaukee resident who experienced severe basement flooding after the storms on August 9th and 10th, 2025.
 
Online videos showed  cars trapped on flooded roadways and highways. People attending one of the final days of the Wisconsin State Fair were filmed wading through water to leave the fairgrounds. Around 10 p.m. on Sunday the sky began to light up with a new wave of lightning, heralding more rain. Over 18,000 people reportedly lost power during the storms.

“Flooding is still an active emergency situation across Milwaukee County, and we are expecting more rain today and into this evening,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a press statement Sunday. “I strongly urge our residents to stay cautious, stay informed, and refrain from traveling. Check  in on your neighbors and loved ones, especially older adults, and seek out emergency assistance if needed. I am thankful for our first responders, law enforcement partners, social services workers, and neighbors who are lending a helping hand during a challenging time. We will get through this together, Milwaukee.”
Local officials are warning residents not to walk into floodwater, as it may be contaminated or be near downed electrical wires. In some areas, the water had strong currents capable of sweeping people away. Those cleaning up debris are encouraged to wear gloves and proper protection, and residents are encouraged to limit water usage (such as by holding off on washing dishes or doing laundry) to reduce the risk of wastewater backing up into basements. 
The suburban city of Wauwatosa produced some of the most dramatic images of flooding throughout the county. According to the Wauwatosa Police Department (WPD), over 500 calls were received by their dispatch center with issues ranging from flooded out basements to blocked storm drains to traffic incidents due to standing water. WPD says there have been no reports of serious injuries, though several major roadways and intersections remain affected and impassable. 
Hart Park, near the Wauwatosa Village, is closed, and police are encouraging people to avoid the area. Sunday afternoon, many people were seen walking through the village area and parts of Hart Park to observe storm damage. Large debris was strewn along the railroad tracks, and reports indicate that the Menomonee River flowing through Hart Park rose from a little over 1 foot high to over 14 feet in a matter of hours. Sunday afternoon the water level was still high, with rushing water ripping through the park continuing to damage green spaces and concrete bike paths. Wauwatosa squad cars used loudspeakers to declare the area closed due to a state of emergency.

Traffic control issues were also reported by the Waukesha Police Department, with the Fox River also under close observation. Waukesha Sheriff’s Department spokesperson Capt. Nicholas Wenzel said in an email statement that the department was “dealing with flooding across the county,” and that no injuries or missing persons had been reported.
For Serrano, the flood is an unprecedented experience. She anticipates costly repairs, including ripping out wood paneling in her house. 
Serrano is also concerned about what the flooding means for the city. “I think that my main concern is that the city is completely unprepared to deal with this, and I think it’s really willful on their part to be honest,” she said. Serrano, who used to work  for the city’s sewage department creating and analyzing data maps, thinks city budget and staffing cuts have adversely affected emergency preparedness. She blames Act 10, which has limited public employees’ collective bargaining rights since 2011, arguing that it  has contributed to staffing shortages and out-dated technology for city departments most responsible for preventing floods, and dealing with their aftermath. 
 










 
Act 12, which mandates that staffing and funding are maintained for the Milwaukee Police Department, also exacerbated the imbalance between police and  other departments including  Public Works, she said. 
“At any point, the Common Council could stand up for residents of this city — especially residents of the North Side,” Serrano said,  “and say we’re not going to deal with this anymore. We are going to fully fund these departments so that they have the right materials and the right resources to fully staff themselves, to fully hire.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2975-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 06:58:12.367055

Phil Murphy of pushing ""dangerous sanctuary city policies"" after an undocumented immigrant was arrested and charged with a fatal car crash that killed a Lakewood mom and her daughter. (Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Dana DiFilippo)State prosecutors sought pretrial detention last month for an undocumented immigrant accused of killing a woman and her daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood, but a Superior Court judge denied the state’s request.
The fatal crash has sparked a new fight between the Trump and Murphy administrations, with the White House accusing Gov. Phil Murphy of pushing “dangerous sanctuary city policies.” President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. attorney of New Jersey has previously said she’s investigating Murphy, a Democrat, and Attorney General Matt Platkin over a state directive that limits when local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.
A Murphy spokesman said the governor believes the man at the center of this fight — Raul Luna-Perez, whom federal authorities said entered the United States illegally from Mexico — should have been deported long ago, and one for Platkin stressed that the state’s directive allows for cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding anyone charged with a violent crime or convicted of any indictable offense.
Platkin has noted that prosecutors wanted Luna-Perez to remain behind bars after the July 26 fatal crash, which killed Maria Pleitez, 42, and her 11-year-old daughter, Dayanara. At a July 31 court hearing in Ocean County, Gregory Lenzi, assistant county prosecutor, said he was “shocked and appalled” that Luna-Perez was arrested three times in four months for driving under the influence, according to a recording of the hearing obtained by the New Jersey Monitor.
“The defendant was fortunate, following his first DWI, no one was severely injured or killed. He then made the conscious decision to drive intoxicated a second time, 27 days later,” Lenzi said. “Now, your honor, following this third incident, we are here because two people are dead and another is injured.”
A public safety assessment that weighs risk factors to determine whether a defendant should be detained before trial indicated Luna-Perez should be released, Luna-Perez’s defense attorney said. But Lenzi urged Superior Court Judge Wendel E. Daniels to keep Luna-Perez jailed anyway.
“The defendant is clearly an obstruction risk, as he repeatedly operates a motor vehicle in a manner which poses a risk of death and serious bodily injury to every member of the community on the roads, either in a car or on foot,” he said.
Daniels sided with Luna-Perez’s lawyer. He ordered Luna-Perez released but confined to his Red Bank home with an ankle monitor, barred him from operating a vehicle, and ordered a substance abuse evaluation.
“As the state argued, his conduct was conscious and deliberate, getting behind the wheel allegedly under the influence. That resulted in a tragedy and also presented a danger to the community as well,” Daniels said. “However, his attorney argued, and rightfully so, this defendant has no other pending charges, no disorderly persons convictions, no indictable convictions, no violent convictions.”
Luna-Perez’s release turned out to be temporary. Immigration agents later arrested him, and on Thursday, Ocean County authorities said they retrieved him from a migrant jail in Elizabeth and brought him back to an Ocean County jail as they seek a second time to keep him behind bars.
“His return sends a clear message that our federal partners share in our mission to hold those individuals that commit serious crimes accountable — regardless of their immigration status,” Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said in a statement.
Ocean County has resisted the state directive, known as the Immigration Trust Directive. In 2019 it sued the state to invalidate the order, saying it was preempted by federal law. A federal judge ruled against the county, a decision that was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2021.
 Charges

Luna-Perez was initially charged with two counts each of vehicular homicide and assault by auto. Authorities say he was speeding and driving drunk, crossed double-yellow lines into oncoming traffic, and collided head-on with a car driven by Pleitez. Luna-Perez’s blood alcohol level was about three times the legal limit at the time of the crash, authorities say.
After Luna-Perez was released by the judge in Ocean County, county prosecutors slapped him with two counts each of aggravated manslaughter and strict liability vehicular homicide.
Luna-Perez has several prior arrests but no convictions, court records show. He was arrested on March 20 and April 17 by Red Bank police and charged with driving under the influence. He was accused of domestic violence in a June 2023 complaint that was later withdrawn, so the matter was dismissed, state courts spokeswoman MaryAnn Spoto said.
White House spokesman Abigail Jackson said the blame for the crash “rests squarely with Governor Murphy.”
“This criminal illegal alien had three prior arrests by local police — including two that were for driving under the influence. The innocent people he killed should still be alive today — and they would be if it weren’t for sanctuary policies that protect criminal illegal aliens. President Trump is committed to carrying out the largest mass deportation operation of criminal illegal aliens in history and Making America Safe Again,” Jackson said.
The Immigrant Trust Directive, first issued in 2018, restricts when local and state law enforcement can help federal immigration authorities and bars them from asking about immigration status during certain encounters. But the directive says when it comes to certain violent and serious offenses, including assault, cops are allowed to cooperate with immigration agents.
“To be clear, nothing in the Immigrant Trust Directive would have prevented New Jersey law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials to deport this defendant. And we reiterate that the Immigrant Trust Directive allows for cooperation with ICE in regard to anyone charged with a violent crime or convicted of any indictable offense,” said Platkin spokeswoman Sharon Lauchaire.
Mahen Gunaratna, a Murphy spokesman, said Luna-Perez should have faced repercussions for his previous charges.
“The Governor believes that Mr. Luna-Perez, who has been arrested multiple times for DUI and domestic violence, should not have been allowed behind the wheel and should have already been deported due to his previous dangerous criminal activity,” Gunaratna said.
Prosecutors at the July 31 hearing discussed details from Luna-Perez’s two previous DWI arrests.
On March 20, police accused him of hitting another car that was attempting to park. He failed roadside sobriety tests and had a blood alcohol content of 0.186, more than twice the legal limit of 0.08, police said.
On April 17, police said he nearly hit a marked Red Bank police car head-on. Officers found multiple Modelo cans in his car, and he attempted to get rid of an open can by spilling it all over the inside of his truck, police said. His blood alcohol content then was 0.16, they said.
“His actions have been egregious, and with three documented incidents, has given this court zero reason to believe he will abide by any condition of release,” Lenzi said during last week’s hearing. “Your honor has the authority to … not give this defendant a fourth opportunity to do this again.”
Luna-Perez’s immigration status was not discussed at that hearing.

(Photo courtesy of Howard Rynearson) After years of failing to advance legislation to eliminate Idaho’s sales tax on groceries, an effort has launched to make the change via voter ballot initiative. 
Howard Rynearson, Payette County GOP Central Committee chairman, is leading the charge to gather enough signatures to place the measure on the November 2026 ballot.  
“People are very, very disgusted and tired of the fact that we’ve not been able to do this,” Rynearson told the Idaho Capital Sun in a phone interview. 
If passed, the “Repeal Idaho’s Grocery Tax” initiative would in fiscal year 2028 eliminate Idaho’s 6% sales tax on food items, as defined by the federal Supplemental Nutrition and Assistant Program, or SNAP. The sales tax would remain for alcohol, tobacco, and restaurant sales of food or “hot food products ready for immediate consumption.”  
The initiative would also eliminate the Idaho Grocery Tax Credit, which is meant to offset the sales tax on food spent throughout the year. 
Rynearson said the elimination of the tax is “the most achievable tax repeal that we can do right now.” 
He said that although the Idaho Republican Party is strongly behind the move, he is pursuing the initiative proposal as an individual. 
 Idaho lawmakers have failed to advance bills to repeal the sales tax on food 

In 2017, the Idaho Legislature passed a bill eliminating the sales tax on food, known colloquially as the “grocery tax,”  but then-Gov. Butch Otter vetoed the bill, saying the costs were “too high,” the Idaho Statesman reported at the time.   
Since then, other efforts have been discussed or attempted but none advanced. Many of the proposals have come in the form of “personal bills,” which go around the committee process and are typically stored with the clerk and do not advance. Rynearson said committee chairs and leaders have refused to hear proposed bills in hearings. 
During this year’s legislative session, the Legislature passed and Gov. Brad Little signed a law increasing the grocery tax credit from $120 a year per person to $155 per person per year. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs bill to increase grocery tax credit

During Senate debate on the bill, Sen. Christy Zito, R-Mountain Home, attempted to send the bill to what’s known as the 14th order, in which senators may propose amendments, for the purpose of changing the bill to eliminate the grocery tax, the Sun reported. Her procedural move failed in a 5-28 vote. 
Amid calls to instead eliminate the sales tax on food and the tax credit entirely, bill sponsor and House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, said that keeping the grocery credit allowed the state to continue collecting revenue on groceries bought by out-of-state visitors, the Sun reported. 
Rynearson countered this logic. 
“The tourism situation is way overstated,” he said. “Most people that travel through the state are tourists going from one state to the other, they generally eat at restaurants or fast food businesses. Those are exempted from this repeal.” 
Idaho is one of 13 states that applies sales tax to food, according to the Coeur d’Alene-based conservative think tank Mountain States Policy Center. The policy center commissioned a poll in 2024 that found 87% of respondents were in favor of eliminating the sales tax on groceries.

 Ballot initiative would decrease state revenue 

The state does not track how much of its sales tax revenue is generated from grocery purchases. To create the required fiscal impact statement for the proposed initiative, the Division of Financial Management used information from Utah, which does track this information. 
Utah’s data showed that groceries typically comprised 11% to 13% of retail sales, according to the impact statement. The division projected sales tax revenue of $3.7 billion, and estimated a loss of revenue of $410 million to $485 million total. 
However, because the initiative would also eliminate the grocery tax credit, which costs the state between $210 million and $255 million, the net revenue loss would be $200 million and $230 million, according to the impact statement. 
In 2024, the state collected nearly $3.1 billion in total sales tax revenue, according to the Idaho State Tax Commission annual report. The Legislature this year also passed historic cuts to income and property taxes, reducing revenues by an estimated more than $400 million annually. These tax cuts and other legislation passed the past two years draw down sales tax revenue, which was a driving factor in the state reporting revenue coming in $141.5 million below projections near the end of fiscal year 2025, the Sun reported. 
Rynearson expressed doubts that the sales tax revenue would increase in the next two years as much as projected in the impact statement, but said he opted not to challenge the statement. 
 Initiative backed by Idaho GOP 

Rynearson said he did not think the issue was political and that any registered voter could be involved or interested in making the change, but leaders of the Idaho Republican Party are supporting the effort. 
Idaho GOP Chairwoman Dorothy Moon this week wrote in an opinion piece that “it’s time to end the grocery tax.” 
“If the Legislature won’t act, it’s time for the people of Idaho to get it done,” Moon wrote. 
Members of the party voted this summer in favor of a resolution, sponsored by Rynearson, to support an initiative repealing the sales tax on groceries. 
Many in the party have also expressed support for limiting the ballot initiative process. 
During the party’s 2025 winter meeting, Rynearson also brought forward a resolution that was approved to increase the threshold for the signatures needed to get an initiative on the ballot. 
The resolution states that because the process “bypasses the Legislature,” it should increase the threshold from 6% of registered voters in at least 18 of Idaho’s 35 legislative districts to at least 10% of registered voters in 23 of 35 districts. 
Rynearson said at the time of that meeting, he “wasn’t that impressed with the initiative” process. 
“I thought we were such a red state, we didn’t need it, but then came the option that we really needed it,” he said.  
Moon in her newsletter addressed some of the criticism of the initiative process. 
“I know what you might be thinking: ‘Aren’t ballot initiatives tools of the left?’” Moon wrote. “Sometimes, yes. But there’s an important difference here. This initiative is bottom-up and driven entirely by the grassroots.” 
Initiative supporters will need to gather more than 70,000 signatures, including at least 6% of registered voters in 18 of 35 legislative districts. Rynearson said he and supporters are visiting state fairs and encouraging small business owners to put petitions in their lobbies. 
There is information about the petition, including how to share it, at repealidahogrocerytax.org.

Hooker, the HVAC manager of Lloyd’s Plumbing and Heating Corp. in nearby Janesville, was standing inside a hangar-sized classroom in the school’s advanced manufacturing academy, where students construct full-size rooms, hang drywall and learn the basics of masonry. His company sends him to the school twice a week for about two months a year to help teach general heating, venting and air conditioning concepts to students. 
“I cover the mountaintop stuff,” he said, noting that at a minimum students will understand HVAC when they become homeowners.
But the bigger potential payoff is that these students could wind up working alongside Hooker after they graduate. If his firm has an opening, any student recommended by teacher Mike Wagner would be a “done deal,” Hooker said. “Plus, if they come through this class, I know them.” 
Manufacturing and construction dominate the business needs inside Beloit, a small city of 36,000 just minutes from the Illinois border. Sitting at the nexus of two major highways, and within 100 miles of Chicago, Milwaukee and Madison, Beloit is home to a range of businesses that include a Frito-Lay production plant, an Amazon distribution center and a Navy subcontractor. In the next two years, a $500 million casino and hotel complex is scheduled to open. 
But staffing these companies into the future is a major concern. Across the country, the average age of manufacturing workers is increasing, and one in four of these workers is age 55 or older, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2021 figures, the most recent available. In many other jobs the workforce is aging, too. Wisconsin is one of several states looking to boost career and technical education, or CTE, as a possible solution to the aging and shrinking workforce. 
While the unemployment rate of Rock County, which includes Beloit, is 3.6 percent, only slightly higher than the state’s 3.2 percent, there’s a worker mismatch in the city, according to Drew Pennington, its economic development director.
Every day, 14,000 city residents travel outside of Beloit to work, while the same number commute into the city to fill mostly higher-paying jobs, said Pennington. 
So when Beloit decided to revamp its public high school in 2018, CTE and work-based learning were at the forefront of the transformation. 
The 1,225-student school now has three academies that cover 13 different career paths. After ninth grade, students choose to concentrate in an area, which means taking several courses in a specific field. Students also have the option to do work-based learning, which can mean internships, a youth apprenticeship or working at high-end simulated job sites inside the school. 
“This creates not just a pipeline to jobs but also to career choices,” said Jeff Stenroos, the district’s director of CTE and alternative education.

“There are a lot of really good-paying jobs in this area. Students don’t need to leave, or go earn a four-year degree,” Stenroos said. An auto mechanic can “earn six figures by the age of 26 and that’s more than an educator with a master’s degree,” he said.
Beloit’s effort is a shift in high school emphasis similar to the extensive CTE programs being run in other places, notably Indiana, Kentucky and Alabama. In 2024, 40 states enacted 152 CTE-related policies, the biggest push in five years, according to Advance CTE, a nonprofit group that represents state CTE officials. Nationwide, about 20 percent of high school students take a concentration of CTE courses, it says, adding that the high school graduation rate for students who concentrate in CTE is 90 percent, 15 percentage points higher than the national average. 
Three years ago, Wisconsin called for 7 percent of its high school students to be in workplace learning programs by 2026. Beloit’s progress puts it far ahead of that target. In Beloit Memorial, nearly 1 in 3 students meet this designation today, Stenroos said. 
The high school features a cavernous construction area where students build full-scale rooms, learn masonry and complete plumbing and electrical wiring projects. The metal shop offers 16 welding stations and a die-cutter machine that allows students to create customized pieces to fit projects. Down the street, the school runs an eight-bay car repair center, a space it took over when a Sears autobody shop left town.
These spaces are “better than a lot of technical colleges,” Stenroos said.
In addition to their high school courses, Beloit Memorial students pile up industry-recognized certifications, Stenroos said. More than 40 percent of its students graduate with at least one certification, and 1 in 4 of them has multiple certifications. 
While some simple certifications, such as OSHA Workplace Safety, can be accomplished in just 10 hours, others, such as those for the American Welding Society, require up to 500 hours of student work, he added. The state has called for 9 percent of graduating high school students to have earned at least one certification by next year. To incentivize schools to offer these opportunities, the state’s Department of Workforce Development pays schools for each student who earns a certification; in 2024, Beloit received $85,000 through this program, Stenroos said.
One of the school’s best automotive students, Geiry Lopez, graduated this year with five Automotive Service Excellence certifications. Standing less than 5 feet tall, Lopez said she is not bothered that she might not look like a typical mechanic. “I know I can do this,” she said, adding that she hopes to work on heavy machinery such as tractor trailers after she graduates.
She’s worked on her own car, with some fellow students, replacing the brakes, a front axle, rotors and wheel bearings at the school’s garage, she said, although she still hasn’t been able to drive it.
“My dad is taking forever to teach me how to drive,” she said.

The garage operates like an actual business, but the only customers are teachers and other Beloit staffers and students. Students estimate work costs, order parts and communicate with customers before any repairs take place. While oil changes and brake replacements are common, some students are totally rebuilding an engine in one car. 
Over in the welding room, rising senior Cole Mellom was putting the finishing touches on a smoker he built in less than a month’s time. He said he loved the creativity of finding a plan, cutting the metal and building something that he could sell, all while in school. Plus, he knows that welding is a key skill needed for his dream job, race-car fabrication.
In the past, students created a custom-made protective plate that the city’s police use on a bomb squad vehicle.
The welding program has 125 students this year and had to turn away 65 more because of space limitations, Stenroos said; last year, 17 of the school’s welding academy graduates enlisted in the armed forces to specialize in welding. 
These programs are designed to help meet the future needs of the state’s workforce. More than one-third of Wisconsin jobs will require education beyond high school but less than a bachelor’s degree by 2031, according to the Association for Career and Technical Education. For the last four years, the state has had more job openings than people on unemployment.
“There’s more jobs than there are people to fill them right now,” said Deb Prowse, a former career academy coach at Beloit Memorial who now works at Craftsman with Character, an area nonprofit that helps train students for careers in skilled trades.

Hooker, the Lloyd’s Plumbing HVAC manager, agreed. “Every project we work on has a delay, from a multimillion-dollar mansion to a three-bedroom spec,” he said. “There aren’t enough workers.”
The main reason Beloit Memorial has been able to zoom past state and national goals for both CTE and work-based learning is the school’s single-minded focus since 2018 on helping to ensure that its graduates will understand what businesses need and giving them a head start toward gaining those skills.
High school officials actually pared back the program from 44 pathways to 13, Stenroos said, part of an effort to tie each pathway to specific jobs. About 75 percent of pathways target area jobs, with the remaining quarter highlighting prominent professions within the state, he added. 
Even though three straight budget referendum defeats have left the district with a $6.2 million funding gap, Stenroos said he’s been able to keep the CTE equipment modernized through donations and strategic allocation of the school’s federal Perkins grant and the state reimbursement for student certifications. In one instance, the school recently bought a $20,000 scanner for its automotive program; the machine can not only help diagnose a car problem, but also connect students to garages throughout the country that have successfully fixed the specified problem. 
“It’s an expensive piece of equipment,” Stenroos said, “but it’s industry-certified and will give students real-life experience.”
Each of the three academies has an advisory board of teachers and industry professionals who work out how to embed practical lessons in classroom curriculum. “We ask business people, ‘What do you need, and how can we help our kids get there?’ ” said Stenroos.
“It’s really cool how receptive the school is to feedback,” said Heather Dobson, the business development manager at Corporate Contractors, Inc., a 200-person general contracting firm.
She explained that the district has incorporated small changes over the years, such as having students work in Microsoft programs instead of Google Classroom apps and teaching them how to write a professional email.
“Rarely is there an idea presented that they don’t embrace,” said Celestino Ruffini, the CEO of Visit Beloit, a nonprofit that promotes tourism of the city. The school is expanding its hospitality program because of the expected influx of jobs connected to the new casino and hotel, he said. 
All the changes aren’t at the high school, however. In order to employ Beloit Memorial students, Frito-Lay had to alter its corporate policy of not allowing anyone under 18 to work in its plants, according to Angela Slagle, a supply chain manager there. The company now hires Beloit Memorial students for its career exploration youth apprenticeship program, she added. 
The connection to area businesses goes beyond the school’s leaders. Each year, about 10 teachers complete an externship in which they spend one week of their summer at a local business. Teachers are paid $1,000 for the 20 hours, and they not only learn about what jobs a company may have but also find ways to incorporate real-world problems into their classroom lessons.
A few summers back, math teacher Michelle Kelly spent a week at Corporate Contractors. She was searching for different ways to use construction-based math problems with her students. In addition to using math to estimate a bid for a project or calculate the surface area of a job, she realized that complex math is needed to build a truss, the framework used to support a roof or bridge.
Because the triangular truss is supported by different lengths of wood inside its structure, Kelly said, building one requires the calculation of angles, total area, how much wood is needed and more. Since all her algebra students were in the school’s construction academy, she partnered with those teachers to go beyond blueprints and have the 10th graders build trusses, a collection of which sit in the back of her classroom.
She sees this work as one way to help counter the chronic absenteeism that has existed since Covid. Teaching with this kind of hands-on work makes students see the relevance of algebra, she said. “Would it be easier to just have them take a test? Yes.” 
Beloit Memorial Principal Emily Pelz said the school’s work is paying off. In the last four years, the school’s four-year graduation rate has ticked up slightly, from 83.4 percent in 2021-22 to 85.2 percent in 2024-25, while its attendance went from 78.5 percent to 84.8 percent in the same period, Pelz said. 
Rik Thomas, a rising senior who already has his own business repairing and modifying cars, said this work has definitely made him more interested in school. While he thought the academy would merely explain what a construction career might include, “It’s nice to find out how to do the work.” His father works in construction and, Thomas added, “He loves that I take this program.” 
Thomas and his classmates built a wooden shed earlier this year and were able to sell it for $2,500, with the money going to pay for more materials. Likewise, the first smoker created in the welding class was bought by Stenroos; the students are looking forward to posting the second one for sale after they determine how much they should charge. 
While the school’s construction and other trade-related fields have drawn the most attention, its three academies also offer career paths in healthcare, education, business, the arts, hospitality and more. 
For example, rising senior Tayvon Cates said he hopes to study pre-med at a historically Black college or university on his way to becoming a cardiology radiologist. Cates, who is in the school’s health and education academy, said, “If you want to do something, the school can help you do it.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch.Iowa State University is charging up to become a destination for academics and industry dealing in battery fabrication and testing, with new equipment opening doors for expanded study of the power source.
Todd Kingston, an ISU researcher and assistant professor of mechanical engineering, said the accelerating rate calorimeter system now housed at the university and used for battery testing will hopefully draw in interested students. It would act as a centerpiece of a “shared facility,” where ISU researchers and collaborators can create prototypes and test these and other batteries.
“Various users across campus will have the ability to come in and use that, but we’re hoping to even extend that to partners outside of the university, ones that maybe necessarily don’t have the capabilities or the equipment, or perhaps also the expertise to do some sort of the testing that they want,” Kingston said. “So we can perhaps even work with them to do that testing, provide that expertise, that training … and those resources to them.”

The new equipment was purchased for the university through grant funding from the U.S. Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research, which Kingston secured. It took several months to install and integrate into lab infrastructure, he said, but the machinery has been up and running for some time.
Both new and used battery cells can be tested with the equipment, Kingston said, allowing researchers to see how they respond under various conditions at different stages of wear. The conditions placed upon the cells can range from electrical to thermal to mechanical, with data being taken on temperature, pressure, voltage, self-heating levels and more in real time.
Batteries are sometimes pushed past their limits as part of testing, Kingston said, leading to their damage or even full destruction. As the batteries are encased in the equipment, researchers can stand just a few feet away and monitor the tests through a computer system.
Qusai Alahmad, a third-year Ph.D. student studying mechanical engineering at ISU, called the new ARC equipment an “amazing tool” — one he’s been able to use already as part of a project funded by the Office of Naval Research.
In addition to funding the purchase of the equipment, Kingston said the Office of Naval Research has provided grant dollars to multiple projects that utilize the ARC system and look at metrics associated with batteries and what characteristics can influence their level of safety.
One of these projects has ISU researchers testing effects of thermal gradients on battery safety, and another has the university running battery tests to verify predictive modeling for “thermal runaway,” or when a battery goes beyond its limits, developed at the University of Arizona.

Battery safety is a topic that is growing in popularity and importance, Alahmad said, as lithium-ion batteries can be found everywhere, from phones to cars to satellites.
“Looking into it is very important, right, not only for the environment, but for the safety of people using these batteries,” Alahmad said. “Since it’s part of my funding, it’s really exciting.”
There are only a handful of ARC systems currently operating across the U.S., Kingston said, and even fewer are housed in university labs. This allows ISU to conduct research and testing that cannot be done elsewhere due to safety hazards.
Joined by other ISU researchers and utilizing internal funding from the Office of the President, Kingston said he is working to create a center where batteries can be crafted and tested on-site. Other equipment is still being installed for the center which will expand the kinds of batteries that can be fabricated.
Beyond academic study and potential partnerships with businesses and organizations, Kingston said the new equipment and center for battery testing will be helpful in workforce development, as ISU graduates will head into the world with experiences and skills they would have a hard time finding elsewhere.
More and more students, ranging from their undergraduate to graduate education, are becoming increasingly interested in battery technology, Kingston said, and he hopes the center and its toys will aid in recruitment and retention.
“It takes lots of different disciplines, knowledge, expertise to be able to tackle all the difficult problems associated with batteries,” Kingston said. “And so I hope that that attracts a lot of students from wide backgrounds to campus to come and learn and take advantage of the resources that we have.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Schools start up again this week for hundreds of thousands of Oklahoma students, and our public classrooms are in the throes of a massive teacher shortage.
Our children return from summer breaks suffering from some of the highest rates of adverse childhood experiences related to abuse, neglect and mental health struggles. Many of them are hungry. And they’re not excelling in school.
But the adults whose job is championing strategies to improve our kids’ futures are too busy bickering about their own adverse adult experience involving images of nude women shown on Superintendent Ryan Walters’ office television.
In their quest to defend their honor and tarnish someone else’s to prove they’re the wounded party in this debacle, they all seem to have forgotten who they’re supposed to be serving: our children.
Everybody that doesn’t live in a happy bubble knows that our school children today are dealing with worse things than a little shared nudity among adults. I suspect some children have probably dealt with worse in the month.
After all, they’re continually facing the threat of school shootings. Ours is a state that experiences high rates of domestic violence, high poverty rates, low health care outcomes, and high rates of childhood hunger. 
We’ve experienced a recent drop to 50th in the country in education quality. We rank 48th worst in per pupil spending, investing a pitiful $11,349 per student. Our teacher pay is 38th worst in the country, about $2,300 below the regional average. 
But instead of focusing on those struggles, we’re witnessing the bitter implosion of a seven-member governing board that is supposed to be working together to advocate for policies that chart a better path forward for our children. We’ve got a state superintendent and members of the board who have embarked on a bizarre crusade to prove they’re the true victims here.
Meanwhile, an initial probe released by Republican House Speaker Kyle Hilbert indicates that this brouhaha may boil down to adults being exposed to a little-remembered, R-rated Jackie Chan Hollywood flick that had scenes featuring fully nude women.
Hilbert said his findings seem “to vindicate” both Walters and the board members and these images weren’t shown intentionally.
If anything, Hilbert’s findings make this situation seem even more absurd.
Why was this board even watching TV in the first place during a closed-door meeting? They were supposed to be considering high-stakes matters that impact students, families, teacher licenses and schools. The television shouldn’t have been on, and the fact that it was makes me wonder if anyone is actually taking their responsibilities seriously.
But instead of taking responsibility for that blunder, two education board members last week decided the best course of action was to dump gasoline on this dumpster fire by firing off a statement that included “what we saw on TV is content that would get the certificate of any teacher in this state revoked had it showed up on a classroom TV.” 
Here we go again.
It’s not exactly shocking that a governing board that stripped one teacher’s license for providing high school students with a way to access an online library catalog that contains banned books would threaten the same punishment for another educator showing R-rated movies to people over 17. Is it any wonder that qualified teachers are fleeing to Texas or exiting the profession in droves?
I attended high school in a high-performing district in Texas. I occasionally viewed R-rated movies like “The Patriot,” and those teachers didn’t have their livelihoods threatened.
Maybe if Republican leadership stood up with the same gusto to Walters’ agenda that directly impacts students when it comes time to set academic standards or invest millions on Bible class in public schools we could take them seriously. 
It’s clear that the losers here are our public schools and the roughly 700,000 children that rely on them. 
It’s unfortunate that this debacle has distracted from that.
When Gov. Kevin Stitt ousted three State Board of Education members in February, he said he was sick of the panel driving up “needless political drama.” 
“If we want to be the best state for business, we need to make sure our kids have a path to success,” he said at the time. “It’s time for some fresh eyes and a renewed focus on our top ten goals.”
In a rare occurrence, I wholeheartedly agreed with the governor. I’d been looking forward to seeing what fresh ideas this board has to offer because what we’re doing isn’t moving the needle in the right direction.
Maybe the Board of Education needs to go back to school. Is this the best we can do?
I’m waiting for someone, anyone, to step up, show some leadership and remember what really matters here. 
Our children.

BENNINGTON — Tucked into a nondescript strip mall downtown, Bennington’s new methadone clinic has seen about 70 patients walk through its one-way glass doors since opening in late June.  
Inside, the building’s four hallways form a loop, offering patients a literal road to recovery. First-timers walk in to their right and visit with doctors in offices along the corridor one by one. They can get their first dose of methadone, a medicine prescribed for opioid use disorder, that day. 
It’s the first time that people who live in Bennington County have access to the medication in their own backyard, which opens up access and provides stability for people, health officials and recovery coaches said. 
With the clinic’s opening, Vermont now has a methadone clinic in each region of the state after building plans were complicated for years, said Kelly Dougherty, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Health. The Bennington clinic offers a glimpse of how methadone can help people in recovery.
In past years, it was a job on its own to get on meds for recovery, said Dylan Jonhson, a recovery coach at Turning Point in Bennington. 
One of Jonhson’s clients spent hours each day on the bus to a clinic in North Adams, Massachusetts. That trip would take up most of the client’s day, he said. And if they missed the bus, it could cause painful withdrawals and put their path to sobriety at risk. 
Now, that client goes to the local clinic in town, which has offered them much more stability. 
“They just got a job this week, and I guarantee you it’s because they didn’t have to go to North Adams,” Johnson said.

Many others also made the trek to North Adams regularly, said Sean Cossey, the clinic’s director. Now, Cossey’s trying to slowly funnel those people to the new clinic to make their lives easier. About 20% of the clinic’s clients so far have never received treatment before, he said. 
“The only thing I can’t do is make them walk in. But if they do walk in, they’ll be met with respect, they’ll be met as a person,” Cossey said. 
The clinic’s opening has been mostly celebrated by the community, Cossey said. About 50 people showed up for a July 23 ribbon cutting ceremony, he said. Then U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., and Rep. Paul Tonko, D-N.Y., came to tour the facility on July 29. Their visit sparked a roundtable discussion among local recovery groups about treating opioid use. 
“Success rates in recovery are pretty low,” Johnson said. But methadone is considered the gold standard — and it’s important that people in town have the option for treatment, he said. 
In 2024, 183 Vermonters died from opioid-related deaths, and five of those deaths happened in Bennington County, according to data from the Vermont Department of Health. 
While many embrace the opening, there are still some in Bennington who have a stigma about methadone, Cossey said. He’s confident that stigma comes from a lack of education. 
“We’re giving out medication to people that suffer from a clinically diagnosed disorder,” Cossey said. 
It’s a highly regulated medication. The clinic was built around its pharmaceutical safe, Cossey said. That was just one required specification to follow regulations from The Drug Enforcement Administration. A $3.9 million grant from the state that lasts through July 2026 helped the clinic meet the requirements.
While methadone isn’t the only medication used to treat substance use disorder, many consider it to be the most effective. People who have been using opioids start by taking the medication every day at first, then wane off of it very slowly, Johnson said. 
“It’s basically impossible to quit cold turkey,” Johnson said. 
Methadone significantly reduces symptoms of withdrawal, which helps those prescribed the medication stabilize their life as they begin recovery, Johnson said. That stability can help people find housing, repair relationships in their life or gain employment, he said.
Johnson himself uses his experience in recovery to help others navigate the journey. He tried quitting without medications 15 to 20 times — but each time he “failed spectacularly,” he said with his eyes closed as he raised his hands in the air. 
He then started taking suboxone, another medication to treat opioid use disorder, and it has helped him remain clean for 6 years. Johnson said it helped relieve painful body aches and gastrointestinal issues he suffered as withdrawal symptoms.
Now, he considers himself a success story and tries to help others through their own recovery. Johnson said he continues to take suboxone in small doses and hopes to be able to discontinue the medication completely soon. 
Other facilities in the Bennington area, like small clinics or doctors offices, have offered other medications to treat opioid use disorder for years. But many think methadone has unique potential to help those in the early stages of recovery. 
The stigma comes from the fact that methadone is technically a psychoactive drug, Johnson said. But if someone has used heroin for years, they will not feel a high from the medication, he said. 
Other medications, like suboxone or buprenorphine, have blockers that stop people from feeling high if they continue using opioids while on the medication. With methadone, people can still feel the effects of other drugs. And that’s partly where the stigma comes from, Johnson said.

Patients at the Bennington clinic are closely monitored and must provide urine samples regularly, Cossey said. Patients prescribed methadone also receive counseling resources and are assigned a case manager, he said. 
Patients take doses in a room about the size of a telephone booth in front of an employee who sits behind a counter. After the medication is ingested patients stay for about 20 minutes while medical professionals observe them. 
Cossey said the facility is still reaching its full potential. There are still a number of staff positions available that are proving difficult to fill, he said. With more staff, the facility will be able to serve up to 400 patients, he said. Whether it’s someone’s second or tenth time in recovery, there’s no judgement, Cossey said. 
“We try to meet them more than half way,” he said.

But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring adult account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
 40 million subscribers

Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”
This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

Study refutes widespread understanding that gray wolves, anchored by young offspring, don’t move during spring denning season.
The post Yellowstone-area wolves observed moving pups to follow elk — upending scientific assumptions appeared first on WyoFile .","Scientific research has long assumed gray wolves are non-migratory during springtime, staying anchored to tend to litters of nearly helpless pups. For the first weeks of life, after all, pups are blind, deaf and extremely vulnerable.
A game camera image captured in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, however, upends that assumption. In the picture, an adult female wolf hauls a squirmy-looking pup by its hindquarters. The collared female, GPS data shows, was transporting the youngster from a den site to a new pack “rendezvous” site — effectively relocating her young family.
The photograph is part of a study, “Wolves use diverse tactics to track partially migratory prey,” that sheds new light on the evolving dynamics between ungulates and the carnivores that prey on them. 
The study, published Aug. 1 in the journal Current Biology, finds that canids with very young pups relocate homesites if their source of prey — in this case, elk — migrate.
The research helps illuminate the ways shifting ungulate migrations can impact predator behaviors and ecosystem dynamics, said senior author Arthur Middleton, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who has spent years researching ungulate migration and conservation in Wyoming.

“It’s sort of become pretty obvious to me that [ungulate migrations are] really important to the functioning of the ecosystem,” Middleton said. “But, we’ve had work to do to show how and why, and so I think this helps add another piece of that puzzle.”
This puzzle piece relates to the ways ungulate movements can directly influence the behavior of large carnivores. “That has broader implications, I think, for how we think about the migrations and why we’re trying to conserve them and things like that,” Middleton said.  
Tracking movements
The research team set out in 2019 to learn about wolf predation in more granular detail, said co-author Avery Shawler. To do that, researchers partnered with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to put collars on both prey — nearly 100 members of the large Cody elk herd — as well as their predators — 19 wolves belonging to seven packs. 
“So we were investigating wolf kill sites to see what they were killing and eating,” said Shawler, who completed her PhD at UC Berkeley in 2024.
This study area is east of Yellowstone National Park in the Absaroka Mountains, a rugged landscape home to high-alpine meadows, Douglas fir forests, aspen glades and sagebrush steppe. 
Over summer and winter seasons through 2021, scientists collected a great deal of data on the movement patterns of the animals, Shawler said.

That allowed researchers “to do movement analyses and compare GPS collar information,” she said. Through that, they realized “that different wolf packs have different strategies for tracking the Cody elk herd, which has individuals that migrate and individuals that don’t migrate.”
Wyoming Game and Fish game camera images helped bolster the collar observations. 
Ultimate findings demonstrated that gray wolves use diverse movement tactics to track partially migratory elk. Some Yellowstone Ecosystem elk only migrate short distances in the spring, and the wolf packs that tracked them generally stayed in the territory where they first established their dens. Other elk travel longer springtime distances, and the wolf packs that tracked them went to greater lengths to keep close. That includes packs with pups shifting homesites to follow migratory elk to summer range. Sometimes they carried small pups as far as 20 kilometers from their original dens. 
Because the highest source of wolf mortality can be attributed to members of other packs killing puppies, moving them is risky, Shawler said. 
The relocation of small pups was not a surprise to Game and Fish biologists and other large carnivore specialists, Shawler and Middleton said. Experts have observed that behavior on the ground for years. The finer-scaled detail provided by GPS collars confirmed their observations.

But, Middleton said, these findings counter years of assumptions by the larger body of animal researchers that migratory ungulates can escape predation in spring because wolves are anchored to dens and their largely immobile pups. The study is the first time researchers outside of the Arctic have observed gray wolves shifting their territorial range to be closer to prey during pup-rearing season.
The game camera photo captured it perfectly, Shawler noted. “Once they got that camera trap photo, literally of an adult wolf carrying a pup that was really, really young  … It was like, ‘Oh, they actually are moving the pups, and that’s over some really rugged terrain, over a pretty long distance.’”
Implications 
Previous work by Middleton illustrated that elk are highly variable and have the means to adapt to changing climate cues. 
This study takes that a step further, Shawler said. 
“There’s less research on how predators respond to that flexibility, and it would make sense that predators are also able to adapt,” she said. “So it’s just kind of adding to that literature.”
Understanding how wolves adapt to the prey’s behavior can help land managers better conserve both species, Middleton said. The study area, outside of Yellowstone National Park boundaries, encompasses human development like ranches and wilderness. That makes it a candidate for human-wildlife conflict.

Researchers generated a significant body of data, and Shawler is working to publish further work from it. 
Additional study co-authors include Kenneth J. Mills and Tony W. Mong of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department; Kristin J. Barker of UC Berkeley and Beyond Yellowstone Living Lab; and Wenjing Xu of the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre in Germany. 
The National Geographic Society, Knobloch Family Foundation, George B. Storer Foundation, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, UC Berkeley and USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported the study, which was conducted from a base at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody.

In Senate hearing, critics question regional office closures, consolidation of wildland firefighting service.
The post Forest Service faces identity crisis in USDA overhaul plan. Again. appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by Mountain Journal.
The U.S. Forest Service has been searching for an identity almost since the federal government began managing trees in the 19th century.
It started in 1876 inventorying public lands to prevent over-logging. Then it became the lumber provider to the nation. Now, just shy of its 150th birthday, the Forest Service faces another fundamental reorganization announced in late July by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.
Or not. A week after Rollins’ announcement, the Senate Agriculture Committee ordered Deputy Agriculture Secretary Stephen Vaden to present a “Review of the USDA Reorganization Proposal.” Many public lands watchdogs hoped the hearing would clarify where the idea came from and how the Forest Service’s tree focus fit in the farm-and-ranch world of the Department of Agriculture.
During the hearing on July 30, Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Arkansas, offered his appreciation that Vaden, who took the job just two weeks before Rollins announced the reorganization on July 24, was working on his third week when he was summoned to explain the plan.
Ranking member Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, was less welcoming.
“The reason for the short notice is because the administration put out a half-baked plan with no notice,” Klobuchar said. Rearranging a major department that had already lost 15,000 staff members at a time when tariffs and pests such as the screwworm are roiling farm markets is “nothing short of a disaster,” she said.
Sharon Friedman, former Forest Service regional planning director, called the Rollins memo “way out of the normal range of ‘things to do.’” In particular, she pointed to the proposal to phase out Forest Service regional offices, instead of shrink them from the current nine to some smaller number. Earlier this year, draft maps showing a two- or three-region compression were in circulation.
“I think Congress is going to say this is a really stupid, bad idea,” Friedman told Mountain Journal on July 29 ahead of the hearing. “Go back to the drawing board.”
The National Association of Forest Service Retirees was equally aghast.“We do not see anything in the proposal that would improve services or efficiency,” they wrote in a July 29 letter to Senate committee leaders Boozman and Klobuchar. “Rather, it appears to simply cut staffing and funding without describing how the work will continue to get done. It provides the classic direction to do more with less.”
National Association of Forest Service Retirees Chairman Steve Ellis told Mountain Journal the proposed reorganization of the Forest Service is nothing new. “I’ve been through a lot of these in my career, going back to when Jimmy Carter was in the White House,” he said. “The political ones are easy to smell, and this has the political smell to it. I doubt that it came from the Forest Service. It came from higher up. They were told, ‘Eliminate regional offices and station offices — figure it out.’”
Where to call home?
While the impact that Rollins’ reorganization plan might have on the Forest Service has drawn particular attention, it affects all 29 agencies within the Agriculture Department. Rollins told Politico on Friday that “perhaps 50 to 70% of our Washington, D.C. staff will want to move” to five new hubs the agency is creating and the rest should seek jobs in the private sector.
That amounts to about 2,600 of the 4,600 USDA staff now in Washington, D.C. offices. The department has about 100,000 employees nationwide, 90% of whom work outside the national headquarters area. 
The regional hubs would be in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis, Indiana; Fort Collins, Colorado; and Salt Lake City, Utah. The memo did not say if the Forest Service regional offices would be redistributed among those five cities or eliminated altogether. 
The Forest Service has three regions serving or affecting Wyoming. The Northern Region 1 based in Missoula, Montana, oversees the Custer-Gallatin National Forest around Yellowstone National Park. It also supervises the Black Hills National Forest across the South Dakota border by Newcastle.
The Intermountain Region 4, based in Ogden, Utah, sprawls across several state borders. It oversees all of Wyoming’s Bridger-Teton National Forest, headquartered in Jackson. It also manages the Caribou-Targhee National Forest, which has offices in Pocatello and St. Anthony, Idaho, but significant impact in Wyoming.
Rocky Mountain Region 2 oversees the Bighorn National Forest, based in Sheridan, the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest, based in Laramie, and the Shoshone National Forest, based in Cody. Region 2 also handles the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest, based in Fort Collins, Colorado.
Region 2’s central headquarters is in Lakewood, Colorado. Fort Collins has been proposed as one of the USDA “hubs” where some conglomeration of the agency’s 29 departments and services might be concentrated.

The overlaps matter because Forest Service regional offices typically handle federal-state projects such as Good Neighbor Authority agreements. Wyoming has had as many as 19 active GNA agreements affecting six separate national forests and two regions. Regional office planning and legal staff typically manage the National Environmental Policy Act analyses, Endangered Species Act consultations and other matters that affect multiple national forest landscapes.
Rebuilding that chain of command for those projects would have to be part of the USDA restructuring. Friedman, the former planning director, noted that similar renegotiations would have to take place for many Native American tribes that have forestry and wildlife management agreements with the Forest Service.
Vaden told senators that the plan removed some layers of middle management. “But that does not automatically mean everyone located in a former regional office of an agency will be moved,” he said. Vaden also pledged that USDA would help with moving costs for current employees, while “building the next generation of USDA leadership” in the regional hubs.
Most of Wednesday’s Senate hearing focused on two issues: Why there was so little advance notice of the plan and what senators’ districts were being considered for receiving the USDA jobs Rollins was moving out of Washington, D.C. 
Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, praised the reorganization’s goals, but warned he needed to see more collaboration with Congress.
“There’s a difference between you selecting hubs on your own and if we work together and come up with a plan,” Hoeven said. “Is this an outcome that we’re going to talk about, or a fait accompli?”
But Vaden did reveal a few expectations for the Forest Service.
Sen. Ben Jay Luján, D-New Mexico, asked about the impact of “eliminating a regional office” of the Forest Service. Vaden replied that the Forest Service’s national human resources office in Albuquerque would not be affected in the reorganization, but that “the regional office will no longer be there.” Its building is already on a federal list to be closed and sold, and its employees would “be absorbed to other areas or asked to move.”
In his testimony, Vaden said one of the biggest reasons for the organization was to get the USDA workforce out of the National Capitol Region, which has “one of the highest costs of living in the country.” Federal salaries include a “locality rate,” or pay boost, to help employees afford expensive areas. The Washington, D.C. locality rate is 33.94% above a federal job’s base pay. Federal workers with new families couldn’t afford to buy homes in the Capitol area, where prices are averaging more than $800,000, he said. 
What saves money?
“If you’re really looking for savings and belt tightening, focusing on the higher level of the organization doesn’t bother me,” said Mary Erickson, the recently retired supervisor of the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. “It’s not like you couldn’t downsize the regional offices, but the transitional costs of that are daunting. As you eliminate regional offices, where does that work go? And how do you do that in a year’s time? That’s a lot of work. And they say they don’t want to do this in fire season. Those are pretty long these days.”
Erickson pointed out that Fort Collins’ locality rate is 30.52%, resulting in almost no payroll savings. And although Salt Lake City’s locality rate is 17.06%, Utah’s public land is predominantly managed by the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, not the Forest Service.
“There’s been no explanation for those locations,” Erickson said. “No one seems to know who’s the mastermind behind this design.”
Nor does there appear to be any acknowledgement of previous federal reorganization attempts. Congress created a Special Agent in the Agriculture Department to survey the nation’s public forests in 1876, and opened a Division of Forestry in 1881. A decade later, Congress passed oversight of “forest reserves” to the Interior Department. President Theodore Roosevelt moved it back to Agriculture in 1905, naming Gifford Pinchot the first chief of the Forest Service.

An official history of the Forest Service’s first century labels eight more evolutions, including “The War Years,” “Environmentalism/Public Participation Era” and “Ecosystem Management and the Future Era.” 
Ellis recalled the attempt at slimming down the BLM during the Clinton administration.
“They decided to take the district office layer out, which is like removing the forest supervisor layer in the National Forest System,” Ellis said. “It ended up costing a lot of money to move people around and get out of office leases. It ended up being a total flop. When the second Bush administration came on, they quietly put that layer back in.”
The first Trump administration took a similar track in 2019 when it moved the BLM headquarters out of Washington, D.C. Staff were dispersed to new offices in Colorado, Nevada, Utah and several other bases.
A 2021 survey of BLM workers by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility reported that 87% of reassigned employees either retired or quit rather than move. The field offices were staffed largely by new hires who lacked the scientific or experiential backgrounds of the former staff. “This lack of expertise in new hires has resulted in a shunning of science at the agency, and even a demonization of intellectual culture in some cases,” the PEER report stated.
It also resulted in a paucity of workers handling public business. At the time, the Utah area reported an average of one BLM employee for every 37,277 acres of public land. Arches National Park, which is surrounded by BLM lands, had one employee for every 1,530 acres.
Biden administration Interior Secretary Tracy Stone-Manning moved much of the BLM headquarters staff back to Washington in 2022. But she also reinforced the Colorado office, expanding its contingent from 27 positions under Trump to 56.
Friedman now runs the forestry policy blog Smokey Wire. She was a planning director in 2007 when a “Transformation Team” explored ways of performing Forest Service duties better. But Friedman noted her own inability to find out what it actually accomplished: “I couldn’t find any documentation for the effort. It wasn’t even clear whom I would ask at the Forest Service. Historian? Archivist? I got some phone numbers and emails, but no one returned the messages.”
Some of that effort looked into moving the Forest Service from Agriculture to Interior. A 2009 Government Accountability Office report concluded “a move would provide few efficiencies in the short term and could diminish the role the Forest Service plays in state and private land management … [If] the objective of a move is to improve land management and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the agencies’ diverse programs, other options might achieve better results.”
The 2009 GAO report also cataloged other past consolidation initiatives. One was the colocation of wildland firefighting experts from the Forest Service, BLM, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs to create the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. That took place in 1965.
Where’s the fire?
One particular problem drags public lands management off balance: wildfire.
While logging trees and grazing cows and digging trail occur far from the average American’s attention, forest fires are literally front-page news. The Forest Service routinely spends nearly half its annual budget fighting fire. It handles between 70 and 80% of the public land ignitions, with Interior agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management chasing most of the rest.
Federal firefighters have long chaffed at being just a tool in a larger agency’s land management toolbox, according to Freidman.
“There’s a tension between wildfire people and everybody else,” she said. “They got pay raises and nobody else did. They want to work for other wildfire people, because they feel they’re a national asset. They think they shouldn’t have others holding them back when they could be making money.”

But wildfire and public land management are woven together in a tight braid. Fire-dependent ecosystems cover most of the western United States. Local ranger districts not only map and monitor their surrounding forest for fire potential, their staffs often donate their time to the community volunteer fire department and ambulance service.
Removing fire duties from the Forest Service would “hollow out” the agency, according to Ellis.
“Fire is integrated in every program the Forest Service does,” he said. “Anything you do on public lands affects the fuel. It isn’t just burning slash piles. It’s how you graze range land. It’s timber harvest. That’s all fuels management. The fuel in Los Angeles fires [last January] was homes.”
During the hearing, Sen. Klobuchar asked if there was a bigger plan to move the Forest Service, or parts of it, to some other cabinet agency. She particularly wanted to know about the fate of wildland firefighting.
Vaden replied that the president’s budget, not the reorganization plan, called for the centralization of wildfire services. In other responses, Vaden said the Missoula-based Fire Lab would not be moving, and that the Salt Lake City regional hub was chosen in part because it offered “aviation assets” that would help the Forest Service in the “administration’s plan regarding centralizing wildfire efforts.”
Congress had already shown resistance to other Trump administration moves. Last week, both the House and Senate Appropriations committees rejected a plan to wrap the Forest Service’s firefighting duties into a new wildland fire management service housed in the Interior Department. Despite a Trump executive order creating the consolidated wildfire service and Forest Service and Interior budget reports detailing how it would work, congressional budgeters put the 2026 wildfire allocations back in their traditional multiagency bankbooks.
“The committee is disappointed with the utter lack of regard for complying with Congressional intent on spending funds as appropriated,” the Senate Appropriations Committee bill report stated. On other pages, the Senate committee overruled Trump’s order changing the name of North America’s highest mountain from Denali to McKinley. And it blocked an Interior Department plan to hand over some unnamed small national park facilities to state management.
“Over my whole career, the president’s budget, if you took it as reality, was completely drastic,” Erickson said. “We always expected it was going to be moderated by the Congressional process. Up to this point with Trump, you hadn’t seen that. Maybe we’re seeing some good signs there.”

But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.

Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A program meant to offer state resources to Nebraska children suspected of being abused or neglected while keeping more of them at home and out of foster care is not being used as intended, an inspector general’s report alleges. 
The Office of Inspector General for Child Welfare began investigating the state’s Alternative Response (AR) program after it received nine notices between 2021 and 2024 of children having suffered serious injuries and three of them dying within months of their families being assessed through the program, which is manned by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

AR, according to the report, is recognized as a best practice in more than 20 states. It is used as a less adversarial and more collaborative method of working with children and families to assess possible cases of child endangerment while keeping more children with their families. 
Though AR is meant to be used for mid- to low-risk cases, the report found nearly half of the families DHHS assessed were deemed to be high-risk or worse of future mistreatment. The OIG report notes that between 2021-2024, DHHS completed AR assessments for more than 17,000 families, and over 7,800 of them qualified as high or very high risk. 
AR was implemented as a pilot program in Nebraska in 2014. It was added as a permanent program in 2020. Inspector General Jennifer Carter noted that during its pilot years, there were no reported cases of serious injuries or deaths related to AR assessments. The reports of kids getting harmed started after the program became permanent, which is part of what prompted the investigation, Carter said. 
In a written response included in the report, DHHS Director of Children and Family Services Alyssa Bish argued current regulations don’t mandate how AR cases should be assigned based on risk level and noted that cases are excluded from AR when a child is determined to be unsafe. 
The OIG report confirmed that DHHS has not broken the law.

Bish explained that “safety” and “risk” are two separate measurements. Safety is an immediate assessment based on active threats of serious harm to the child, while risk is a more long-term evaluation of potential for future harm. 
“It is important to clarify that the level of risk can only be evaluated after an intake is determined to be eligible for AR and the assigned Children and Family Services Specialist has made contact with the family,” Bish wrote. 
Carter’s report criticized multiple deficiencies found in DHHS’ AR process, noting multiple errors found within the assessments of the nine cases the Inspector General’s Office reviewed in depth. 
The report also raised concerns about DHHS’ “limited review” of each family’s history when assigning AR cases. In more than one of the nine reviewed cases, reports of suspected abuse within the family were missed, including at least one in which the OIG said there had been a report of abuse filed within the family nine months before the AR assessment. 
“A family could have extensive previous intakes over many years that indicate a pattern of concerning behavior that [is] not considered if outside that six-month window,” Carter argued. 
The OIG report makes several recommendations, including that DHHS improve its data tracking and find ways to encourage families to more easily engage more with state resources. Of the nine cases, a majority of families declined DHHS resources after receiving an AR assessment. 
“It is impossible to say that AR services being provided would have stopped the incidents from occurring in those cases,” Carter wrote in the report. “But in AR cases, unlike court-involved cases, engaging the family during the AR assessment is the only way to provide the family with the supports they need to address concerns in the home.”
Carter praised DHHS for enhancing its data tracking system in February to include a note when families decline state services, calling it “a great step.” She suggested DHHS ought to align its data on AR with HHS data on the agency’s more common Traditional Response method to alleged abuse or neglect. The goal: to be able to compare the effectiveness of each program under certain circumstances. 
Bish noted multiple updates DHHS has made to its AR system before the OIG report came out, including a new tool that reviews the frequency and quality of contact with families within the program. However, Bish noted that this tool does not evaluate families’ level of engagement with state resources for families. 
“DHHS acknowledges the importance of this recommendation and is open to further exploration and development of metrics or tools that could more explicitly assess engagement outcomes,” Bish wrote. 
Carter emphasized that despite her critiques, Alternative Response remains a useful tool that can recognize nuanced cases, such as families in poverty that could be mistaken as neglectful. 
However, she argued that more attention should be paid to the outcomes of families assessed under AR and suggested DHHS and the Nebraska Legislature should consider whether risk level of future abuse or neglect should be a factor in assigning AR cases. 
DHHS did not respond to requests for additional comment on the report.

The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.

Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

Marsha Blackburn. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn holds a significant lead over U.S. Rep. John Rose in the 2026 Republican primary for Tennessee governor, according to a poll released by the conservative think tank Beacon Center. 
The Beacon poll gives Blackburn a 68% to 14% advantage among the 571 Republican voters the group polled from July 27 to August 1. 
The poll was conducted before Blackburn officially announced her campaign at the start of August. Rose entered the campaign in March.
Early polling leads aren’t always an indication of who will win.
When Gov. Bill Lee ran in a five-person Republican primary in 2018, he trailed in polling until the campaign’s final weeks. 
A March 2018 poll conducted by the Washington, D.C.-based Save the Children Action Network, showed Lee with 7% support, trailing two other Republicans with 20% support each. 
Lee is term-limited and can’t run for reelection.

Blackburn has higher name recognition than Rose, who represents a U.S. Congressional district covering parts of middle and east Tennessee, after winning two statewide elections to the U.S. Senate. She’s also a close ally of President Donald Trump, who has not made an endorsement in the race yet. 
Shortly after her 2024 reelection to the Senate, Blackburn was rumored to be interested in running for governor. But she has waited nearly a year, allowing her to use her federal campaign funds for advertisements and to travel the state using that money.
Now that she’s officially entered the race, Blackburn can’t use federal campaign funds in the governor’s race as federal campaign finance laws prohibit the comingling of funds for state and federal races. 
Rose has shown he’s willing to put his personal funds, loaning his campaign $5 million. 
In 2018, the last time there was an open primary for Tennessee’s governor, the candidates spent almost $50 million. 
Memphis City Council member Jerri Green is the only Democrat to announce a candidacy in the Democratic primary.

(Courtesy of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife)In an amazing court victory for wild wolves and advocates who tirelessly speak on their behalf, the federal district court in Missoula, Montana, ruled that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service violated the Endangered Species Act when it determined that gray wolves in the Western United States do not warrant federal protections.
Western Watersheds Project, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, WildEarth Guardians, International Wildlife Coexistence Network, Predator Defense, Protect the Wolves, Trap Free Montana, Wilderness Watch, Friends of the Clearwater, and Nimiipuu Protecting the Environment filed a lawsuit in January challenging the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s denial of their petitions to list a Western U.S. distinct population segment of gray wolves under the Endangered Species Act, or alternatively, to re-list the Northern Rocky Mountain distinct population segment, which Congress “delisted” in 2011.
Federal court overturns decision denying Endangered Species protections to wolves

The ruling means that the Fish and Wildlife Service’s finding that gray wolves in the West do not qualify for listing is vacated and sent back to the agency for a new decision, consistent with the Endangered Species Act and best available science.
We hope this order will help blunt some of the lingering bigotry, senseless killing and fear mongering that nearly wiped wolves out before they were listed as endangered under the provisions of the federal Endangered Species Act in 1974.
Wolves remain under state control in Idaho following legal victory for conservationists 

The court order states that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service failed to consider the “best available science” on wolf populations and the impacts of hunting and trapping; the full extent of the species’ historical range; and the threat posed by inadequate state and federal regulations that often bow to political pressure.
The court ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to re-analyze threats to the gray wolf population in the West in accordance with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. These include the requirement to use the best available science.
Specifically, the court noted the agency failed to consider wolves’ lost historic range throughout the West in its assessment.
The court also ruled that the Fish and Wildlife Service  failed to apply the best available science on population estimates and genetic threats from their small population size; incorrectly assumed connectivity among wolves in the West would continue despite high levels of mortality in the Northern Rockies.
To sum it up, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service didn’t follow the law to protect wolves from Montana’s, Idaho’s, and Wyoming’s wolf extermination policies. Wolves have yet to recover across the West, and allowing a few states to undertake aggressive wolf slaughters is inconsistent with the law.
The Alliance successfully sued to overturn the delisting of the gray wolf in 2012, but Montana’s Democratic Sen. Jon Tester broke his campaign promise to not use riders to overturn court decisions and attached a rider to a must-pass Defense appropriation bill to remove wolves from Endangered Species list despite the court’s order. It is time to once again manage wolves in the Northern Rockies and throughout the west based on science, not politics, since Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming have demonstrated that they are not capable of doing so.
I would like to thank Matt Bishop, an attorney at Western Environmental Law Center for representing us and winning.

But right now Michigan’s kids are being exposed to increased political polarization, growing ideological extremism and high levels of political violence.
Although extremism and political violence are not new, virtual platforms allow fringe beliefs and hateful ideas to gain traction, particularly with young people. Kids encounter a huge amount of supremacist ideologies in virtual forums, gaming platforms and social media, where racist, anti-LGBT, antisemitic and misogynistic content thrive.
According to a 2023 Gallup Poll, teens report using social media on average 4.8 hours a day, a trend that is not only linked to negative effects on physical and mental health but also exposes teens to hate-based content. Although social media can offer many benefits to teen mental health – including through opportunities for connection, creativity and identity development – many social media platforms use algorithms to target harmful, hate-based content to vulnerable young people. 
The targeting of misogynistic content to adolescent boys has been especially well-documented. Gaming chats have become notorious for the sexist attitudes that prevail there, including both misogynistic and anti-LGBTQ+ ideas, while popular male lifestyle influencers play into the male loneliness epidemic while advocating violence against women and downplaying sexual violence.

These kinds of messages risk normalizing everyday harassment and violence against girls and nonbinary kids. According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 13.8% of high school students in Michigan reported experiencing sexual violence, a 21% increase from 2017 to 2023. Reports of sexual violence are even higher for girls and students identifying as LGBTQ+.
But hate is not only spread online. Political extremism is becoming more commonplace and puts vulnerable populations at risk. Research from the Southern Poverty Law Center shows Michigan is home to 34 hate and anti-government extremist groups, making our communities less safe for Black people, women, immigrants, Jewish people, Muslims and LGBTQ+ people. 
Just five years ago, members of one such anti-government extremist group were indicted in a plot to kidnap the governor that occurred following a relentless online disinformation campaign fueled by sexism. More recently, a politically motivated assassin took the lives of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. 
Increasing polarization and ideological extremism makes it difficult for our leaders to do their jobs and keep our public institutions working. From 2022 to 2024, Michigan has seen 80 incidents of public officials facing threats and harassment – including doxing, stalking and death threats – in the course of their work as civil servants.
In a recent survey conducted by the Bridging Divides Institute and CivicPulse, 36% of school board officials reported experiencing hostility in 2024. This hostility does not just harm school leaders, but can also create an unwelcoming environment for students, especially if the hostility centers around the politicization of a child’s identity.
It’s time for us to lower the temperature. We can demonstrate the values we want kids today to take into adulthood, whether that means lawmakers reaching across the aisle or neighbors working together to better their community. We can all find things to agree on when we listen with curiosity and set aside the defensiveness. 
Some legislators are already making efforts to reduce tensions and build relationships. State Reps. Brenda Carter and Greg Markkanen became the first lawmakers to invite each other to visit their districts as part of the inaugural Michigan Legislative Exchange Project, which seeks to strengthen understanding and cooperation between lawmakers in Michigan. 
We also need to address the role of online platforms in allowing misogyny, disinformation and extremism to flourish. A Stanford University study found a majority of middle school students surveyed could not evaluate the credibility of online content, demonstrating the need to equip young people with the tools to identify misinformation. 
Social media platforms have become essential tools for promoting democracy and civic engagement, but they also lack the guardrails to prevent the spread of conspiracy theories and the promotion of violent extremism.

One morning in February 2023, a small group of mineral owners arrived at the North Dakota Capitol on a mission. They had traveled from across the state and other parts of the country to explain to lawmakers how the powerful oil and gas companies had been chipping away at their income.
It’s not easy to recruit people to testify during the winter months of the legislative session. Ranchers are busy with the calving season. Snowbirds have relocated to warmer climates. It’s a more than three-hour drive for those living in the Bakken oil field. 

This is the second story in a series. Read the first story here.

But those who made it to Bismarck lined up at a podium to share details of their own experiences and the broader concerns affecting the estimated 300,000 people who receive money from the industry in exchange for the right to their underground minerals. For nearly a decade, they had grappled with companies withholding significant portions of their royalty payments without explaining how they determined how much to deduct, as the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica reported last week. 
Now they were at the Capitol for a specific reason: They wanted legislators to require companies to provide more information so owners could discern if they were being paid correctly, and to impose penalties if companies failed to comply. 
Shane Leverenz, who manages income his extended family receives from numerous oil wells, read aloud email responses from companies to illustrate the lack of cooperation mineral owners face when they request information. “We are not obligated to mail each owner a calculation as to how their interest was calculated,” one company wrote. 
“There is no transparency,” Leverenz told the legislators. Leverenz, whose great-grandfather homesteaded in North Dakota and had his property deed signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, has helped organize royalty owners on this issue in recent years. Leverenz grew up in Epping, a town of fewer than 100 people in the northwest part of the state, and traveled to North Dakota from Texas, where he now lives, to testify.

After input from Leverenz and others, lawmakers decided to create a new state program that they hoped would address conflicts between royalty owners and companies. In particular, mineral owners had mounting concerns over postproduction deductions, the money companies withhold to cover the costs of processing and transporting minerals after they are extracted and before they are sold. Companies say they are allowed to pass on a share of those costs, while royalty owners say they shouldn’t bear that responsibility because in most cases lease agreements don’t mention those expenses. 
The state’s “postproduction royalty oversight program” had the support of the industry, but it was far less than what Leverenz and other owners wanted. In the two years since its creation, the program has not lived up to its name and has not alleviated owners’ concerns over deductions or transparency, an investigation by the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica found. The program has resolved 69 cases so far, and none have involved postproduction deductions, according to documents obtained under a public records request. A case can represent a complaint or question from a royalty owner.
“The legislative intent was supposed to be addressing the issue of the postproduction costs that they were hitting people with,” said Rep. Don Longmuir, a Republican from Stanley, in the northwest corner of the state. 
The newsrooms’ investigation found that the program has focused on other issues. It has instead helped owners resolve complaints about companies withholding payments entirely and failing to pay interest on late royalty payments, records show. Some mineral owners said in interviews that they do not trust state officials to help them get information about the deductions and therefore have not tried to use the program.  
Leverenz said the program, also referred to as the ombudsman program, has not accomplished what he and other royalty owners were told it would. He has taken six complaints to the ombudsman; three were resolved but three remain open, including two for more than a year. The unresolved complaints do not involve deductions, he said, and focus on other issues with his family’s royalty payments. 
“The ombudsman is running into the same thing that I have, where there’s just no response from the oil companies or they stalled,” Leverenz said. “There’s been no forward momentum.”
Ron Webb, who coordinates the program within the state’s Department of Agriculture, said it has helped facilitate communication between mineral owners and companies. He said the program is voluntary and does not have authority to compel companies to change how they calculate payments or even to provide information. “Oil companies are not required to work with us,” Webb said.
The program no longer promotes itself as being able to oversee concerns about royalty deductions even though that was part of the legislative intent. On the department’s website and in a brochure, the word “postproduction” has been dropped from the program’s name even though it is in the title of the law that created it.
The department’s legal counsel, Dutch Bialke, said the name of the law is irrelevant to how the program operates.
“The title is entirely legally non-binding and has no legal effect,” he wrote in an email, citing North Dakota law. 
  A bill introduced in 2023 established what it called the postproduction royalty oversight program. The program has since dropped the word “postproduction” from its name. (Obtained by North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.)
‘Nothing is clear’ 
Ever since Neil Christensen and his sisters noticed in 2016 that Hess Corp. was withholding nearly 25% of their royalty income — up from less than 1% just two years earlier — his family has tried to get answers from the company. 
He traveled to Minot, North Dakota, some years ago to meet with Hess representatives at their production offices. He also called the company’s accounting office and its royalty owner hotline, but he said their explanations didn’t make sense. 
“It doesn’t seem as if the company has a large interest in explaining themselves,” Christensen said. Spreadsheets kept by his family show withholdings have been as much as 42% in recent years. “The transparency issue is a big problem with oil operators and mineral owners.”

The royalty statements can be hundreds of pages long but provide only a general description of the reasons for the deductions, leaving owners unable to verify the companies’ costs and whether they are being paid a fair share. Christensen’s family and others said they have had payments reduced for expenses the companies incurred years earlier.
“Nothing is clear,” said his sister Naomi Staruch, who has spent most of her career working in finance for banks and churches in Minnesota. “I would get so frustrated really looking hard at the statements.” 
Diana and Bob Skarphol, who have advocated for years on behalf of royalty owners, said confusing and overwhelming royalty statements are a common concern. The couple received one statement last year that included 39 pages of calculations for a single well — including reductions to past royalties going back nine years. The Skarphols received $1.15 that month from the production of the well.
Merrill Piepkorn, a Democratic former state senator from Fargo who was the prime sponsor of the transparency legislation, said oil companies’ tactics are “obfuscation through transparency.” 
“You get so much information, there’s no way to find what you’re looking for,” said Piepkorn, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2024. 
Todd Slawson, chair of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said royalty statements are complex in part because state regulators within the last decade began requiring companies to include additional categories of information. Hess said it maintains an online portal where royalty owners can access their royalty information and operates a call center that mineral owners can contact with questions. 
North Dakota does not regulate the costs that companies can pass on to individual owners, though the state and federal governments regulate deductions on government-owned land. The state audits the royalties paid on state-owned minerals to ensure the amounts are correct and, since 1979, the state’s leases do not allow deductions. But private mineral owners don’t have that same access and often learn about deductions by comparing their statements with one another. 
“It’s kind of all rigged against the individual royalty owner,” Leverenz said.

State officials have told mineral owners that they can’t get involved in private disputes and that litigation is the owners’ best recourse. But litigation isn’t financially feasible for most families, according to attorney Josh Swanson, who represents mineral owners.
“It easily exceeds six figures, and that’s cost-prohibitive for most folks,” Swanson said. “Part of the playbook for a lot of operators is making these things as cost-prohibitive as they can.”
Swanson was the attorney Janice Arnson and her family hired to try to get answers from Hess. Hess had been deducting between 15% and 36% of their royalty income each month since 2015, according to a spreadsheet maintained by Arnson. They had no luck getting an explanation from the company until they hired Swanson in 2017. When Hess responded, a company attorney said in a letter that the deductions were “proper and permissible” under the terms of the lease. While Swanson disagreed, the family declined to pursue litigation because “it was going to be an expensive suit.”

“We were one small, little family,” said Arnson. “We just didn’t have the resources against Hess to fight.”
(Hess did not contest or comment on Arnson’s or Christensen’s claims.)
Some royalty owners have turned to the Northwest Landowners Association, a nonprofit advocacy group, for help. Troy Coons, the group’s chair, said he has fielded multiple calls a week from royalty owners who are angry that state leaders have not helped them with the deductions. “It’s a massive concern for people,” said Coons, whose group has sued the state on behalf of property owners on a different issue. “We’re not supposed to be bearing the burden of expenses.”

Lawmakers initially had bipartisan support in 2023 for a bill that would have guaranteed mineral owners access to electronic spreadsheets detailing their payments and would have required companies to provide more information on how they calculate a royalty owner’s share of the income from each well. It also would have directed courts to require companies to reimburse royalty owners for attorneys’ fees if they successfully sued for the information. 
But that bill was discarded in favor of legislation creating the royalty oversight program. 
The Legislature “took our bill and they stripped it of everything, and they shoved the ombudsman program into it,” Leverenz said. They created the program “with the promises that, you know, this is going to be the answer to all the issues that have been brought up over the years with the royalty owners.”
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Republican from Williston, initially backed both bills. The senator said he hoped the bill creating the ombudsman program would be amended in the legislative process to give it more authority to advocate on behalf of mineral owners. That didn’t happen.  
“That would have been, I think, more beneficial to royalty owners,” said Bekkedahl, who ultimately voted against it.

‘Barking up a tree’ 
In pitching the program to lawmakers in 2023, Doug Goehring, the state’s agriculture commissioner, said the goal was to “try to develop some resolution” for royalty owners with questions about their payments, including concerns over deductions.
The bill required a report to legislators. Goehring told lawmakers he would share with them “full and complete information concerning the cases” handled by the program and the issues faced by mineral owners in order to inform future legislation. “We’ll certainly provide you scenarios, situations, and some of the challenges and difficulties we’ve dealt with,” Goehring, a Republican, testified in 2023. “And even some suggestions about how you correct some of this moving forward.” 
The result has fallen short of what Goehring pledged in testimony, the news organizations found. Goehring now says it is not the program’s job to find resolution for royalty owners who question the deductions. “We don’t have a leg to stand on to try and advocate or try to extort money out of the company,” Goehring said. He said an exception is if deductions are specifically prohibited in leases, but most agreements, especially those signed decades ago, are silent on the issue of deductions.
Instead of a detailed report, Goehring delivered a one-page summary to legislators in September that broadly categorized the issues handled through the program. Legislators accepted the report without discussion. Goehring said a more detailed report was not necessary. “They don’t want to know that,” he said. “We generally don’t write reports in that manner. We give them the basic information.”

Of the 147 cases filed with the program, about half remain unresolved, including more than two dozen that have been pending since 2023. Goehring said some of the cases remain open at the request of royalty owners.
Two of the pending cases involve postproduction deductions, including one that has been open since September 2023, according to Bialke, the Agriculture Department’s legal counsel.
The cases are assigned to two energy companies that serve as ombudsmen, Diamond Resources and Aurora Energy Solutions, which contact the companies on behalf of the mineral owners. Neither of the companies responded to questions from the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica. 
The news organizations paid $425 to obtain records related to the cases that had been resolved as of late June. In those cases, the ombudsmen have answered royalty owners’ questions and obtained answers for them when companies had not been responsive. In some cases, they mediated solutions that resulted in royalty owners receiving payments they were owed, records show. 
In one case, an ombudsman spent nearly 10 months going back and forth with a company until the royalty owner got paid. In other cases, ombudsmen helped royalty owners understand technical issues related to taxes and the probate process after inheriting minerals. The department redacted company names from the documents released, with Bialke citing state law.
“It has been extremely helpful for frustrated royalty owners who cannot get their questions answered,” said Slawson of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, who also owns an energy company. “Having deductions suddenly show up on revenue checks and questions not being answered or not explained well can lead to suspicions of wrongdoing.”
North Dakota mineral owners say oil companies unfairly keep millions from checks without oversight

Kenneth Schmidt, who owns minerals near Ray in Williams County, contacted the program after struggling to convince a company that it owed interest on late royalty payments as mandated by state law. It took a few months, he said, but the company paid him.
“I was very satisfied with the program,” said Schmidt. “Instead of going to an attorney and I’ll pay $400 an hour, they did it for free, but through the state.”
Goehring said the program has been successful, citing feedback from the industry as well as the fact that no bills related to royalty deductions were introduced during this year’s legislative session, the first time in nearly a decade.
“If there’s no bills that are coming up, then isn’t that an indication? It’s kind of like if you don’t have a cough, then maybe you don’t have a cold,” he said.
While the program has resolved disputes like Schmidt’s, which are more cut-and-dried, it isn’t well equipped to handle more complex disagreements, Goehring said. That isn’t a surprise to one of the lawmakers who worked on the bill. 
“I don’t doubt that in some cases, facilitating that communication probably helped, but I don’t think it gives all the answers to the royalty owners that they’re looking for,” Bekkedahl said.
A number of royalty owners told the news organizations they simply don’t trust the program to help. “I didn’t feel the ombudsman program had any teeth in it whatsoever to do anything,” said Brian Anderson, who has not filed a complaint even though he wants companies to more fully explain their deductions. “They’ll placate you; they’re not going to do anything about it.”
Curtis Trulson, a royalty owner in Mountrail County, agreed: Going to the program, he said, is just “barking up a tree.”

And she is curious: Wouldn’t Nebraska fans be game for taking a train to see a Husker football game? An Omaha concert? A Grand Island museum? 
Starting Aug. 19 in Columbus, Juarez and ProRail Nebraska advocates are kicking off a statewide series of five  town halls to gauge the interest Nebraskans have in passenger rail options. 
The feedback is for a legislative interim study also evaluating existing passenger rail infrastructure in Nebraska — which sponsors say could lead to legislation proposing ways to create easier commutes between Nebraska cities.  
 Nebraska ‘far behind’

Juarez said her hope is for a frequent and steady Omaha-Lincoln route, but she also sees potential for better connection from western Nebraska to the state’s capital city of Lincoln or to its largest city, Omaha.
“Transportation is a priority in our state, and I’m disappointed in the lack of progress we’ve made,” she said. “I want communities across Nebraska to see what a great asset passenger rail can be.”
 

Town hall schedule
(Times are 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., except in Omaha, which is 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.)
Aug. 19, Columbus, library, 2500 14th St., in English and Spanish 
Sept. 5, Lincoln, First Presbyterian Church, 840 S. 17th St.
Sept. 9, North Platte, library, 120 W. 4th St.
Sept. 16, Grand Island, library, 1124 W 2nd St.
Sept. 22, Omaha, Willa Cather library, 1905 S. 44th St.



She referred to a trip she recently made to Salt Lake City, where she once lived. She said a light rail system allowed her to ride from the airport to downtown and her hotel for $1.25.
“It reinforced in my mind how far behind Nebraska is in mass transportation,” said Juarez. “That kind of reliability and affordability should be available to everyone in Nebraska.”
According to the Juarez-led legislative resolution seeking the study, interest in rail transit and public transportation has grown in Nebraska, especially among young professionals. In addition to trying to retain homegrown talent and meeting workforce needs, the resolution said passenger rail projects can drive tourism and large public and private investment.
The study, among other tasks, will examine plans that the Amtrak passenger railroad may have relevant to Nebraska. Juarez said the study and recommendations from the public town halls will help inform legislation she plans to present in January. 
Costs to buy and own a vehicle are fast increasing, Juarez noted. “These transportation systems need to be in place, because there are people who can’t even afford to buy a car,” she said.
A major roadblock to expanding passenger rail service, she acknowledged, is cost. Juarez said she recognizes that “plenty of research” still is ahead.
A less expensive pathway, Juarez said, would be to use existing rails, perhaps adding more frequent intercity Amtrak trips between, say, Omaha and Lincoln.
 California Zephyr

Currently, she said, Nebraska’s passenger rail service is limited to Amtrak’s California Zephyr route that stops in Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings, Holdrege and McCook on its way from Chicago to Emeryville, California. Nebraska stops are typically in the late night or early morning hours, not geared toward workers or a daily outing.

“It’s what we call a long-distance train that runs daily, although the time-keeping in the wintertime can be challenging,” said Clyde Anderson, a representative of ProRail Nebraska. 
Snow and the fact the Zephyr shares tracks with freight trains can throw off schedules. Anderson said pickup and drop off times aren’t convenient for commuters wanting to move from one Nebraska town to another.
“There’s a lot of people who ride between intermediate points,” he said, not necessarily from one end of the route to the other end.
Juarez has held information-gathering discussions with sources including representatives of a local railroad. One suggestion Juarez said she received during preliminary discussions was to start with test excursion trips headed to a Nebraska football or volleyball game, for example.
The Nebraska Department of Transportation said in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner that passenger rail currently is “not viable in the state because the development of such a route would pose a significant cost, and there is currently no mechanism to pay for such a project with existing state revenue.”
The state has been involved with groups dedicated to expansion and study of passenger rail, including the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission (MIPRC), which Nebraska helped establish. However, lawmakers withdrew from the multi-state commission under a 2015 proposal by then-State Sen. Bill Kintner of Papillion, who said in his bill’s intent statement that membership benefits “do not outweigh the expenditure of tax dollars on dues.”
The commission in conjunction with the Federal Railroad Administration released a draft  four years ago for a 40-year regional plan, identifying key corridors. The plan at that time did not extend beyond Omaha, the NDOT statement said, adding that no route into Nebraska is officially planned.

At least two state senators in recent years have launched efforts to rejoin the commission that coordinates and supports improvements to passenger rail service among its members. The most recent proposal was earlier this year by Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island. Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln made a push in 2023, saying also that it was important for Nebraska to have a voice in future passenger development and funding allocation.
“Whether the Nebraska Legislature should choose to reenter the MIPRC, as has been proposed in past years legislation, or commit to any other opportunities to study passenger rail, NDOT will remain committed to delivering a high-quality, safe and efficient transportation system for the movement of people and goods in Nebraska,” the statement said.
 Workforce, tourism

The ProRail group, which is associated with the Rail Passenger Association, wants the state DOT to update a state rail passenger plan, Anderson said.
He said his group has advocated in the past for a second Amtrak train that would run during daytime hours across Nebraska. ProRail also supports improved bus service between Nebraska cities, including Omaha and Lincoln.
A company that had provided daily bus rides to students between the Omaha and Lincoln campuses of the University of Nebraska at one time was interested in offering the service to a broader audience, Anderson said. He said the idea fizzled during the COVID-19 pandemic and to his knowledge has not been revived.
Lack of convenient public transit options between Omaha and Lincoln, he said, can hinder people such as himself from, for example, testifying on a bill before the Legislature. 
Juarez said better intercity transit opportunities also could help fill labor gaps and encourage more tourism and entertainment outings between cities. “The potential is massive,” she said.
Organizers of the town halls said they hope to hear voices from urban and rural communities. Virtual participation is an option. Those who want a remote connection are asked to email mjuarez@leg.ne.gov at least two days in advance of the chosen meeting to get a registration link.
An online survey also is ongoing and hosted by Poll The Vote, which plans to provide results to the Nebraska Legislature and the LR 203 interim study.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Ford Motor Company will delay mass production of its next-generation electric pickup truck at its West Tennessee plant until 2028, the company confirmed Thursday.
Ford informed its suppliers of the delay — a result of the company shifting its focus to smaller, more affordable models — in June. The company also pushed back production of its electric transit van at its plant in Ohio from 2026 to 2028.
Prototypes of the truck will still begin production at BlueOval City in Stanton, Tennessee in 2027.
“F-150 Lightning, America’s best-selling electric truck, and E-Transit continue to meet today’s customer needs,” a company spokesperson stated. “We remain focused on delivering our Ford+ plan and will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”
This announcement comes roughly a year after Ford first delayed production of the truck from its initial production goal of 2025 to 2027. At the time, Ford said the decision was part of a shift toward prioritizing hybrid vehicles and producing lower-cost batteries to improve profitability.
Ford announced its $5.6 billion investment in the BlueOval City campus in Haywood County in 2021, pledging to create 5,800 jobs in return for a nearly $1 billion incentive from the state. The Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center where the electric pickup truck will be manufactured plans to employ roughly 3,000 of those workers.
The company has teased a “Model T moment” announcement about its plans to “design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America” at an appearance in Kentucky slated for Aug. 11 at 9:20 a.m. CT.

(Getty photos)West Virginia high school and middle school athletes are now able to get paid for name, image and likeness deals.
The state school board in July approved the first NIL policy for student athletes, and the policy went into effect Friday.
Since the NCAA allowed college athletes to profit from their NIL in 2021, the ripple effects of this change have now affected high school and middle school sports. More than 40 states have laws and state high school association rules governing NIL for young athletes.
North Carolina’s first high school NIL year included a $1.2 million deal for a high school quarterback, Sports Illustrated reported. 
  Wayne Ryan
Wayne Ryan, executive director of the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission, said the state’s new policy sets general guidelines that will protect students from violating their eligibility under amateur athlete rules. 
“It’s basically going to have to be evaluated on a case by case basis,” he said, adding that they pulled from other states’ polices to create a starting point for student athlete NIL in West Virginia. 
“We’re just trying to serve the student athlete appropriately and keep our competitive rules and policy in place,” Ryan added.
The policy put forth by the WVSAAC outlines how students can use their NIL for monetary gain. It bans school employees, including coaches, from being involved in a student athlete’s use of their NIL.
Students are prohibited from making any reference to their school or wearing their school’s logo when engaging in any NIL activity. For example, they couldn’t wear their high school football or cheerleading uniform while participating in a local television commercial. Students also can’t reference the WVSAAC.
“They have to keep it independent of their school and athletic life,’ Ryan said. “Honestly, they have received notoriety for that, but they can’t use that as part of their advertisement.” 
Student athletes also can’t engage in NIL activities to advertise for a number of products, including alcohol, cannabis, weapons, prescription drugs and more. 
  Paul Saluja
Paul Saluja, an attorney in Charleston, visited the state Capitol earlier this year with a successful student athlete and met with state lawmakers about the importance of an NIL policy. He said families don’t want multimillion dollar endorsements; they’re looking for flexibility. He argues that it gives student athletes a reason to stay in West Virginia. 
“Some of these student athletes, they will do well in high school, they’ll do well at the collegiate level, but they’re not going to make it at the pro level,” Saluja said. “This at least allows them the opportunity to go ahead and at least, if not secure their future, but get a good head start on securing their future.”
Ryan said as NIL policies have become standard for states, he had received numerous inquiries from parents outside of West Virginia whose children had NIL deals and were considering relocating to the state. 
Ryan said the policy will continue to be under evaluation “because NIL is an ever fluid ongoing situation.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Ever wished you could open up your mailbox and find $100?
That wish could come true for some Arkansans under a new state unclaimed property law. Act 114 of 2025, which went into effect earlier last week, allows the Arkansas State Auditor to automatically return thousands of dollars of unclaimed money to their owners.
More specifically, the law allows the auditor to mail property valued at less than $5,000 to owners if they live within the state of Arkansas and the auditor “reasonably believes” it belongs to them, even if they haven’t filed a claim for it.
That means unclaimed property could find its way into the inboxes of thousands of Arkansans without requiring them to go through a claims process, State Auditor Dennis Milligan told the Advocate.
“The next two or three months is going to be a lot of fun for Arkansans, because the checks will start going out,” Milligan said. One in four Arkansans have money sitting in the unclaimed property program, he said.
In addition to its other roles, the auditor’s office is responsible for around $400 million in unclaimed property from around the state, which is held in “perpetuity” until it’s claimed, Milligan said.
With the new law, Milligan said his office anticipates sending out nearly a fourth of that — $83 million — to approximately 360,000 people. Milligan said the average payout is expected to be a little over $100.
“This program is very, very important to me,” Milligan said. “You know, $200 might not mean anything to one person, but it may mean the difference between being able to pay a utility bill or … put[ting] some food on the table.”
Milligan’s office receives money from a variety of sources, including abandoned checking accounts, rebates and insurance adjustments.
“I got 20 bucks here a while back off of some kind of rebate,” Milligan said. “A former employer tried to send you your last check, and they couldn’t find you, so they forwarded it to us. It’s a multitude of different reasons why we get sent this money.”
Unclaimed property is more than money. The office keeps a book with pictures of some of the more interesting physical property in its care  — a World War II-era telegram referencing a conversation with Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a $10,000 bill, signed Nolan Ryan baseball cards  — obtained from abandoned safety deposit boxes or an inheritance that went unclaimed. That property is meticulously catalogued and stored.
Getting Arkansans to come and collect what they’re owed, however, can be a difficult task, Milligan said, because many people don’t know they’re owed money at all. Fears about being scammed have also come up.
In some cases, property can go unclaimed for decades. Most people don’t know that the unclaimed property program exists, Milligan said, something that still “amazes” him.
Even Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has unclaimed property, according to the auditor’s office’s online database, where Arkansans can go to see if they are owed money.

Milligan and his staff criss-cross the state to raise awareness for unclaimed property — and to get people to see if they have any in their name. Milligan has personally driven to the homes of people who were owed large sums to convince them to fill out the claims form.
Even for those who weren’t suspicious or knew they were owed money, the paperwork sometimes stood in the way of returning their property, Milligan said. Prior to Act 114, if someone wanted to reclaim property from the auditor’s office, regardless of the value, they had to fill out a form and verify their identity before being sent their property.
Republican Sen. Dave Wallace of Leachville, who introduced the act, said Milligan came to him with the idea for the legislation last year. Automatically repatriating the funds in the possession of the state to their rightful owners, Wallace said, was just good government.
Wallace said he was a “good example” of the benefits of the law  because “the state has $238 that belongs to either me, or my wife, Karen, from some event a couple years ago. I didn’t even know about it. And there’s going to be thousands and tens of thousands of Arkansans in that same situation.”
Milligan said his office will use software to validate the identities and addresses of unclaimed property owners before mailing a check. Getting through the backlog will take time, he said, but eligible unclaimed property owners will begin receiving letters informing them that a check is on the way in the coming months. The check will follow a few weeks after as long as the original letter isn’t returned as undeliverable.
“I mean, who can argue about Arkansans getting their money back?” Milligan said. “I haven’t had anybody complain yet.”
Even with the law, Milligan said he still encourages Arkansans to check the unclaimed property database occasionally. The new law only allows the auditor’s office to send money, and only if it’s $5,000 or less. Any more than that, and the person owed the money still has to fill out the paperwork that was previously required.
Physical property isn’t eligible for automatic repatriation either, nor is property that multiple people or businesses have claims to. For example, if someone is owed money as part of an inheritance that has multiple claimants, they still have to fill out the auditor’s form online.

The survey — for which results were shared with Mississippi Today before publication — of nearly 1,600 Mississippi college students shows that almost 60% of students who reported gambling in the last year said they placed online bets on “legal” sportsbooks. 
This indicates that a potentially large number of students are finding ways to place bets on legitimate platforms, not just illicit betting sites, even though mobile sports betting remains illegal in Mississippi, according to one of the study’s coauthors.    
“Our students are showing similar patterns to those identified by the NCAA and seen nationally, including that legality doesn’t make a difference with college students,” said Dan Durkin, an associate professor of social work.
The survey did not ask about the use of illicit betting platforms because most students either don’t know or don’t care whether or not the practice is illegal, Durkin said. The researchers plan to create a variable before publication that reflects illegality, he added.  
College campuses have become hubs of activity for sports betting and, increasingly, gambling addiction. This has prompted calls for research into mobile sports betting’s growth and impact on young adults. 
As more states began to legalize online betting and concern over addition grew, the NCAA  surveyed students and found that many young adults were wagering on sports despite age, geographic and legal restrictions on betting. 
Mobile sports betting statewide has remained illegal in Mississippi, largely due to fears that legalization could harm the bottom line of the state’s casinos and increase gambling addiction. In 2024, illegal online betting in Mississippi made up about 5% of the national illegal market, which is about $3 billion in illegal bets in Mississippi, proponents said that year. 
The new University of Mississippi study, conducted by Durkin, Hannah Allen, Nicholas McAfee, George McClellan and Ronald Rychlak in conjunction with the University of Mississippi’s William Magee Institute for Student Wellbeing, also found that 32% of students reported using family members or friends to place bets over the past year. About 18% reported placing bets in person at casinos, 15% bet online through a sportsbook outside the U.S. or Canada and another 15% place bets with illegal bookies. 
Mississippi residents have placed, according to some analysts, billions of dollars in online sports bets through illicit offshore betting platforms. But the new survey results show that young people in Mississippi have found a way to place online bets on legitimate platforms as well. They might be doing this by using tools such as virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access betting sites.

Some students told Durkin that their peers learned how to use VPNs after Mississippi enacted a law in 2023 requiring age verification for pornographic sites, prompting some pornography companies to block access to their sites in the state. 
There are just under 80,000 students enrolled at Mississippi’s eight public universities and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. That translates to somewhere between 4,700 and 6,400 Mississippi students facing serious gambling issues currently, Durkin said, using a range of state and national estimates on gambling-related “harm.” This can include psychological distress, debt, and dips in academic performance. 
Of those, 20%–30% may eventually develop a gambling disorder, though gambling disorders can often take time to develop, Durkin said. Those are his estimates, not figures included in the survey.
In the survey, a majority of students who bet on sports had no or a low risk for “problem gambling,” but 10% had a moderate risk for problem gambling, and 6% met criteria for problem gambling.       
The survey looked at gambling across the board. About 39% of students gambled in the past year, with lottery (18%), card games (17%), and sports betting (16%) as the most prevalent types of gambling. Gambling was more prevalent among students who were male, white, lived off campus, participated in athletics, were involved in Greek life and had higher GPAs, the survey found.

Zooming in on sports betting, the most prevalent way to bet was online through a sportsbook. 
The most common sports to bet on were the NFL football (62%), college football (53%), college men’s basketball (48%), and NBA basketball (46%). Typical monthly spending ranged from $0-$6,000, with an average of about $100 per month. 
Favorable regulatory and technological shifts have led to rapid growth for the U.S. online gambling market in recent years. But the industry continues to be undercut by illegal operators. Online gross gaming revenue in the U.S. topped $90 billion in 2024, $67 billion of which went to unlicensed players, according to research commissioned by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, a group that lobbies against illegal gambling.
Changing state regulations have kicked off a lobbying blitz in states such as Mississippi. 
The Mississippi House in 2023, 2024 and 2025 passed legislation legalizing online betting, but it has died in the Senate.
Some form of sports betting is legal in 40 states, though only 20 have full online betting with multiple operators, according to Action Network, a sports betting application and news site. Some states have only in-person betting, and some only have a single online operator. Mississippi permits sports betting, but it only allows bets made in person at casinos or bets made with apps on mobile devices while inside casinos. 
Mississippi House Speaker Jason White, a Republican, has been one of the state’s most vocal proponents of mobile sports betting. He has indicated that his caucus will again push to legalize online betting during the 2026 legislative session.
Durkin said if Mississippi does legalize online betting, the legislation should include funding for addiction treatment paid for with a tax on gambling companies. Several states, such as Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, allocate tax revenues collected through gambling to addiction resources.  
“They should consider modelling our state after what other states have done and include in their legislation money to attend to these problems,” Durkin said. “They need to tax the people who are causing the problems to fund fixing them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08065906/Online-Gaming-2.jpg,,,2025-08-11 06:58:12.367055

(John Gray/Verite News)In late July, officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided access to three detention centers they operate in Louisiana to a group of about 20 civil rights advocates. 
Their tour included the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, located on the former England Air Force Base in Alexandria. It’s become a conduit for individuals apprehended around the country to the nine ICE detention centers in Louisiana, where immigration court watchers say judges are more likely to be aligned to the Trump administration’s enforcement policy.
The other ICE facilities on the tour were the South Louisiana Processing Center in Basile, which holds only women, and the Pine Prairie Processing Center in Evangeline Parish.
The Illuminator conducted two separate interviews with attorneys who went on the tour, and excerpts from these transcripts are shared below. They have been edited for length and clarity. 
One interview featured Kerry Kennedy and Anthony Enriquez with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization, who are in Episode 17 of “The Light Switch,” our weekly podcast.

﻿ 
The other interview is with Alanah Odoms, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, and Nora Ahmed, the organization’s legal director. 
RFK Human Rights and the ACLU of Louisiana have collaborated in the past, most notably as of late on a 2024 report – “Inside the Black Hole” – that detailed “abused and disappeared” immigrants in the state. It was compiled based on interviews with more than 6,000 interviews and seven tours with officials from the New Orleans ICE office. 
Last month’s tour was just the latest trip to the state’s ICE facilities for Ahmed and Enriquez, both of whom have clients in custody. 
The interviews included claims of unsanitary living conditions, inadequate medical care and abuse. Questions about these allegations were sent to the ICE media relations office, and its representatives have yet to respond.

Q: You’ve visited these facilities before. Did you get the sense that preparations were made in advance to have each facility put its best foot forward, or was it much as you’ve seen on past visits?
Odoms: This was actually my first time inside immigrant detention.  … I was really surprised that it did not seem like much preparation went into making things appear, at least visually, better than what they normally are. I think where the real dog and pony show took place was in their presentation to us about their operations and their standards and their protocols. That was like night and day, hearing from ICE about how they care for people and what their standards are, versus hearing directly from the residents.
Q: The first stop on the tour was the ICE Processing Center in Alexandria. Take us through your first impressions.
Odoms: First of all, every single one of these places has many layers of barbed wire around it, so they depict prison immediately. Then you’re brought through metal detectors and security. You’re you have to surrender everything, even a smart watch. You’re not allowed to have any recording devices, anything like that. Then you’re brought through these metal sally port doors, which are these huge metal doors that slam shut behind you, and you are very, very aware that you are in a prison. 
Then you walk in and you see there are two main areas in the staging facility where people are either held in prison, like cells, like a cell block, very traditional prison … and it opens up into  what they call airport-style seating area, where people are actually sitting, chained at their hands, chained at their feet, and chained at their bellies, waiting for their planes to take off. 
That is what you see as soon as you walk in, and they did not try to hide the people who were waiting. There were about maybe a handful, if not maybe 10 to 12 people who were waiting for a flight, who were sitting clearly chained … at every single appendage of their body. 
The second room is more of a gymnasium style room where there are between 70 to 90 people being housed in bunk beds. … This aging facility is where the male population is held inside these either cell blocks or bunk-style barracks. 
In the open room, there’s a large Plexiglas or glass partition where you can very clearly see who’s inside, and they can very clearly see you. As soon as folks saw us, they immediately came to that window. And honestly, the looks on all of their faces were like, “Help.”

Q: Kerry, your organization has a global focus on human rights concerns. What’s happening in Louisiana’s ICE facilities that has made this situation one of your priorities?
  Kerry Kennedy, president of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization. (RFK Human Rights photo)
Kennedy: When we were in Louisiana, in the detention centers, we met with a woman who is also one of our clients, who her doctor told her that she might have colon cancer, and she was picked up [to see a doctor] a couple of days later. She’s been asking for four and a half months to see a doctor to see whether or not she has colon cancer, and her ability to see that doctor has been denied for four and a half months. 
We met another woman, an elderly woman, who begged and pleaded to see a doctor because she came into the facility walking perfectly, and now she’s forced to use a wheelchair, and she doesn’t know why. She’s begged and pleaded to see a doctor. They finally said, ”We’ll send you to health care,” and she was sexually assaulted when she did that. 
I met another young woman who’s 26 years old. She is gay. She’s from Russia. She fled Russia because of the oppression against gay people, because her life was in danger. She’s got a master’s in chemical engineering, and she was working for a pharmaceutical company, making medicines for us, for our country, and now instead, she’s in this detention center. 
This makes no sense. These are people who are in our communities, who are creating change, who are paying taxes, who are making our country stronger and better. And instead, now you and I … [are] paying through our tax dollars for their breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day, and for them to be in a prison situation instead about the world creating change. So that’s why we’re attacking this.
Q: How do you mount a legal strategy for your clients against an administration that is willing to subvert due process when it comes to immigration law?
Enriquez: This is a question that actually has two answers. One is we work hand in hand with people who are living and working in the communities where detention centers exist. So for those of you who are in Louisiana, one thing that’s been interesting is when we have discussions with the workers who are guards in some of these private prisons, these detention centers. They tell us, “I really didn’t have another choice. It was either work here or in a casino, and this was the only thing around for me. This was a way that I could feed my own family.” 
So a core element of what we’re doing is to try and extend the notion of human rights, not just to the people who are suffering the types of physical sexual abuse that that you just heard Kerry speak of the detained immigrants, but actually the workers who are being exploited in these detention centers as well by private prison.
CEOs … are pocketing these taxpayer dollars for their own bonuses. People might not be aware that the head of the corporate leadership of the GEO Group, which is one of the owners of many of the detention centers in Louisiana, they just gave themselves big fat raises after the passage of this last domestic policy bill. That’s money that they’re actually taking out of the hands of pockets of Louisiana workers as well. So that’s one of the ways that we really try and broaden the conception of what human rights is, and we let people know this is a big fight that’s affecting all of us. 
Q: Statistics show that roughly half of the people being detained in Louisiana ICE facilities do not have a prior criminal background, and many have not been formally charged with a crime.
Odoms: The only designation that they have that separates people who they believe have criminal histories is this high- [or] low-designation, and whether you get put in a cell block or whether you get put in the barrack style living conditions. 
When we asked about classification for how people were classified as either high or low, we didn’t get a very clear answer on that at all. Sometimes they were saying, “Well, they come to us that way from other facilities, so someone else is making the classification, and we’re just kind of rubber stamping that and either putting somebody in a cell block or putting someone in a barracks.” Or, “We have a point system,” and they said, “Oh, you’re going to have to request that in writing.” 
So anytime we kind of brushed up against a question that would really illuminate what was happening in terms of constitutional violations and real problems, all of those questions were met with: “That would have to be something that you submit in writing.”
Q: What explanations have you been given as to why your clients are being warehoused indefinitely in ICE detention without any opportunity for bond, and what level of proof is the federal government providing to justify this?
Ahmed: We have two clients [and] we’ll be filing habeas petitions* in short order that illustrate this. 
One of our clients, they’ve attempted to remove her to six different countries. All have said no, but she’s still there because apparently they’re just going to run through the list, which is … wildly preposterous. 

* What is a habeas petition? It’s a legal filing with the court to require authorities to present the legal reason someone is held in prison.

In terms of bond, we’re going to bring another habeas challenge. Because right now you’ve probably heard the administration is [taking into custody] people who appear at their immigration proceedings. We have a client who appeared for her asylum proceeding, and then she was whisked away. The reason she was whisked away is because of a newfound interpretation of the United States Code, Section 1225, which no longer is interpreting mandatory detention as applicable to people appearing at the border, and is now just applying to anybody who entered the country without inspection. 
So you’re now starting to see people like our client, who’ve been in the United States for two decades, showing up as they’re supposed to to an immigration court hearing. Are you really a flight risk if you’re showing up to your court hearing? Probably not. And in her particular case, there’s no criminal record. So you’re also talking about somebody who there is no conceivable way that you could possibly say that she’s a danger. 
I still want to say that people who do have criminal records are also not dangerous, let’s be clear, because in this country, a criminal record could include not paying a fine or having to pick up your child and not making a court date. So I don’t like to pitch people with criminal records as people who are dangerous because the vast majority are not.

Q: Recently in Louisiana, two powerful members of our congressional delegation intervened to secure the release of two detainees. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise stepped in to have an Iranian woman who’s lived in New Orleans for nearly 50 years released, and Sen. John Kennedy was instrumental in the release of a Mexican woman who’s married to a U.S. Marine. Does this give you any glimmer of hope that other powerful Republicans will call for the Trump administration to pause its sweeping immigration enforcement efforts?
Kennedy: I think it’s important that people at the highest levels are beginning to understand the impact of these terrible laws. You know, one of the problems with GEO Group is that it runs prisons. So this is a detention facility that is run as a prison. 
But before this, we were not always putting people in detention, and a lot of these people have been in the communities, have been in the Marines, have served our country. They are our teachers. They are giving us the food that we eat every day. They’re making our medicines.
They can be in the community, and they’re great programs – proven again and again and again – where 100% of the people who are released into the community return for their detention here, for their immigration hearings and also to be deported, if that’s ultimately what’s supposed to happen to them. 
So why in the world are we taking people? Why are we kidnapping people off the street and treating them with such inhumanity and harming our country at the same time? This makes no sense, unless you think about it as a way to enrich a cruel corporation, which is what’s happened. 
Q: The sheer number of people being detained makes it close to impossible that everyone is represented by an attorney. Is there any solution within sight that, at the very least, would ensure every detainee receives legal representation?
Kennedy: Yeah, well, there’s a clear solution – open up the doors and let people be in the community, which was the solution under the Bush administration, the Obama administration, many of the other administrations. That’s what would happen to people, and there are proven programs where 100% of them come back to their [immigration court] hearing. So that’s the least expensive, most effective and best way to assure that people’s rights are not being compromised by the United States government.   
Q: We’re seeing increasing incidents of people showing up for immigration court hearings at the appointed time and date, following official instructions only to be taken into ICE custody and placed into detention. How are you advising clients who might want to adhere to the rules but face a good chance they will be apprehended and then fast-tracked toward deportation or imprisoned indefinitely?     
Odoms:  We have very direct guidance for people who are able to obtain counsel. They absolutely need to do so, and they need to presume that they are going to be apprehended. Like, it’s not if they’re going to be taken. It’s when they’re going to be taken. 
But here’s the thing, I really want this to come across: Everyone is still having faith in this system, that if they actually present themselves and continue to do what’s right, being compliant, being adherent, that they will actually be given some kind of consideration. And that is not true
Ahmed: … What preparations people need to do? They need to prepare in two to three very distinct ways, I think, and we can tell them, talk to an immigration attorney about a motion to reopen your immigration proceedings very quickly. Also try to ensure that you have access to a federal practitioner who will be able to file a habeas petition for you when you’re incarcerated. 
… We’ve seen a lot of congressional folks start stepping up, have a privacy waiver signed and make sure that everyone important in your life, including your congressional representatives, is able to communicate on your behalf with ICE. You can download the document off of the [ICE] website. … You get to fill in the information of whoever is allowed to have access, and then they can start advocating for you with ICE. You should know your congressional representatives, who can do that, your local friends and family.
Q: Alana, your organization has always had as its bedrock the belief that our Constitution, our laws and judicial system ultimately would not let us down. Do you feel that certainty still exists?
Odoms: Yeah, it does feel like the safety net of our Constitution has started to fray in some really fundamental ways. 
… Myself and every other lawyer that’s been trained in this country, we’re trained in the Constitution, both of Louisiana and of the United States of America. We’re not trained to actually respond to an authoritarian regime – that is the true issue that we’re all facing. What do you do when the Constitution doesn’t apply anymore? What do we do when we actually have laws and those laws are being completely thrown out, how do we respond? 
There’s a lot for us to learn from organizers and folks who have been doing work outside of the power structure, because I don’t think we’re going to find our answers in the traditional way that we have in the past.
…  That’s the outside strategy that we have to work on. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with filing a lawsuit, but it does have to do with strategizing around people power. How do we do that? Because these systems are only going to buckle under the the pressure of people saying, “Oh, hell no, that looks like an authoritarian regime. That’s not what we want. We want a process. We want due process. We want people to have access to lawyers. We want people to have access to all the things that our constitution says.” 
That’s a people power movement.

At some point, most will be released.
The question for crime victims, people behind bars and the families of both is when.
How that question gets answered is at the heart of a working group created by Gov. Mike Kehoe earlier this year to examine Missouri’s parole system to bring “clarity, transparency and accountability” to the process. 
The deadline for the 15-member panel to complete its work is Oct. 1.
At the panel’s one and only public hearing June 13, Tony Helfrecht, the chairman of the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole, called the panel a “once-in-a-decade opportunity” that would overhaul supervision for paroled people with increased accountability “with the goal of safeguarding public safety while promoting successful reintegration, reintroduction and reducing recidivism.” 
Missouri math: How a 23-year sentence adds up to more than 40 years in prison

Helfrecht, who is leading the working group, and department Director Trevor Foley, who is vice-chair, declined a request for interviews until the report is complete. Six other members are corrections department employees or members of the state parole board, and five represent the judiciary and law enforcement. 
Only two members were previously incarcerated. 
Prisoner advocates worry the working group is stacked with Department of Corrections employees and law enforcement, and that will result in stricter rules and delayed releases.
“I have some serious concerns that the intent of the governor’s order is not going to be met and that this is going to be lip service when it’s such a wonderful opportunity to bring clarity to a process that provides release to so many people in Missouri,” said Amy Malinowski, co-director of the Missouri office of the MacArthur Justice Center, a non-profit that advocates on behalf of people involved in the criminal justice system. 
One area advocates hope the group addresses is the parole board’s reinterpretation of the minimum time that must be served for some offenses. While state statute sets some minimums, such as for repeat offenders or particularly heinous crimes, the board has wide latitude in state law to set percentages of time for particular levels of crime, or to change them by rule or policy decisions.
The Division of Probation and Parole is part of the state corrections department but independent in many ways. It was sued in 2019 for the new way it has applied a policy — in place since 1985 — that incarcerated people must serve at least 15 years on any life sentence that is eligible for parole.
The change that prompted the ultimately unsuccessful court challenges pushed the parole dates for hundreds of incarcerated Missourians years — in some cases a decade — into the future. 
Kent Gipson, a Kansas City attorney who represents several incarcerated people in appeals, said the change was unnecessary.
“If a guy’s shown he’s a worthy candidate for parole and he’s done 28 years, and he’s 50, or however old he probably is, what’s the point in keeping him another 15 years?” said Kent Gipson, Dunn’s attorney. “It’s stupid.”
The 2019 change was a topic of discussion at the working group’s brief June 13 public hearing, where only three people testified during the 25 minutes  meeting. In addition to the questions about how eligibility is calculated, issues identified in testimony are:

Boilerplate language on forms delivering parole board decisions that give no details on the reasons for denials.
Lengthy delays between parole being granted at a hearing and the actual release. Current rules allow the hearings to be held four months prior to potential release, but until recently, those hearings were up to two years in advance of release.
Unwillingness of the parole board to use its discretion to convert consecutive sentences to concurrent sentences in eligible cases.

“When we give people a chance to reunite with their families and communities in a timely manner, we reinforce public safety,” Clifton Davis of the Missouri Justice Coalition told the working group. “We do not weaken it.”
There will be no more public hearings because the working group is under a tight deadline, Pojmann said. Instead, she said, written comments are being accepted.
 Boilerplate language

When a person in a Missouri prison has a parole hearing, the board’s decision is delivered on a one-page form.
There are eight lines where an X indicates the decision, whether it is to deny and reschedule, set a release date or other action. At the bottom, there are 12 lines where reasons for the decision are given.
Many times, when parole is denied, the only reason provided is that “release at this time would depreciate the seriousness of the present offense…” 
The parole board should give more details, especially to tell the incarcerated person what they should do to mitigate the concerns listed, said Courtney Everett, coordinator of the St. Louis University Prison Education Program.
 This form, given to incarcerated people in the Missouri Department of Corrections after a parole hearing (screenshot).
Everett, along with Stacey Lannert, founder of Healing Sisters, is one of the two working group members who have served time in a Missouri prison. He was sentenced to 22 years for assault in 2004 and was released in 2021. 
When time came for his parole hearing, he said it seemed formulaic. He was approaching his conditional release date, when he had to be released barring a reason to deny it.
“They really didn’t ask me questions,” he said. “It was like, ‘Where are you going, who are you going to live with?’ It was like 10 minutes. I didn’t say anything. But at the same time, these are the people who control whether a person is being released from prison. And sometimes you don’t know what they’re thinking.”
When denying parole, Malinowski said, the board should be required to give concrete, detailed reasons.
“The board should be required to explain the basis for their decision, cite the evidence they relied upon, and then explain what that person can do to better prepare themselves for release,” she said. “It’s not individualized other than the offender’s name and number changing on the form.”
The working group should mandate the change, Davis told them at the hearing.
“When individuals meet all conditions and have clear plans for success, they deserve more than a form letter,” he said. “They deserve a response that recognizes who they are.”
 Parole particulars

How much time any person eligible for parole spends behind bars is determined in part by the classification of their offense in statute, as well their history of felony sentences. The harshest punishment, and the only one where no release is possible, is for first-degree murder.
Determining an individual’s earliest parole date is a calculation based partly in statute and partly in regulation. Basic eligibility is determined by the rules.
The minimum wait for parole eligibility is 15% of a sentence for the lowest-level felonies. 
The percentage escalates as the classification of felony goes up the scale. For any felony that is a sexual or violent offense, or involves abuse of a child, regardless of classification, regulations require 33% of the sentence be served before parole eligibility.
Statutes set minimum time before parole eligibility for anyone previously placed in the custody of the department. That can be up to 80% of their sentence, depending on the number of previous terms in prison. 
There are 25 offenses where the person sentenced to prison must serve 85% of their time before what is called conditional release. All prisoners have a conditional release period of up to five years at the end of their sentence where they are supervised until their term is completed.

The parole board does have some discretion, though advocates say it rarely exercises that discretion. It’s a scenario the working group was urged to address in its report to the governor. 
One area in particular that was highlighted to the working group is the board’s ability to convert consecutive life without parole sentences for crimes committed by juveniles into concurrent sentences.
Missouri law allows the parole board to consider paroling people who committed offenses with long terms as juveniles when they have served 15 years. But the board rarely uses its discretion,  Davis said.
“This isn’t about giving people a free pass,” he said. “It’s about recognizing that the law has already provided a mechanism to evaluate whether continuing consecutive time still serves the purpose of justice.”
The board also rarely uses its power to grant medical paroles for people near the end of their lives.
The MacArthur Justice Center sued the department to secure the release of Walter Hunter, who was serving multiple life sentences and was dying of liver cancer. The effort was unsuccessful and he died in 2017 at the South Central Correctional Center in Licking.
“I remember visiting with him, and he was in a wheelchair and was jaundiced and very swollen belly,” Malinowski said in an interview with The Independent. “And I got to know his sister very well, and all that he wanted was to be able to die with her.”
 Transparency

The working group is limited in what it can do because its directive is to examine the regulations governing the parole process, Pojmann said, not sentencing statutes or any other law.
But there are steps that could increase transparency and assure the public that each case is being considered on its merits, Malinowski said.
“They’re just too closed to provide any sort of comfort to the public that they’re doing their job well, making reasonable and evidence-based decisions and giving people a fair shot,” Malinowski said.
Some states televise their parole hearings, Everett said. That helps maintain a serious attitude and brings clarity to the individual issues the board must consider.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to a more transparent system is the anonymity the current process gives to decision-makers, he said.
“A lot of times, they’re looking for reasons to keep people incarcerated, to protect their own interest, their own conscience, or, sometimes, to protect their own careers.” Everett said. “Because if you’re the public official that lets somebody out of prison, you’re less likely to get voted in.”
One goal, Boone County Circuit Judge Brouck Jacobs, a member of the working group, said in an interview with The Independent, should be more certainty for crime victims, defendants and the public when a sentence is handed down.
Only someone familiar with the rules and laws governing parole would be able to estimate how factors such as the severity of the crime, the person’s history of incarceration and the age of the offender determine a release date. It should be clear to everyone in the courtroom what a sentence means, Jacobs said. 
“They think somebody’s got seven years for breaking into their home, a burglary,” Jacobs said, “and then I think they’re shocked and chagrined when the person’s out in a year-and-a-half.”

(KCTCS photo) About two-thirds of Kentucky community college students surveyed last year say they have experienced depression or anxiety while 1 in 5 reported engaging in “self-injurious behavior.”
In response, the Kentucky Community and Technical College System is launching a Mental Health Strategy for its roughly 100,000 students.
KCTCS President Ryan Quarles told the Lantern that since taking on his role in 2023, he’s sought to prioritize mental health.
“We know that …. half of all community college students across the country struggle with mental health issues, and the report that we see here clearly shows that Kentucky is higher than national averages,” he said. “So, we still have to learn from other states, but the need is very severe right now.” 
  Ryan Quarles (KCTCS photo)
The largest provider of postsecondary education in the state, KCTCS will educate employees and students about mental health, create a centralized document full of mental health resources for the whole system, develop a peer wellness program in which students can volunteer as mental health ambassadors for those around them, provide staff with trainings on how to spot depression and anxiety in their students and more. 
This comes in response to a 2024 Healthy Minds Study that showed that in the KCTCS system, 68% of surveyed students had depression and 66% had anxiety. That survey also showed 13% of students who took the survey were at risk of an eating disorder and 20% had already engaged in “self-injurious behavior.” 
“We know that our students are facing (a) heightened degree of mental health issues that, probably, previous generations have not faced or is undiagnosed,” Quarles said. 
Stressors facing students are numerous, he said: financial and housing concerns, food insecurity, upheaval following back-to-back floods in Eastern Kentucky, decimation by tornadoes in West and Western Kentucky and more. 
Mental health challenges already existed prior to the global pandemic that hit Kentucky in 2020, but “COVID peeled the onion peel off to show how big of an issue this is,” Quarles said. 
In 2022 the World Health Organization pointed to “unprecedented stress” during COVID-induced isolation as a key stressor driving worsening mental health. Children who switched to remote schooling also missed social milestones during that time. 
KCTCS plans to apply for grant funding to support the mental health efforts, but for now it comes out of the general budget. It’s too soon to say if the system will ask the General Assembly for project-specific funding in 2026, Quarles said. 
“I do think that our legislators are aware of the mental health issues of our students,” he said, “and I think it’s come to them both from their constituents … but also higher ed in general is talking more about this, deservedly so, across the state.”

Christopher Hetherington, executive director of strategic enrollment management at KCTCS, said more and more college students have faced mental health issues over the last two decades, and research is finally revealing the extent of the problem. 
“You’ve got the social media, you’ve got the constant, 24-hour news cycle,” he said. “You’ve got financial concerns, currently, within higher education.” 
Students also face concerns over where to get enough food — and a large percentage wouldn’t be able to easily get $500 in an emergency, Hetherington said. 
“Now that we have more resources, as far as data is concerned, we have  a more clear calling to do this work than maybe would have been 10, 15, 20 years ago,” he said. 
The Healthy Minds Study 
The Healthy Minds Study, which involved 2,500 students between Feb. 26 to March 18, 2024, presented KCTCS with a call to action: better address students’ mental health needs. 
The study showed, among other things: 

86% of respondents described their financial situation as stressful.
40% reported having moderate to severe depression with another 27% at mild. 
38% reported having moderate to severe anxiety, with another 29% at mild. 
29% of respondents felt isolated from others often, and another 36% felt that way some of the time.
72% reported that in the four weeks before being surveyed, they experienced some level of academic impairment caused by their emotional or mental difficulties. 
Among students screening positive for anxiety or depression, 27% received therapy.
23% of respondents reported that in the 12 months prior to being surveyed, they were worried about not having stable housing.
15% of respondents reported worrying about losing their steady place to live in the future and 2% reported not having a steady place to live at all.
45% of respondents were worried about not having enough food in the past year.

Quarles said this data demonstrates “a serious issue” in Kentucky. 
“I think that we always knew that mental health was an issue in America, but I think that during and post COVID, it only revealed how big of a crisis it is,” he said. “And it’s not just unique to higher ed. It’s in K-12. It’s in workplace environments. It’s in adult populations. We know that this is a national crisis right now.” 
Investments in mental health, Quarles said, should be viewed on the same level as any other type of student support. Prioritizing that, he said, will help students succeed in the long run. 
“A healthier society is going to create a healthier economy as well, meaning that students will be better prepared to finish their degree, finish their certificate and be more prepared to enter the job market and be able to fulfill the expectations that an employer may have,” he said. “And that, ultimately, increases the economic prosperity of the state as well.”
‘Nursing school is really hard:’ the pressures of being a student

Charlotte Boyd, who attended Jefferson Community and Technical College from 2019 to 2022 before transferring to Spalding University, believes such a mental health initiative would have helped her. 
Boyd, who studied nursing, suffered panic attacks, found virtual learning during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic to be “frustrating” and didn’t feel properly supported during an intensely stressful time of her life. 
“Nursing school is really hard,” she said. “I’m not an anxious person in general, but I had to have a pretty full cardiac workup when I was at JCTC in the nursing program to make sure I wasn’t having cardiac issues. And I wasn’t. I was having … panic attacks. It was really, really horrible.” 
Boyd is now working as a labor and delivery nurse at Norton Healthcare in Louisville.  
Wendy Johnson, who attended Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College from 2006–2009 for respiratory therapy, faced mild stressors during her time as a student. She was the first person in her family to go to college and was often the oldest person in her classes, having started at age 31. That was “a little bit stressful,” she said. She also had two children, 11 and 7 years old. 
Johnson, who lives in Scottsville and now works across the border in Tennessee, looked at school differently than some of her peers. She was a dental assistant and originally wanted to study dental hygiene. 
“‘You’re going to give yourself a raise right here, and you’re going to have a good career,’” she told herself. Because she started school with children, studying was difficult at times. 
“I would have to stay up late or … try to do things before the kids got home from school,” she recalled. 
Still, she managed to earn a 4.0 grade point average and received an excellence award.
“At 18 years old,’ she said, “I don’t feel like I would have done as well.”

‘Get it right.’ 
KCTCS plans to do more surveys of students and monitor what works to improve mental health, Hetherington said. 
In community college, there’s also a smaller window to help than at four-year universities, he said. “Our students are gone in a year or two.” 
Each  of the system’s 16 colleges will also have freedom to customize its mental health approach since each campus population will have different needs. 
“We’re very aware that … there tends to be more reluctance in rural areas for people to talk about mental health,” Quarles said. “We also know that perhaps in the more urban areas, there may be more resources or organizations addressing mental health as well. And so there’s going to be some nuances across the state, and this is also an opportunity for us to learn from each other.” 
At the spring graduation ceremonies, KCTCS colleges awarded around 10,546 associate degrees, 1,716 diplomas and 31,062 certificates. 
“We’re the entry point for the vast majority of Kentuckians starting college, and so it’s very important for us to address mental health needs of our students, because for a lot of our students, if they don’t have a good experience with us, they may never make it to that four-year university, or may never get that skill or trade to get a job,” Quarles said. “So it’s important for us to get it right.”

Carefully assess the actions of Missouri’s governor, Republican members of the state legislature and our Congressional delegation. Then ask yourself: Whose priorities, interests and concerns have they supported, fought for and voted for?


Certainly not those of most Missourians.


Missourians voted for candidates in various elective offices to represent and fight for their interests in Jefferson City and Washington, D.C.


Instead, many of the Republican elected officials seem to have forgotten and folded to the pressure of supporting and carrying out the agenda of the Trump administration, whether it is in the best interest and well-being of Missouri citizens or not.


Look at the behavior of Missouri senators and representatives in Congress. While some bothered to proclaim that Medicaid should not be cut, at the end of the posturing they all went along with approving the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”


Essentially voting for the cuts in Medicaid funding that will deny tens of thousands of Missourians life-saving services. How many rural hospitals will be affected or forced to close in the coming months and years because of these cuts?


Their actions, or failures to act, are disturbing and disconcerting.


How is it that members of the Missouri congressional delegation can get away with the abdication of carrying out their governance and oversight responsibilities?


When it comes to allowing the Trump administration to usurp Congress’s power and arbitrarily disrupt, disband and defund departments that will negatively impact Missourians. First it was the department of education that was the target, cutting needed funding for school districts.


The most recent is the proposal to decentralize the department of agriculture. Will these changes hurt Missouri farmers, causing them to lose necessary funding and programmatic support? What are the positions of members of the Missouri Congressional delegation?


Our representatives in Congress have been silent and given tacit support to other actions of the Trump administration.


When it comes to the impact of increased tariffs on farmers being able to export their soybeans and other produce, and the higher cost of consumer goods across the board for families already struggling to make ends meet.


When it comes to immigration tactics that disrupt business operations, the workforce in agricultural industries and the lives of innocent family members.


When it comes to the short and long-term effects of taxation policies and the national debt, the burden of which Missourians like all Americans must bear.


When there is no oversight, no checks and balanced guardrails, how can we be confident that the policies and decisions being made will be in our best interest?


The actions of our Republican governor, Republican-controlled state legislature and other government offices are in lock-step with the Trump administration as well.


An executive order adopted and ensured the implementation of dismantling DEI programs throughout governmental departments and agencies, colleges and universities, and wherever the state had authority to issue a mandate. Businesses have been sued by the state attorney general for apparent noncompliance.


What measures are being implemented to ensure that all Missourians are treated equal and have equal access and equal opportunity? A state with a diverse population base, who is helped or hurt?


Republican state legislators in the Senate and House wrote letters urging the Missouri U.S. Senators to pass the “Big Beautiful Bill” irrespective of the negative impacts on their constituents.


The latest influence of President Trump on what goes on in Missouri is his request for the legislature to draw a new mapto eliminate one of the two Democratic congressional districts to help ensure that the Republicans maintain the majority in the House after the 2026 midterm elections.


Such a move, if successful, would eliminate the congressional district that represents Kansas City and some adjacent counties, thereby diminishing or negating the impact the representation and vote of a large number of constituents, including large minority groups.


The Republican governor and Republican-dominated legislature are seriously considering calling a special legislative session to make President Trump’s wishes happen.


Congressional districts are usually revisited or redrawn following the U.S. Census taken every 10 years that tracks population shifts and other changes. Redrawing districts mid-cycle or in an off year is solely to provide a political advantage for one party or the other.


Missouri has six Republican and two Democratic Congressional districts.


Every Missourians should think about the meaning of the political move to change that to 7 to 1.


Fundamentally, elected officials, irrespective of their party affiliations, should represent all constituents living within their electoral boundaries despite the racial and ethnic make-up or how they may have voted.


Likewise, representative government means just that. It should represent, as best as possible, all the people it governs.


As there is growing disapproval of President Trump and many of his policies by most recent polls, why are Republican state leaders continuing to bow to the pressure of jumping on an increasingly unpopular Trump agenda?


It behooves each of us to ask a critical question.


Who, among our state Republican elected officials, is standing steadfast to promote, protect and put the priorities of Missourians first amid this national political morass?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/donaldtrumpfeb112025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Public school enrollment continues to fall

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo provided by Humanities North Dakota)North Dakota Humanities says its financial future looks more stable after a federal judge indicated the executive branch was wrong to cancel two years of nationwide humanities grants.
The National Endowment for the Humanities was created by Congress in 1965 to support civics, arts and cultural education across the country. A total of 56 humanities councils, including Humanities North Dakota, rely on the agency for money.
Those humanities councils were dealt a significant blow after the federal government in early April walked back hundreds of millions in grant funding earmarked for them by Congress for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, according to court records. The National Endowment for the Humanities at the time said it was “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”
North Dakota Humanities in April said it stood to lose $600,000 in grant money it received for fiscal year 2024 because of the funding cuts. The organization later received $300,000 in private donations to keep its doors open, though it said it still would have to pare down its programming in light of the grant cancellation.
Humanities North Dakota in limbo after loss of federal funding

Oregon U.S. District Judge Michael Simon in a Wednesday order wrote that the executive branch’s decision to defund humanities councils is unlawful and will likely be overturned at a later date. Simon’s order doesn’t reinstate any of the grant money, but it does temporarily prevent the federal government from spending it elsewhere, according to the Federation of State Humanities Councils. 
“With the court’s decision, we’ll begin the process of resuming paused initiatives, reconnecting with community partners, and making responsible financial decisions that reflect both the uncertainty of the past few months and our long-term commitments,” said Brenna Gerhardt, executive director of Humanities North Dakota.
The grant cancellations were one of the many program purges carried out by executive branch agencies at the request of the Department of Government Efficiency. In addition to the funding cuts, the National Endowment for the Humanities this spring laid off roughly 65% of its staff, according to Simon’s order.
Simon’s decision came in a lawsuit against the Department of Government Efficiency and the National Endowment for the Humanities brought by the Federation of State Humanities Councils and one of its members, Oregon Humanities.
In their complaint, the plaintiffs allege the federal government canceled the funding “with no reasoned analysis and with total disregard for the Congressionally mandated role of councils: to ensure that humanities programs reach every part of the United States.”
The National Endowment for the Humanities has said that the grants were pulled because they were identified as promoting subjects like diversity, equity and inclusion, disability accommodation and environmental justice, which President Donald Trump pledged to eliminate in an executive order adopted earlier this year.
Simon said this flies in the face of how Congress wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities to use the grant money. Federal law directs the federal agency to support programs that “reflect the diversity and richness of our American cultural heritage” and “give particular regard to scholars, and educational and cultural institutions, that have traditionally been underrepresented.”
The funding cuts have disrupted funding for causes including an Indigenous language preservation program in Alaska, an end-of-life care department for an Ohio children’s hospital and rural libraries in Oregon, Simon noted in his order.
“From the largest cities to the most rural communities throughout our nation, humanities funding came to a screeching halt,” he wrote.
Phoebe Stein, president of the Federation of State Humanities Councils, in a Wednesday statement applauded Simon’s decision but noted that it still leaves humanities councils underfunded for the time being.
“Many have already laid off staff and canceled vital programs as a result,” Stein said in the announcement.
The National Endowment for the Humanities has argued in court documents that federal regulations allow them to terminate grants at will if they conclude that a grant does not further agency priorities.

President Donald Trump’s phaseout of clean energy tax credits will make solar and wind projects more expensive, but some states are still committed to clean energy mandates. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.




We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.


– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce



“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
Tax credits axed
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
A slower, costlier transition
Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)“Enough is enough,” Jason Woodby said in a crowd of Chesterfield residents at the Department of Environmental Quality’s Aug. 7 informational meeting for a new Dominion Energy gas plant air permit. The utility has said the new plant is necessary to help meet the state’s soaring energy demands. 
Over a hundred community members showed up to the meeting in red shirts to decry the proposed peaker gas plant that Dominion wants to build in their backyard. Their biggest concerns are the cumulative health impacts on the largely low-income and communities of color that surround the plant, which they say have already been breathing in coal dust for decades.
The proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC), at the site of a former coal-fired plant, is only meant to run 37% of the time during peak energy demand hours. It will be able to power up in a matter of minutes to run for several hours at a time to take the strain off the regional PJM power grid during the hottest and coldest days when energy demands skyrocket.

But environmental groups believe that the company should be focusing on renewable energy as mandated by the Virginia Clean Economy Act. In case filings to the State Corporation Commission, they have proposed other ways for the company to meet energy demands, including through solar, wind, and battery storage.
“This plant is dirty and expensive. No two ways about it. Burning methane is bad for our health,” said Rachel James, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “If allowed, this plant would spew out several harmful contaminants, including fine particulate matter, which is one of the most deadly air pollutants.”
 Project background

The 1000-megawatt plant faced some permitting challenges at the original proposed location across the street, prompting Dominion to move it to the Chesterfield Power Station, just north of the Dutch Gap conservation area. The site used to be a coal-fired power station that began to be retired in 2018 and fully ended burning coal in 2023, after burning for over 70 years. The process of removing the ash from the pond on the site is still in progress.
Dominion still facing opposition to natural gas plant proposal after location change

The plant is still operational for gas production through two units that produce about 420 MW of energy. Those portions of the plant are not planned to be part of the peaker usage and will run more than the proposed 37% for the other units.
Dominion officials said this project is critical to meet the exponential growth of power demand – with Virginians expected to be using double the amount of energy they are now by the late 2030s. The CERC will be only used for peak energy demands on the hottest and coldest days of the year, according to Dominion. The plant can be fired up in about 15 minutes in order to help stabilize the grid on those high-use days, when the company gets the call from PJM that additional support for the grid will be needed.
“Our customers are using 5% more power every year, and by the late 2030s our customers will use twice as much power as they use today,” said Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion spokesperson. “…If we don’t do that, there’s going to be a power gap. Power demand will exceed power supply, and there won’t be enough energy for our customers on those hottest and coldest days of the year.”
 Environmental, health concerns

Since the coal-fired plant fully shut down two years ago, air quality has improved for the surrounding communities, according to DEQ. The CERC facility is projected to have significantly less emissions than the coal plant.
Representatives from DEQ at last week’s community meeting also stated that the proposed gas plant is much more efficient than other facilities around the country. It would not significantly raise air pollution compared to the former coal burning.
However, residents feel that since they just started to see air quality improve, they don’t want to see additional pollutants put into the air.
“It seems like Dominion and now DEQ is using the fact that there was this coal ash plant here, running for 70 years, (as) kind of a cover for introducing even more pollution to the same area.  From a community perspective, the fact that this community has been exposed to 70 years of coal pollution doesn’t justify exposing it to more pollution,” Woodby said.
DEQ uses air monitoring both inside the stacks of the plant and locally to ensure  gas plants are meeting the air quality standards. They use the ambient air monitoring to make their assessments, but community members said the monitors are too far away to get an accurate read on the impact of the Chesterfield location and should be placed on the fenceline of the facility. DEQ officials said the modeling for the plant’s emissions and reads on ambient air show the plant will be within the requirements,
Dominion has been working to meet the state’s renewable energy goals laid out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act, according to the company spokesman. The utility has stated that an estimated six methane gas plants in the state will be needed to meet the growing energy demand, on top of renewable energy, to prevent a grid collapse during hot and cold days.
“We are all in, all in on offshore wind, all in on solar. The one thing you’re dealing with renewables like offshore wind and solar, is that they are intermittent resources,” Slayton said. “So those renewables work hand in hand with natural gas to make sure we are able to meet our customers’ power demand so we can keep the lights on for our customers.”
Advocacy groups have taken to the courts over the county allowing the project to move forward with a conditional use permit from 2010 instead of the project needing to apply for a new one. The county said the location was already permitted to be a plant and additional review was not needed. Residents also took issue with the county not doing a site suitability process for the project, with regulators stating the project meets all local ordinances.
“We have determined that the area will be, unless we got something wrong, data will show that it’s going to be suitable from an air pollution perspective,” said Alison Sinclair, an air permit writer for DEQ. “That’s all we can do from the air pollution perspective…That’s why we look to the counties, because they know where everything is and what’s going on in their county.”
Chesterfield County decides to not take up zoning appeal for Dominion’s natural gas plant

Dominion held their own informational open houses about the project in the community despite not having to go through a conditional use permit process that would have required the county’s Board of Supervisors take a new vote on the zoning for the project. Advocates appealed the Chesterfield county decision to accept the old CUP permit in order to force a new vote by the supervisors, but a judge in July 2024 denied the appeal. Advocates said they would not give up their fight.
Dominion and the proposal’s opponents will present their cases to the SCC on Aug. 19. That panel will be tasked with determining if the energy project is necessary for grid reliability as the company claims and if it is a reasonable cost for ratepayers, who will be on the hook for some of the project funding. 
DEQ has published the draft permit for the facility and has opened the public comment period. An official public hearing will be held on Sept. 8, where the community will have their comments officially recorded and submitted to DEQ before the permit is officially approved or denied. 
If the permit is approved and the SCC gives the green light to move forward, Dominion anticipates construction to begin in 2026 and the plant to come online in 2029.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9938-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs)In a sweeping policy shift that could reshape labor relations at one of the largest federal agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has terminated collective bargaining agreements for most of its unionized workforce, citing a need to better serve veterans and implement long-stalled management reforms.
The decision, announced last week, follows an executive order from former President Donald Trump that excludes certain agencies from labor-management relations programs on national security grounds. 
The VA said it acted under that order to end union contracts covering hundreds of thousands of employees represented by five major labor organizations, including the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU), and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).
The implications are particularly significant in Virginia, which is home to more than 700,000 veterans and thousands of VA employees working in hospitals, clinics, and benefits offices across the state — including major medical centers in Richmond, Hampton, and Salem. 
The commonwealth also hosts regional benefits offices and serves as headquarters for several federal unions and advocacy organizations.
While the VA will maintain agreements for approximately 4,000 police officers, firefighters and security guards — occupations exempt from the executive order — the vast majority of bargaining-unit employees across the country are now operating without formal union contracts.
The move drew swift criticism from labor groups but was celebrated by Trump allies and VA leadership as a long-overdue realignment of priorities at an agency that serves more than 9 million veterans annually.
“This decision is good news for Veterans, families, caregivers and survivors,” VA Secretary Doug Collins said in a statement. “Too often, unions that represent VA employees fight against the best interests of Veterans while protecting and rewarding bad workers. We’re making sure VA resources and employees are singularly focused on the job we were sent here to do: providing top-notch care and service to those who wore the uniform.”
VA officials said the decision will allow managers to more effectively reward high performers, hold poor performers accountable and eliminate bureaucratic hurdles to hiring and reform. 
According to the agency, more than 1,900 VA employees collectively spent over 750,000 hours on union activity during fiscal year 2024 — time that was compensated with taxpayer dollars. Some employees performing union work earned more than $200,000 annually, the VA noted.
Additionally, the agency cited the use of over 187,000 square feet of VA office and clinical space by union representatives, free of charge, as a significant cost burden. Officials said those resources — which also include union access to government phones and computer systems — should be redirected to patient care and veteran services.
The move also halts payroll deductions for union dues for most employees, a change that took effect on April 25 in compliance with the executive order.
Labor organizations say the agency is turning its back on frontline workers, many of whom are veterans themselves, and warned that terminating collective bargaining agreements will degrade working conditions and compromise patient care.
“This is a direct attack on the rights of the people who care for our nation’s veterans,” Irma Westmoreland, chair of National Nurses United, told Axios. “Without a contract, nurses fear they won’t be empowered to speak up about conditions that put our patients at risk.”
The VA contends that unions have consistently resisted efforts to modernize the agency and hold employees accountable. 
Officials noted that AFGE, NFFE and NNOC/NNU opposed the bipartisan MISSION Act, which expanded veterans’ access to private-sector care. NFFE has also supported repealing the 2017 VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was designed to speed disciplinary action against employees and protect whistleblowers.
According to the VA, AFGE collaborated with the administration of former President Joe Biden to reinstate over 100 employees who were fired during Trump’s first term and helped secure nearly $134 million in back pay for more than 1,700 employees dismissed for alleged misconduct.
Labor advocates counter that these laws have been misused to retaliate against whistleblowers and sidestep due process protections, particularly during the Trump administration.
The action makes the VA the first federal agency to fully sever collective bargaining agreements under the Trump-era executive order, a move made possible by language exempting agencies involved in “national security” functions. 
Axios reported that the decision could affect up to 400,000 workers — roughly a quarter of the federal workforce with union protections. 
Though Biden revoked many Trump-era executive orders affecting federal workers upon taking office, this particular directive remained in place. A Trump spokesperson told Axios at the time that the action reflected the Republican’s priorities heading into the 2025 election, where he vowed to focus heavily on veterans’ issues and government accountability.
U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Virginia Democrats, criticized the move as harmful to the VA’s workforce and counterproductive to its mission. 
“The men and women who work at the VA, many of them veterans themselves, are on the front lines of making sure our nation keeps its promises to those who’ve served,” Warner said in an email Friday. 
He called the decision “shortsighted, counterproductive, and disrespectful to those who’ve worn the uniform,” warning that gutting collective bargaining rights would make it even harder for the agency to recruit and retain skilled professionals amid staffing shortages and rising demand for care. 
Kaine added that “VA employees in Virginia work tirelessly to deliver high-quality care to veterans in our communities,” and said that “diminishing their rights in the workplace will do nothing to strengthen services or improve efficiency — and those should be VA leadership’s real priorities.”
While the full impact of the VA’s action remains to be seen, labor leaders and policy analysts expect legal challenges and a new round of political fights over the balance between government efficiency and worker protections.
For now, the department insists its mission is clear.
“This is about putting veterans first,” said Collins. “And if that means upsetting union bosses who’ve been standing in the way of reform, so be it.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina Republicans attending the party’s annual fundraiser received a surprise phone call Saturday night from a previous keynote speaker — President Donald Trump.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who’s seeking re-election next year, took to the stage of the 58th annual Silver Elephant Gala and held his cellphone to the microphone so the president could speak to the crowd that twice helped elect him to the White House.
The unexpected call upstaged the main speaker for the event: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
“I will never forget your great state. South Carolina is a special state, and you’ve made it that way,” Trump told the nearly 770 Republicans in attendance.
Graham never mentioned his own campaign for a fifth term. Instead, he let Trump do the talking about his “full endorsement” of South Carolina’s senior senator.
“He’s a great guy. Every time I needed him, he was there for me, so I just won’t forget it,” Trump said on the call, earning whoops from the crowd.
“I don’t think it’s going to be a contest,” Trump added about Graham’s re-election. “I have a feeling you’re going to do very well.”
The surprise call stemmed from the golf course. Graham said he and former U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy played golf with Trump earlier in the day, though he didn’t say where.
“President Trump is an incredibly good golfer,” he said in introducing the call. “I have never played with anybody that consistent all the time.”

During the three-minute call, Trump also gave shout outs to Gov. Henry McMaster, first lady Peggy McMaster and state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick.
As Trump said goodbye and told attendees to have fun, the crowd clapped and cheered. It was the biggest applause of the night.
Trump carried 55% and 58% of the vote in South Carolina in 2016 and 2024, respectively. And even though he did not win the national race in 2020, Trump took 55% of South Carolinians’ vote that year.
The dinner, which cost donors up to $1,000 for a private pre-dinner reception, is the state party’s largest annual fundraiser. When Trump was the keynote speaker in 2023, he drew a record crowd of more than 1,300 people.
Other past headliners include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2021 and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2008, when he was an Indiana congressman. Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan was the speaker in 1967 for the inaugural Silver Elephant. Other former presidents to give the keynote address include Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.
 Candidates and endorsements

The gala came a day after former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer suspended his bid to challenge Graham. Bauer announced his exit on social media just one month after launching his campaign.
Bauer’s departure left two Republicans in the race to unseat Graham. Paul Dans of Charleston, who attended the gala, said Graham’s Trump phone stunt “smacked of desperation.”
“It was a very bad miscue by the Graham campaign to try to force feed this endorsement to the people,” Dans, an architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, told reporters at the event.
Graham wasn’t the only 2026 candidate on stage Saturday.
Three other hopefuls “paid to sponsor for the privilege to come to address you beautiful people this evening,” McKissick announced before handing over the mic.
Attendees heard stump speeches from Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is running for governor; state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch of Murrells Inlet, who is running to replace Wilson as attorney general; and state Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill, who is running for Congress to replace another gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of the 5th District.
“For those of you that are still on the fence, I just want the opportunity to earn your vote, earn your trust, to earn an opportunity to serve you as your governor,” Wilson told attendees.
Wilson, who’s in his fourth term as attorney general, was the only candidate among those who paid to speak who has an official GOP opponent for the June 2026 primaries.
So far, five Republicans have announced bids to replace McMaster, who can’t run again. Wilson was the first to hold an official launch event, though the race unofficially started soon after the November elections.
“The governor must not only be an agent of reform and change; the governor cannot be an agent of chaos,” he added.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of the coastal 1st District was the latest Republican to announce her bid, but she’s been pummeling her opponents on social media and at GOP events for months. She’s directed most of her ire at Wilson. Mace did not attend the gala.
Two other gubernatorial candidates — Lt. Gov. Pam Evette and Norman, the 5th District congressman — were there but did not address the crowd.
 ‘Know how to win’

In his main address following the campaign speeches, Youngkin invoked the fighting spirit of Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion.
He encouraged South Carolina Republicans to follow the Swamp Fox’s lead heading into the 2026 midterms that will decide whether the GOP will continue to control Congress.
“We don’t follow; we lead. And that is my challenge to all of you,” Youngkin said.
“Francis Marion showed all of us how to keep the fight alive,” he added, noting the country is gearing up to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution.
Youngkin pointed to the GOP supermajorities in both South Carolina’s House and Senate as a sign Republicans “know how to win” in the Palmetto state.
“And one of our largest missions in 2026 is to extend the majority in our House of Representatives in Washington,” he said. “That is a top priority.”
Youngkin’s election to governor in November 2021 put a Republican at the helm of the Old Dominion State for the first time in more than a decade.
“When you’re on the losing side, the consequences are dire,” Youngkin said. “When you’re on the winning side, Republicans can unleash prosperity and opportunity and lift up every South Carolinian, every Virginian, and every American. And because of those consequences, we have to continue to go to work.”
In his own race, Youngkin focused on education and tapped into parents’ anger over pandemic policies and classroom lessons in his upset win over former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who was the former Democratic National Committee chairman and chief fundraiser for the campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
His winning “parents matter” message helped fuel a GOP focus on parents’ rights.
In the wake of COVID-19, Youngkin said businesses were closing.
“We saw parents shut out of their children’s lives, and they were told boldly that parents should not have a role in determining what was being taught in our schools,” he told Silver Elephant attendees Saturday. “And for nearly a decade, more people were moving out of the Commonwealth of Virginia than were moving in.
“Now, a lot of them were moving here to South Carolina,” Youngkin added to laughter from the crowd. “A lot of them are moving here to South Carolina because South Carolina still believes in common sense conservative values: faith, family, and freedom.”
As for Youngkin, his term expires in January 2026. Virigina’s constitution does not allow governors to hold consecutive terms.
There’s some speculation he could make a bid for president in 2028. No mention of that was made Saturday.

The […]","A photo of the coal ash pond at the James Gavin Power Plant in Cheshire, Ohio included in documents to the EPA. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved the sale of a coal-fired electricity generator along the Ohio River. The plant is said to be one of the dirtiest in the United States, and its sale from one private equity group to another is raising concerns among environmentalists that its operations won’t become any cleaner.
The groups are heavily invested in the dirtiest forms of power generation and they spent heavily in the last election cycle. That’s raising fears among environmental groups that they’re pushing to roll back regulations in order to make their investments more valuable.
The energy regulatory commission, or FERC, on July 23 approved the sale of the General James M. Gavin Power Plant in Cheshire from Blackstone and ArcLight Capital Partners to Energy Capital Partners, a subsidiary of London-based Bridgepoint. 
All four companies are private equity firms, which pool cash from wealthy people and corporations, buy other companies and then sell all or part of them.
The firms have been accused of ruthlessly seeking profit — often by loading their purchases with debt, selling off the most valuable parts, declaring bankruptcy, and walking away. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Last year, companies owned by private equity firms made up 75 of 697 — or 11% — of all corporate bankruptcies, reported the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group. 
Most — 27 of 48 — bankruptcies involving liabilities of $500 million or more were filed by companies owned by private equity firms, the report said. 
Continued private equity ownership of Ohio’s Gavin Plant is particularly concerning to environmental groups because a 2023 analysis by the Sierra Club found it to be the deadliest in the United States. 
It estimated that due to the toxicity of its emissions and because of the direction of prevailing winds, the plant causes 224 premature deaths in the eastern United States each year.
It will also cost about $40 million to make the plant compliant with rules regarding the storage of toxic coal ash. Advocates fear that the plant’s private equity owners won’t work to make the plant cleaner.
“It is irresponsible for FERC to approve the sale of the Gavin coal plant to yet another private equity firm, (Energy Capital Partners), with so few conditions, knowing that pollution from the plant causes adverse health outcomes across the eastern U.S.,” Ryan Leitner of the Private Equity Stakeholder’s Project said in a written statement. “It is now incumbent upon ECP and its parent company, Bridgepoint, to commit to responsibly transitioning Gavin away from coal while maintaining reliability.” 
Environmental groups have been pushing for the owners of the 50-year-old, 2,600 megawatt plant to convert it to cleaner fuels or retire it altogether.
“Gavin consistently ranks as one of the worst and deadliest coal plants in the country,” Neil Waggoner of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign said in a written statement. “Continuing to operate it with no plan for transition to clean energy is irresponsible. ECP should commit to a plan to end coal burning operations at the Gavin plant.” 
Energy Capital Partners didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but it seems unlikely that it would voluntarily retire the plant. Signal Ohio reported last month that electricity prices are spiking in Ohio because of demand from the state’s booming fleet of data centers.
Private equity firms are highly invested in companies that produce or consume fossil fuels. The group Private Equity Climate Risks estimates that private equity-owned companies are responsible for 1.17 gigatons of emissions annually.
And after they spent heavily last election cycle, the administration of President Donald Trump has been removing climate rules. That presumably makes private-equity-owned fossil fuel companies more valuable.
Last month, the Trump EPA proposed to scrap the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 Endangerment Finding, which compels the agency to regulate greenhouse gases.
That’s happening after some in the private equity world supported Trump and his vice president, Ohio’s JD Vance.
Blackstone was the 10th-largest contributor to Vance’s PAC, Working for Ohio, according to OpenSecrets.com, donating $20,000 since 2019.
And Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman in May gave a crucial early endorsement of Trump.

(Photo by Bill Oxford/ Getty Images)Legislation that came out of the committee focused on local government was often criticized this past session for being frivolous at a time when Maine faced pressing budget issues and mounting health care costs. 
Amid the proposals to appoint a new state amphibian and designate a new state anthem, there was one bill that didn’t draw much attention but ended up being the second most lobbied bill in the Maine Legislature this year, with outside groups spending nearly $50,000 talking to lawmakers about the measure. 
That bill was LD 556, which prohibits municipalities from banning a particular energy source. Gov. Janet Mills signed it into law on July 1. The Republican-sponsored legislation divided members of Mills’ own party as it straddled key priorities including local control, rising costs for Maine households and environmental issues. 
Conversations with both proponents and critics of the bill highlight how constituents’ concerns over rising energy costs ultimately opened the door for a new law that some worry could hamper local efforts to phase out fossil fuels. 
“A similar bill having been defeated a couple years ago, we just weren’t expecting it to pop up again,” said Nick Janzen, director of policy and partnerships for Maine Conservation Voters, whose disclosures show a sharp uptick in lobbying activity after the group realized it was gaining momentum and had some Democratic support. 
Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matt Harrington (R-York) introduced a similar bill back in the 131st Legislature, but it was rejected by both the Maine House of Representatives and Senate. During the committee process, that bill was amended to allow towns to incentivize certain energy sources, as well as leave room for restrictions rooted in safety or zoning issues. 
How key climate, environmental bills fared in Augusta this past session

The bill that succeeded in the 132nd Legislature mirrored that amended language. Harrington called it “instrumental in showing that bipartisanship can happen in Augusta.” 
During the March 24 public hearing before the State and Local Government Committee, Harrington argued it would not only safeguard a homeowner’s ability to choose how to heat their home, but it would also aid affordable housing construction by allowing developers to choose affordable energy systems.
After passing the committee, the bill sat on the Senate’s list of unfinished business for about a month and a half. When it was finally taken up in the final days of session, the Senate voted 17-17, with one member excused, rejecting the measure. The House then voted 81-67 in support, sending it back to the upper chamber, which ultimately backed the bill by a vote of 17-16, with two members excused. 
Concerns about environment
Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) said the bill was marketed to legislators as a tool for preserving consumer choice in an energy market where costs are high. But he also said there was some complacency in his caucus because the bill had been “beaten over and over again.”
“Had we sought to explain to people in our caucus earlier that this was incredibly dangerous, had we flagged this months ahead of time and understood that there was an actual threat of this passing, I think perhaps maybe we could have fended it off this time,” Ankeles said. 
On the House floor, Ankeles said he feared LD 556 would be “one of the more environmentally unfriendly bills” sent to the governor’s desk this year. He told Maine Morning Star he stands by those comments and believes it is a “terrible bill.”
Environmental groups were also caught on the back foot. 
The Environmental Priorities Coalition, a statewide alliance of 39 conservation, climate action, and public health organizations, designated the previous iteration of the bill a priority in the 131st Legislature. But Janzen said because that bill had been defeated by a safe margin in both chambers, the bill wasn’t on the coalition’s radar in December when it selected what bills to hone in on this session. 
However, after the public hearing, Maine Conservation Voters spent significant time lobbying against the bill because Janzen said it blocks local communities from achieving clean energy goals and protects fossil fuel infrastructure. 
“Under the cloak of words like ‘choice’ and ‘freedom,’ [LD 556] puts the state’s thumb on the scale for the fossil fuel industry, despite common knowledge that it contributes to climate change, poor health outcomes, air pollution, rising ocean temperature, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and more,” said former Director of Government Affairs Cathy Breen in her testimony to the committee.

Multiple House Democrats who opposed the bill also expressed fears that it would block environmental progress. Rep. Sue Salisbury of Westbrook, who co-chairs the local government committee, said on the floor it “hamstrings Maine’s climate response,” while Rep. Sophie Warren of Scarborough said the bill was “propped up and fueled by the fossil fuel industry.”
Heating oil and propane companies, including Dead River Company and Maritime Energy, testified in support of the bill. 
Also, at the same time environmental groups like Maine Conservation Voters were frantically reaching out to lawmakers about the legislation, fossil fuel interests were also throwing money behind the bill. 
Megan Diver, a lobbyist for Maine Energy Marketers Association, which represents heating oil, propane, biofuels and motor fuels sellers, submitted five reports where she records some level of compensation (less than $1,000) for lobbying on LD 556. The disclosures also show the organization spent almost $50,000 on what is described as grassroots lobbying, spending $27,500 on social media and website design and $20,495 in targeted texts and calls to action. 
The law’s passage was also celebrated by the National Propane Gas Association.
Maine has historically been highly dependent on heating oil, but that has been declining in recent years. In 2010, seven in 10 homes used heating oil. That dropped to just over half of homes in 2023, according to a news release from Mills’ office last October attributing some of that decrease to the state’s effort to transition people to electric heat pumps. 
Proponents of the bill countered those concerns by pointing out that the now-law won’t restrict a town from incentivizing a particular energy source, including heat pumps, solar or other renewables. 
However, Janzen argued towns don’t have the financial ability to offer effective incentives like tax credits or rebates that exist on the state level. 
While there weren’t examples cited during committee meetings or in interviews with Maine Morning Star of specific Maine towns actively seeking to ban an energy source for heating purposes, bill supporters pointed to the climate action plan for Portland and South Portland, which says those communities are looking for ways to eliminate the use of fossil fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
A question of local control
But environmental issues weren’t the only factor for lawmakers. There was also debate as to whether this decision should lie with local or state officials. 
Maine has been a “home rule” state since 1969, when an amendment was added to the state constitution that gave towns and cities broad power to create their own ordinances. Home rule allows residents more control over what their individual communities look like.
That authority is the reason why the Maine Municipal Association, which offers professional services to municipalities and local governments, opposed the bill, said Director of Advocacy and Communications Kate Dufour. Though the Legislature is allowed to prohibit certain action from municipal governments, Dufour said her organization felt this legislation would erode local control.
“We presented our thoughts with respect to home rule authority and the ability of the residents of the state of Maine to make decisions that suit their needs and unfortunately, that message did not prevail,” Dufour said.
The bill’s lobbying report mentions a couple lawmakers that the group spoke with directly, both of whom Dufour said are current municipal officials. Dufour said it’s not uncommon for the organization to participate in the legislative process to provide a municipal perspective.










We presented our thoughts with respect to home rule authority and the ability of the residents of the state of Maine to make decisions that suit their needs and unfortunately, that message did not prevail.


– Kate Dufour, Maine Municipal Association


Harrington said many legislators were hung up on the idea of this bill being a local control issue, but he sees it as “the ultimate local control,” because it ensures that homeowners aren’t being told how they can or can’t heat their homes.
He also noted that the Legislature passed other bills limiting local authority, including LD 731, which prohibits municipalities from barring homeless shelters, but maintains their ability to regulate those facilities. 
Since Republicans often defer to local control when making policy decisions in Augusta, Rep. Ann Matlack (D-St. George), who opposed the bill, said on the House floor it’s ironic that the other side of the aisle is “anti-home rule” on this issue.
Ankeles described the legislation as a “blunt instrument” that gives veto power over local energy policies to the fossil fuel industry.
Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot), who co-sponsored the legislation, believes local control is important on some issues, but said in this case he felt the public interest outweighed that authority. He argued that this sort of policy isn’t unprecedented, pointing to a statute that says municipalities can’t ban solar on residential property.
Additionally, the new law avoids a patchwork of more than 400 different energy policies across the state. Baldacci argued that uniformity could help stabilize energy prices for Mainers.
Why now?
While lawmakers couldn’t point to one factor that made the legislation successful this time around, energy prices were a throughline. 
Energy prices in Maine have increased in recent years for a variety of reasons, such as increased recovery costs from the series of winter storms that ravaged the state two years ago. But the biggest factor has been the volatility of electricity supply prices, in particular natural gas, said Phil Bartlett, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission. 
Data from the Office of Public Advocate show that residential customers’ bills increased by 20.7% in Central Maine Power territory and nearly 12% in the Versant Bangor Hydro district between June 2024 and June 2025. There was also a 15% increase for residential customers in the Versant Maine Public District, which is in the northern part of the state. 
Harrington pointed to the law’s ability to preserve energy choice at a time when the cost of heating homes is so front of mind for people. Hearing about that from their constituents probably influenced lawmakers when voting on this bill. 
“Full autonomy was the real nexus of the bill,” he told Maine Morning Star. 
Baldacci, who co-chairs the State and Local Government Committee, attributed its passage to “sound policy and luck.” 
Baldacci said his argument to his Democratic colleagues was that low- and middle-income residents are the ones who could be most hurt by policies like a ban on propane because they are least able to make those adjustments.
Once the bill got to Mills’ desk, it was unlikely to receive a veto, due to an energy choice pledge she signed when running for reelection in 2022. 
Maine Energy Marketers Association, which has been working on this issue for several years, had asked candidates running for state and federal office in 2022 and 2024 to sign a pledge promising to support legislation that preserved a Mainer’s ability to choose how to heat their homes, explained President and Chief Executive Officer Charlie Summers.
Summer also said a large portion of state legislators also signed the pledge during the 2024 election cycle. Baldacci, along with Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), participated in the campaign last year. 
Summers, whose organization had spent thousands of dollars texting voters about the legislation, said the bill’s success this year could be attributed to the time it can take legislators to become educated about a bill or issue. 
Summers said in addition to protecting a Mainer’s ability to choose how to heat their home, the new law also prevents a household that may use a mix of natural gas, wood heat or some other heating mechanisms in long Maine winters from relying on one source of energy.
“It doesn’t allow for all our eggs to be put in one basket,” he said.

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.











This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida



Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Brian Kemp's decision to back Derek Dooley in the GOP primary in next year's U.S. Senate race in Georgia is conjuring up memories of the governor's decision to appoint Kelly Loeffler to the Senate in 2019. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder (2020 file photo)Stop me if you’ve heard this story before.
Gov. Brian Kemp needs a U.S. Senate candidate. He promises to work with the White House toward a candidate both he and President Donald Trump can get behind. The governor then decides to go his own route and throws his full support behind a little-known candidate. His pick frustrates the White House and divides the Republican base ahead of a pivotal race.
By backing Derek Dooley for U.S. Senate, the governor is again finding himself on a collision course with the White House as he hedges his bets on a blank-slate candidate.
Kemp, who was his party’s dream challenger to take on Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff before ultimately declining to run, had committed to working with Trump’s team toward finding a consensus candidate. The governor told donors to keep their “powder dry” and made several trips to Washington to discuss the race with the White House and Senate Republicans.
But over the summer, word began spreading that Dooley was weighing a bid with Kemp’s support. A former coach at Tennessee and the son of Georgia coaching giant Vince Dooley, Derek Dooley began lining up a team that included many of the governor’s top advisers.
Kemp even called other candidates to tell them that he would not be supporting their campaigns as he works to boost his longtime friend. While he was able to nudge Insurance Commissioner John King out of the race, his involvement appears to have not only “p—-d off” the president’s inner circle but emboldened other candidates: U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-St. Simons Island) said he wasn’t going anywhere, and U.S. Rep. Mike Collins (R-Jackson) announced his own bid the next week.
Both Collins and Carter are competing for the MAGA lane in a primary almost certain to be dominated by Trump and his supporters, while Dooley works to prove himself as a reliable conservative who can bridge the divide between the party’s two factions.
It’s an eerily familiar situation for Kemp, who found himself in a nearly identical situation in 2019 after the resignation of longtime U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Despite being urged by the White House and conservative activists to appoint a more Trump-aligned figure, Kemp went his own route and appointed businesswoman and Republican donor Kelly Loeffler.
Loeffler tried to make inroads with the president’s supporters, but doubts about her conservative credentials — and tenuous ties to Georgia — seemed to follow her wherever she went. And U.S. Rep. Doug Collins (not related to Mike Collins), who was Trump’s preferred choice for the coveted appointment, campaigned for the seat anyway.
The two spent most of the campaign trying to out-right one another, driving up each other’s unfavorable ratings and dividing the Republican base in the process. Loeffler ultimately finished second in the top-two primary but was then defeated by now-Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) after failing to get the party back on a winning message.
This time around, Kemp is again hedging his bets on a blank-slate Senate candidate with thin (or questionable) ties to the Peach State. Dooley’s father might be an icon in Athens, but Derek Dooley has spent the majority of his coaching career outside of Georgia.
And like Loeffler, Dooley is sure to face questions about his voting trail. He hasn’t voted in many recent elections or Republican primaries and declined to declare his affiliation in states that have party registration. His only known political footprint is a $5,500 contribution to Kemp’s campaign.
His opponents wasted no time going on the attack. Collins’ campaign mocked Dooley by sharing a video of the Volunteers’ controversial loss to the Louisiana Tigers in 2010, when the Tigers were awarded an untimed down at the end of regulation after a too-many-men penalty against Dooley’s defense.
Collins’ team shared a separate ad taking aim at Dooley with a simple but potent line of attack: “Never fights. Never wins. Never Trump.”
Carter also thinks Dooley is ill-equipped to take on the first-term Ossoff. “This is serious stuff now — I don’t want to hear about, you know, we’re just going to put this to a popularity contest. That’s not what this is,” Carter said of his rival. “You got to have somebody who can go toe to toe with this kid, and I’m that person who can go toe to toe with him.”
Democrats also plan to make Dooley’s coaching career the centerpiece of their attacks, with party chair Charlie Bailey quickly labeling him as a “failed and fired former Tennessee football coach.”
“We’ll see what’s harder for Dooley — answering for a Trump bill that strips health care for 750,000 Georgians, or remembering which SEC team to root for,” Bailey said in a statement.
So as Kemp places all his eggs in the Dooley basket, he must keep in mind that he is doing so with a lot less capital than he had when he appointed Loeffler. With just a year left in his term and no (immediate) plans to run for office again soon, he has a lot less political leverage to wield over his legislative allies, many of whom are supporting Collins and are keenly aware of which direction their party is going.
What’s clear is that this Republican infighting in what had traditionally been a red state will play right into Democrats’ hands. As the Ossoff campaign asked in an email:
“Didn’t Republicans learn their lesson the last time they tried to oust a Democratic Senator in Georgia?”

As the Trump administration ramps up deportations nationwide, a new Arkansas law requires law enforcement agencies across the state to aid federal immigration authorities.
The law, which went into effect Tuesday, requires sheriffs to apply to a program with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that trains and certifies officers to serve immigration warrants on undocumented people already being held in county jails for other reasons.
But some agencies, including the Arkansas State Police, are going much further than the new state law requires. They are signing up for a different type of partnership with ICE that allows cops to stop people on the street, question them about their immigration status and potentially arrest them for deportation proceedings.
This program, which ICE calls its “task force model,” was discontinued during the Obama administration amid lawsuits over racial profiling but revived earlier this year under Trump.
On July 7, ICE signed off on a memorandum of agreement with Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar that gives participating troopers the “power and authority to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or remain in the United States.” Troopers don’t need warrants to make these arrests “if the officer has reason to believe the alien to be arrested is in the United States in violation of law and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained,” the task force agreement says.




Cindy Murphy, an Arkansas State Police spokesperson, said Thursday that no troopers are participating in the task force program as of now. (That may be because officers are required to undergo training first. ICE’s website says task force officer nominees must “complete a 40 hour online course covering, among other things, scope of authority, immigration law, civil rights law, cross-cultural issues, liability issues, complaint procedures and obligations under federal law.”)




Once the training is complete, though, participating troopers will have the authority to make immigration-related arrests on their own, even without an ICE agent being present.
That “will be up to the discretion of the trained trooper,” Murphy said. The program is expected to eventually operate in all areas of the state.



“Arkansas State Police looks forward to working with federal immigration officials through the 287(g) program to protect Arkansans from violent, criminal illegal immigrants,” Murphy said.



Immigration violations are typically civil offenses, not criminal ones, and ICE data shows the agency has arrested an increasing number of unauthorized immigrants in recent months who don’t have criminal charges or convictions. Axios reported in July that non-criminal ICE arrests rose in Arkansas last month, drawing from federal data obtained by the UC Berkeley School of Law’s Deportation Data Project. The New York Times reported in June that the daily rate of arrests made by ICE in Arkansas had jumped by 176% between Jan. 20 and June 10 when compared to 2024.
Murphy didn’t address a question from the Arkansas Times about whether the Arkansas State Police will arrest people solely for violations of civil immigration law, even if there’s no alleged criminal offense at play. She also didn’t answer questions about how the state police will determine who to ask about their immigration status or how the agency will avoid the racial profiling concerns that dogged ICE’s task force program in the past.



The cost to the state police is expected to be “minimal,” Murphy said, “as we already have training facilities and staffing.”



Arkansas isn’t the only red state to embrace the newly revived task force model. ICE’s website shows agencies overseeing state police departments in states including Missouri, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Florida have recently signed task force agreements. ProPublica reported in June that state troopers in Tennessee have assisted with large-scale ICE operations in Nashville by pulling over drivers.
Hundreds of local law enforcement agencies around the country are also participating in the task force program as of August, including five in Arkansas: the Baxter County Sheriff’s Office, the Miller County Sheriff’s Office, the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Office, the Texarkana Police Department and the police department in Hampton, a south Arkansas town of about 1,200.
All of those agreements have been signed within the past six weeks, ICE records show.
Though Arkansas state troopers may not yet be actively participating in the task force program, community advocates say they’re already helping out with ICE operations in Northwest Arkansas, which is home to a large immigrant population. Irvin Camacho, the co-founder of a group called the Alliance for Immigrant Respect and Education, or AIRE, said organizers began noticing about three months ago that state police were stopping and arresting an increasing number of people not just on the state highways they routinely patrol, but in other places, too. There have been a number of arrests in Springdale and Rogers, he said.
“Something is happening, because we’re seeing much more state troopers on the regular streets,” Camacho said. “And a lot of the time, when we see those stops, it’s immigrant-presenting people.”
AIRE tracks ICE activity in Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley. The group recently posted a picture to social media showing two alleged plainclothes ICE agents pretending to be shopping at a store in Fort Smith shortly before they reportedly detained a female employee. AIRE posted a video this week of a man in Fort Smith being pulled out of his truck outside of his home by two alleged ICE agents; he was later released, Camacho said, after immigration officials determined the man was in the country legally.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hagar_Shue_Jones-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

It’s an article of faith on the political far right that the Trump administration’s mass immigrant deportation policies will be a boon to U.S. born workers.
A new report from economists at the Economic Policy Institute, however, finds the opposite to be true and that the net impact of mass deportation on employment – both for immigrants and U.S. born workers – is decidedly negative.
Indeed, the administration’s goal of deporting one-million people per year will lead to a loss of nearly six million jobs over the coming years – more than forty percent of them held by U.S. born workers.
To understand why, consider the following: When houses don’t get built because there aren’t enough immigrant workers to roof them, there are fewer jobs for the U.S. born workers who tend to handle more skilled professions like plumbing and electrical work. Other industries will experience similar phenomena.
The bottom line: The report is entitled “Trump’s deportation agenda will destroy millions of jobs,” and it’s a must read for anyone who cares about our economy. Check it out at epi.org.

The last few weeks of summer, heading into Labor Day weekend, can sometimes mean vacations and driving more miles on the road for all people, including teens.
Traffic crashes are the No. 1 cause of death for teens, and the crash rate for teen drivers is disproportionately higher than the share of licensed teen drivers.
In addition to this grim statistic, summer is the riskiest time for teen drivers. The 100 deadliest days represent the period from Memorial Day to Labor Day when the number of fatal crashes involving teen drivers dramatically increases. A third of each year’s teen driver crashes occur during the summer.
We are scholars who research transportation safety and teen driver behavior. Our expertise helps us understand that these 100 days are not just a statistical fluke – they reflect a dangerous intersection of factors such as inexperience and a propensity to take risks.

  More time on the road means more risk for inexperienced drivers. (Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Digital Vision via Getty Images)
 What makes summer different?

Regardless of the season, some teen drivers engage in risky behaviors that increase their likelihood of a fatal crash, such as getting distracted, driving with friends in the vehicle, driving under the influence, not wearing seat belts and a lack of hazard awareness.
Teens also have more free time in the summer, since most aren’t in school. Combined with the longer days and better weather, teens drive more over the summer. More time on the road means more risk, especially for inexperienced drivers.
Teens may also be more likely to drive after dark during the summer, in comparison to more experienced drivers. But nighttime driving is also when visibility is reduced and crash risks are higher, particularly for teens who haven’t fully developed the skills necessary for night driving. This increased exposure, in addition to teens’ general risky driving tendencies, contributes to the 100 deadliest days for teen drivers.
The increased crash risk for teens over the summer isn’t equally distributed either. Crashes with teen drivers that lead to serious injuries are more likely to occur with male drivers, in rural areas, for those of lower socioeconomic status and for those with disorders, such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.

  Driver’s education programs can be effective, but not all teenagers have access to them. (Photo by Antonio Diaz/iStock via Getty Images)
 Teaching young drivers

Driver’s education programs are the formal method to teach teen drivers the rules of the road.
In driver’s education programs, teens receive information about driver and road safety though classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction in preparation for the licensing exam. Some states require teens to complete a driver’s education course if they want to receive a license under the age of 18. Of teens who have a license, nearly 80% of them have gone through some form of driver’s education.
Though driver’s education programs can be helpful, their effects are not equally felt. In some states, teens and their guardians must pay out of pocket for driver’s education courses to obtain a license. This makes driver’s education and, as a consequence, obtaining a driver’s license inequitable.
There are also driving school deserts – areas where the poverty rate is 20% or above and there are no behind-the-wheel driver education courses within a 10- to 15-minute drive. This makes driver education courses inaccessible. Many of these driving school deserts happen to be in areas with high populations of minorities.
Over 20 years ago, graduated driver licensing was introduced to reduce teen crash rates. This is a phased licensing system wherein teen drivers are restricted in terms of when, where and with whom they can drive until they turn 18. Such a system allows teens to gradually learn and gain experience with driving over time.
Graduated driver licensing has been implemented in all 50 states, and it has been shown to reduce teen driver crash rates. However, its effectiveness is limited to those who participate in the system. A large number of teens are unlicensed and are of low socioeconomic status. Many of these unlicensed teens forgo the entire process and remain unlicensed but still drive, well into their 20s when the graduated driver licensing restrictions are lifted.

 Making summer safer

There are two things people can do to turn the 100 deadliest days into the 100 safest days.
First, it is important that communities offer free supplementary training programs for teen drivers, because becoming a safe and responsible teen driver shouldn’t be limited to those with resources. As one example, in collaboration with industry partners, we have developed a program called Risk-ATTEND. It is a free, online, evidence-based program that teaches teen drivers how to anticipate risks while driving. Our research has shown that programs such as these can improve teen driving skills and may be especially effective for teen drivers in high-poverty areas.
Second, our research has shown that parents and guardians still play an important role in influencing teen driver behavior. Studies show that teens mirror the behaviors they observe: If they see adults text and drive, they’re more likely to do the same.
Once teenagers become old enough to drive, it is also important to establish rules and guidelines about expectations to establish clarity and accountability. Written agreements or checklists can address high-risk conditions such as nighttime driving, driving with other young passengers, phone use and adherence to speed limits.
Systems to help monitor and enforce rules have been shown to be effective in improving teen driver behavior. One such program is Checkpoints, which is a Connecticut-based program in which families agree to limit teen driving during high-risk conditions. Teens face consequences for violating these limits, such as a temporary loss of driving privileges. However, the limits are gradually lifted as they gain driving experience.

 More than rules matter

Ultimately, preventing crashes in the summer and beyond extends beyond mere adherence to regulations. Avoiding them fundamentally hinges on cultivating a robust safety culture that emphasizes a collective commitment to risk reduction and continuous improvement in driving practices.
For teens, the summer months present unique challenges and opportunities.
Drawing on best practices, such as training programs, teens can build essential skills in varied conditions before gaining full, unsupervised privileges.

Here, she talks during a meeting last spring. (File photo by Annmarie Timmins/New Hampshire Bulletin)Tara Ryan was only seven weeks pregnant with her first child when she secured slots on four child care waitlists. Even then, her daughter didn’t get a full-time space until she was 1.
Now expecting a son through in vitro fertilization, Ryan said the first to know about her embryo transfer was the child care center, “so that we could secure a child care spot for him” — more than a year out from when they’ll need it. The price tag to have both children at the facility is over $50,000, though they’re sitting on waitlists at two less-expensive options.
“It’s unaffordable to us,” said Ryan, of Durham, a founder of the state chapter of Chamber of Mothers, a nonprofit, grassroots group focused on issues such as parental leave, maternal health, and child care. “Like, who can afford that for child care? I just, I don’t even know who can, but we’re gonna figure it out. We have to figure it out.”
Her story is emblematic of a child care system in New Hampshire and beyond that gobbles up household incomes while providing few options for families and low wages for workers as the average provider operates on razor-thin profit margins. Amid a busy budget session, New Hampshire lawmakers directed some attention to the topic, though early care and education issues made up only a small sprinkle of bills in a sea of more than 1,100 weighed in Concord this year.
While advocates and lawmakers involved in the issues came out of the session with some wins, they felt the state had a long way to go in making a dent in addressing affordability and access. Several said New Hampshire needed to bring in more revenue to make lasting, systemic changes to the child care issues plaguing the state.
The new budget will allow additional federal dollars to be routed to the child care scholarship program, a state-federal partnership that more families have become eligible for in the last year with an expanded income cap, should the funds be needed to prevent a waitlist. 
The Legislature also greenlit a pilot program, coming in 2026, that aims to cut down on administrative burdens for the scholarship for families and providers. It would provide a presumptive eligibility period for families after an initial screening, allowing earlier access to scholarship funds while they complete the application process. 
Lawmakers also hope to use $15 million in federal dollars over two fiscal years for a child care workforce grant program, but it remains unclear whether the federal government will allow the money to be used for that purpose.
In other action, a new law will include pending charges, instead of just convictions, in criminal record checks for child care workers and dissolves the child care licensing fund into the general fund. Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican who sponsored the enacting Senate Bill 22, said the measure was requested by the state Department of Health and Human Services. 
Also this session, the Legislature rejected a bill that would’ve provided property-tax relief and school building aid to some child care agencies. 
In a statement through her office, Gov. Kelly Ayotte emphasized the action related to the scholarship program, and also highlighted $1 million that will go to the state’s community college system for creating pathways for child care workforce training. She said helping families access affordable child care was a “critical need and an important part of ensuring we remain the best in the nation for economic opportunity.”
“Looking ahead,” said Ayotte, a Republican, “we will ensure Granite Staters can continue to access child care scholarships, remove unnecessary barriers to entry for new providers, and partner with our community colleges, the private sector, and nonprofits like the Boys and Girls Club to expand child care options for our families and advance career opportunities in the child care workforce.”
Scholarship program
It costs the average family over $30,000 a year to put an infant and toddler in a child care center in New Hampshire, according to 2024 data from Child Care Aware of America.
In the last budget, lawmakers expanded eligibility for the state’s child care scholarship program to families making up to 85% of the state median income. Those in the program pay a cost-share for child care ranging from $0 to 7% of the family’s income. (For child care to be considered “affordable” by the federal government, it must take up no more than 7% of a family’s income.)
Some families who didn’t meet the income threshold last year may be newly eligible due to adjustments to the state median income this July. A family of four earning up to $124,595 and a family of three earning $104,660 may now be eligible for the scholarship, said Nicole Heller, senior policy analyst at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research nonprofit. 
In this state budget, lawmakers focused on cutting down paperwork burdens that may have dissuaded eligible families from accessing assistance and providers from participating in the program. 
Trina Ingelfinger, the early care and education policy coordinator at New Futures, a health policy advocacy group, said her organization had heard “from both providers and families over the last year or so that overly burdensome paperwork requirements were making it difficult to access the program, and as a result, this was interfering with families’ path back to work, and we also understood that some child care providers were opting out of the program because of these issues.”
The budget establishes a two-year pilot program, starting in January 2026, that will give families who have undergone an initial screening access to the scholarship while they complete the application process. This period may be 60 days; until a final eligibility determination is made; or when a timeframe to submit necessary information and documents, determined by DHHS, has expired — whatever comes first. 
Neither child care providers nor families will be on the hook for paying back scholarship funds should it ultimately be determined a child is ineligible for the program, “except in cases of fraud or intentional violation of program rules,” the law says.
The budget also aims to reduce burdens on providers by eliminating the requirement to report hourly attendance for scholarship recipients, “to the extent that such reporting is not necessary for administrating child care scholarship payments.”
The department will write a detailed report about the results of the pilot program for agency oversight committees in the Legislature by May 1, 2028. 
The law also requires the department to, by December, implement a system that will allow providers to receive scholarship payments “in advance of or at the beginning of each payment period.”
The budget appropriates $100,000 to the department to implement these directives. It also allows the state to tap into additional Temporary Assistance for Needy Families reserve funds if they’re needed to prevent a waitlist from forming.
Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Bedford Republican, said in a statement to the Bulletin that the law “simply makes it easier for eligible families to participate in the scholarship program and return to work.”
“Because of the safeguards in the bill, like a family screening process, the program is not expected to expand eligibility or create any new costs for the state once it is up and running,” Ricciardi said.
Historically, many families who are eligible for the program have not participated in it, but increased enrollment numbers have followed expanded eligibility. Heller pointed to April data from the state that showed the number of children using scholarships has jumped 66% since the expanded eligibility went into effect in January 2024, adding another 1,700 children to the program. 
Workforce grant uncertain, tax relief quashed
The budget directs DHHS to ask the federal government for permission to use TANF reserve funds “for the purpose of financing recruitment and retention bonus and benefit grants for New Hampshire child care employees.”
It’s not yet clear whether the federal government will approve the use of the money. 
The child care workforce in the state faces massive stressors, with high turnover and low wages. With cost-of-living adjustments, New Hampshire’s child care workers “have the second-lowest wages in the country,” according to a primer from the University of New Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy. (The Couch Family Foundation, which funds the New Hampshire Bulletin’s early care and education reporting position, provided support for this research.)
To put the intersecting challenges of the sector into perspective, the researchers found that “if a child care worker were to purchase center-based care for their own infant and four-year old, this expense would utilize 98.6 percent of the average New Hampshire child care worker salary.”
One possible method for cutting down costs for providers was ultimately quashed this year. Senate Bill 275, led by Dover Democratic Sen. David Watters, sought to provide property tax relief for some child care agencies, as well as allowing school building aid to be used for some pre-kindergarten programs. 
The Senate voted, 16-8, along party lines, to shoot down the legislation. Sen. Timothy Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, argued the bill was too broad and would deplete limited school building aid resources.
Watters said it became apparent, once the session was rolling, that there would be “real resistance” from his Republican colleagues on the issue. But looking ahead to the future, he said the chamber has historically been able to get “some very good things done in a very strong, unanimous, bipartisan fashion.”
“The governor campaigned on this. We all did, Republicans and Democrats,” Watters said. “We all campaigned on … housing and on child care and on energy and, you know, some other things. But you know, I mean, the very top priorities are for housing and child care.”
Looking ahead
State investments are needed to make significant changes to the child care landscape in New Hampshire, some of those involved in the issue said.
Shannon Tremblay, director of the New Hampshire Child Care Advisory Council, enacted by the Legislature in 1995, emphasized a need for the state to find revenue sources to invest in child care. She said that should include revisiting the recently eliminated interest and dividends tax, which generated tens of millions of dollars for the state each year.
“We’re rich. I mean, we’re one of the most wealthiest states, but we don’t invest that money,” Tremblay said. “And if you say the word taxes, you know, people tend to cringe, but I think that’s what it’s really going to take.”
MacKenzie Nicholson, New Hampshire’s senior director of the advocacy group MomsRising, said she wants to “see a system that actually invests in child care.” Small policy fixes that act as “little Band-Aids aren’t doing enough to cover the gaping wound that is our child care crisis right now,” she said.
“The reason that we didn’t really lose child care dollars in the budget process this year is because there is none to cut. As a state, we don’t invest in child care,” Nicholson said. “The money that comes in comes from the federal government, and so there’s no way to offset the costs for families or for providers, who ultimately are the workforce behind the workforce.”
On the issue of child care, Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, a Portsmouth Democrat and the Senate’s minority leader, said “we just continue to not do enough.” That could have serious consequences for the state, she said.
“This is a huge issue, you know, for people that want to come and build a family and live and work in New Hampshire,” Perkins Kwoka said. “The availability of child care and housing is just fundamental to them being able to move and build their lives here, and if we don’t accommodate it, they’re going to find and build their lives somewhere else.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tararyanchamberofmoms-1024x711.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra and Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. Meet Shefali and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics, and policy.
When there’s a maternal health emergency, Jessica Wheat springs into action.
Alongside a group of specialized health providers at Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Wheat works fast to make sure patients are able to have their babies delivered safely or their children given critical treatment at the Level III neonatal intensive care unit on site.
“We have just an abundance of resources, and people that know what they’re doing,” the labor and delivery nurse said.
That abundance is coming to an end. Last month, HCA Midwest Health, which owns Research Medical Center, announced it was closing its obstetrics program and NICU. The umbrella company that runs HCA Midwest Health, which oversees multiple hospitals and related sites of care in nearly two dozen states, cited declining births at the hospital as part of its reasons for the closure.
Wheat is worried about the implications for local patients who often struggle to find transportation even across Kansas City. But she’s also concerned about the rural patients outside of the metro area.
“We tend to get smaller hospitals that will Life Flight bleeding moms or moms who are breech or moms who are having a hypertensive crisis,” she said. “We can do the emergency C-section — a lot of smaller hospitals do not have those capabilities. The farther they have to go, the more at risk they’re going to be for complications, even death.”
The availability of obstetrics care in America has been dwindling for years. That could accelerate now, as hospital leaders across the country warn that President Donald Trump’s massive cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income Americans, could leave pregnant people in rural communities with vanishingly few options for medical care.
Obstetrics is one of the most expensive services provided by hospitals, especially in rural areas, which often see a larger portion of Medicaid patients. Nationwide, the program pays for about 40 percent of all births. With financial hits looming, hospitals are primed to close maternity wards first, and rural areas are particularly vulnerable.
“This is going to have an enormous impact,” said Dr. John Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, a remote city of about 4,000 people. “Already we’re seeing OB deserts that are increasing in size, and after the passage of this bill those are going to be markedly worse — where people are going to have to drive hundreds of miles before they can get prenatal care, much less delivery.”
For years, hospitals facing financial pressure have shuttered maternity wards. Between 2010 and 2022, more than 500 hospitals across the country dropped obstetrics, per a recent study that also shows more than half of rural counties now have no hospital-based obstetric services. A report from the advocacy group March of Dimes found that 1 in 3 U.S. counties had no OBGYN at all.
There are numerous reasons for the recent closures, ranging from declining births to difficulties hiring local providers. But the biggest issue is financial: Hospitals typically don’t earn enough from labor and delivery to cover the cost. Now, cuts to Medicaid — which will further cut hospital revenues and increase their share of uncompensated care — threaten to strain finances further.
“I do have a lot of concern that we’ll continue to see labor and delivery units close in rural hospitals and potentially even at an accelerated rate, as hospitals feel greater strain due to cuts in the bill,” said Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association.
The National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, a consulting firm, estimated in June that the proposed Medicaid cuts over 10 years could reach almost $70 billion just for rural hospitals. Nearly half of all children and 1 in 5 adults in rural communities are enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program. The health insurance plan also pays hospitals less for the same services than private insurance does.
“When rural hospitals say, ‘We have these big Medicaid cuts, how do we deal with that shortfall?’ the OB units are going to be first on the chopping block,” said Jamie Daw, an associate professor of health policy at Columbia University.
One analysis from the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonpartisan organization that supports policies such as equal pay and access to health care, suggests that the new cuts to Medicaid put almost 150 rural hospitals with maternity services at risk of serious downsizing or closing altogether.
The changes to Medicaid — including cumbersome new paperwork requirements for people insured through the program, and cuts to some of the taxes used to finance state Medicaid programs — largely won’t take effect until after the 2026 midterm elections. But already, hospitals are preparing for huge reductions in services, and pointing to labor and delivery as one of their most vulnerable offerings.
Michigan-based Trinity Health operates five hospitals that include maternity services. Hospital leaders are deeply concerned about service cuts that would make it harder for pregnant patients to get appropriate medical care, said Dr. Sharon O’Leary, an OBGYN and the organization’s chief data analytics and chief equity officer.
When patients have to travel further for prenatal care, they are more likely to cut the number of doctors’ visits or to receive no prenatal care at all. Studies over the past several years have shown that obstetrics unit closures — and increased travel time for pregnant patients — result in higher rates of pregnancy-related complications, including premature birth and low birth weight.
“Our biggest fear is that as women lose coverage that they will not seek prenatal care,” O’Leary said.
The consequences are likely to be heightened in areas that are already underserved, and where birth outcomes are worse: rural parts of the country, and, in particular, large swaths of the South.
“While we are concerned about the impact the bill will have on all hospital services, we are particularly concerned about its impact on labor and delivery services,” said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
Already, rural areas have seen access to reproductive care dwindling, particularly in the past three years, since the fall of Roe v. Wade allowed states to outlaw abortion. Preliminary data shows that medical residents for OBGYN are applying in smaller numbers to states with abortion bans and a recent study in the medical journal JAMA, the first to assess the relationship between abortion bans and provider availability, found that in Idaho, the number of OBGYNs fell by 35 percent between August 2022 — when the state implemented its near-total ban — and December 2024.
Abortion ban states, which are largely in the South, also have higher rural populations, worse birth outcomes, and larger shares of hospitals at risk of closure.
“It’s an additional trend — on top of this piece of the general financial pressure  — that’s going to also affect predominantly rural Southern communities,” Daw said. “It seems like a perfect storm of these concurrent trends really really affecting access to care.”
If hospitals reduce their pregnancy-related offerings, few alternatives will be able to fill in the gap. Earlier this year, the Trump administration began withholding millions of dollars in family planning grants through Title X, the federal program that supports family planning services for low-income people. Planned Parenthood, a major provider of services that include cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and contraception, is also one of the largest Title X providers. Most Planned Parenthood clinics are in rural or otherwise medically underserved areas. The federal budget and tax law also includes a provision that would cut federal Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, though that policy has since been blocked by a federal court ruling. In recent weeks, several clinics have announced their plans to close.
“You have to think of them as related,” Daw said. “It’s definitely not helpful to have all of these changes happening at the same time and really undermining the safety net for reproductive-aged women.”
Cochran-McClain said when a provider with a background in obstetrics care leaves a rural town or city, that impacts health services more broadly: Often, that provider was also providing contraception, general gynecological care and routine screenings.
“It’s so interconnected. While we’re talking specifically about labor, delivery, and pregnancy, it can have an impact more broadly on access to women’s health in rural communities,” she said. “It’s been a rough couple of years before all of this, so it just feels like it’s a worsening trend in terms of overall access.”
The closure at Research Medical Center in Kansas City — where its obstetrics program is scheduled to close down in early September — also shows that even when a person in a rural area is forced to travel greater distances into a city setting for specialized care, those services aren’t guaranteed.
Wheat and other affected nurses at Research Medical Center, where they are represented by National Nurses United, said HCA Midwest Health has not provided enough information about the logistics of winding down services. Will the rest of the hospital, including its ICU unit, take emergency patients who need labor and delivery services? Or will the remaining staff in other areas of the hospital get specialized training?
HCA Midwest Health, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The 19th, said in a statement to a media outlet that it is working with area health providers to ensure patients have other delivery options.
Wheat has lined up another nursing job in labor and delivery with a different hospital system. In her text group chats with other impacted staff, there is a sense of sadness. She believes the obstetrics-related health providers will find other work, even if it means even more gas mileage to get to a new job. But Wheat keeps thinking about what’s to come for the patients.
“I’m emotionally exhausted. It is hard,” she said. “We’re just grieving for the community at this point, because we know they’re going to have a lot of issues after we’re gone.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pregnancyrural-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 04:56:17.480358

State Reps. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, and Christine Cockley, D-Columbus, recently introduced Ohio House Bill 399. 
The bill would prohibit the director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources from issuing a permit that would remove oil or natural gas from under a state park or Lake Erie. 
“Protecting our environment is just a critically important thing,” Rader said. “I think protecting our public lands, conserving the space we’ve already decided should be conserved, is actually a pretty salient idea.”
“Who’s gonna want to move here?” How fracking around Ohio’s Salt Fork State Park is changing area

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law in 2023 that allowed fracking for natural gas in Ohio’s public lands and state parks. Since then, fracking has begun in Salt Fork State Park, the state’s largest state park. 
“I think the natural progression of where we’re headed next is drilling in state parks,” Rader said. “So my goal is to try to stop that at all costs. Let’s actually do what we set out to do, and preserve these lands, instead of extracting from them, farming them, destroying these habitats.”
There have been approximately 2,000 incidents associated with oil and gas wells in Ohio over the past eight years, according to FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit that collects data on fracking pipelines. 
Ohio has 76 state parks that are managed by ODNR. 
“Our state park network is just so phenomenal,” Rader said. “We own a lot of lands as a state that’s conserved for various reasons.”
Lake Erie 
Federal law prohibits drilling in the Great Lakes and Rader said he thinks it’s important to “have some state protections to layer on top of some of these federal protections.” 
“I think redundancy, right now, when it comes to federal law is incredibly important, especially when you see an administration that is absolutely gung ho and drilling in all places, and doesn’t seem to really respect federal law very directly, and is willing to either go to court or ignore courts,” Rader said. 
Ohio Oil and Gas Association President Rob Brundrett said he is unaware of interest in drilling under Lake Erie. 
“We have not seen much interest from our members over the years to explore Lake Erie,” he said. “However, we do believe there could be a potential benefit in the exploration and production from the Great Lakes.”
Drilling in Lake Erie could pose risks to the drinking water and wildlife, including millions of walleye, Rader said.  
“Oil wells, oil drilling, (and) oil pipelines have a high risk of adding all kinds of toxins, whether it’s from the brines they use or spills that happen all too often,” he said. “I want to try my best as a human being to leave this planet better than where I found it, and part of that is keeping our lakes and streams and green spaces free of pollution.”
Environmentalists fear Lake Erie fracking, oil and gas industry says not to worry

This is not the first time a bill like this has been introduced. Former Democratic state Rep. Mike Skindell introduced a similar bill in 2023 during the last General Assembly that would have prevented fracking under Lake Erie, but the bill only received sponsor testimony. 
Rader is hopeful his bill will get a couple of hearings and maybe a vote, but as a Democratic bill in a Republican-controlled Statehouse, the cards are stacked against H.B. 399.
“Of course it’s Ohio, I’m not holding my breath,” Rader said. “But without putting the idea forward, without having the bill in, you don’t have that chance. So that’s what we’re doing.”
Protecting the planet should be a partisan issue, Rader said. 
“I think there are some folks on both sides of the aisle that think this is actually pretty important,” he said. “I think conservation is a concept that’s pretty core to conservatism, actually, as well as liberalism. It’s something that I do think we’ll get some buy in.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story)Ohio U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has joined President Donald Trump in asking for tech giant Intel’s CEO to resign due to his reported ties to the Chinese government.
Moreno has also asked for a fraud investigation into Intel’s continued delays on the state’s long-awaited semiconductor manufacturing plant.
Ohio’s multi-billion-dollar semiconductor manufacturing plant has faced delay after delay after delay, and was supposed to be operational by now.
“It was an unrealistic expectation that they would be producing chips in the summer of 2025,” Dorsey Hager with the Columbus/Central Ohio Building Trades Council said last Thursday.
That’s thousands of construction jobs stalled, ones that Hager said Intel promised when they broke ground at the central Ohio construction site in 2022.
“They talked about ramping up to close to 8,000 construction workers at the peak,” Dorsey said. “We have close to 1,200 people out there right now.”
That’s also hundreds of millions of Ohio taxpayer dollars that state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, says are being unused by Intel.
“We’re never getting the jobs we were promised, we’re never getting the economic development we were promised,” DeMora said. “All that’s happened is we spent a lot of state money on infrastructure, drove up property rates for all the people that live there, and now we’ve got a boondoggle.”
After years of the company’s stock plummeting, plus repeated layoffs, the company moved its expected completion date from 2025 to the 2030s.
Still, Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel said he believes Intel will stay true to its original promise of the multi-billion-dollar investment.
“Nothing’s easy, especially in a changing industry like the one they’re in, but they’ve already made a lot of investment and they’re still working on it,” Tressel said Thursday.
Asked about Ohio taxpayer money being spent on something that doesn’t exist yet, Tressel said that’s fair and frustrating for sure.
“We have contractual things that have to be met, I don’t think those are for a couple more years, but I understand the frustration,” he responded. “Big things are hard; sometimes the progress doesn’t happen like you’d like it to.”
Another issue is causing concern among other Republicans.
Both U.S. Sens. Jon Husted and Moreno have raised concerns about the new Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. This year, Tan invested hundreds of millions in Chinese companies that have ties to their government, according to a report by Reuters.
President Donald Trump and Moreno have asked for Tan to resign, and Moreno said that the project needs to be completed, “and a fraud investigation should be initiated.”



Husted, who has been the face of Intel in Ohio since he helped bring it to the state when he was lieutenant governor, took a softer approach.



“Obviously, if someone’s a part of the CCP, it’s a problem in my mind, but I think you have to be fair until facts come out,” Tressel said.
Gov. Mike DeWine, to reporters in Dayton, echoed his second-in-command’s thoughts.
“We are always very careful who the state deals with. Anybody who is associated with the Communist Party in China — that’s a problem. We don’t trust them, we don’t like them, they’re not good,” DeWine said. “I think we have to wait, though, in this case to see what the facts are.”
DeWine referenced how “we” have not heard from Intel about this matter, he said.
“I’m sure that Intel does not, would not want to be associated with someone, and we wouldn’t want them associated with someone who would be close to the Communist Party in China, but we don’t know that for a fact at this point, so I’m going to reserve judgment on that,” he said.
We reached out to Intel, but it didn’t respond directly to us. The company released the following statement to the public later in the day:

“Intel, the Board of Directors, and Lip-Bu Tan are deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests and are making significant investments aligned with the President’s America First agenda. Intel has been manufacturing in America for 56 years. We are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country, and are the only company investing in leading logic process node development in the U.S. We look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration.”

However, its spokesperson has told us for years that their commitment to Ohio remains strong. Hager is keeping with that optimism, but DeMora doesn’t believe it’s happening.
“Intel is dead,” he said. “We’re never going to see Intel.”
DeWine said the state won’t be able to claw back money from the state’s investment in the Intel project until at least 2029.
“On January 1, 2029 is the time when we look back and we see ‘did they produce the jobs when they said they were going to do or not,’ but up until then, the contract does not provide any remedy for the state,” the governor said Thursday. “I remain confident that Intel is going to be making chips in Ohio.”

Arroyo revealed city police investigated her citizenship status and required her to prove her citizenship. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)There’s a word for what happened to Lenexa City Council member Melanie Arroyo, and it begins with an “r” and ends with “ism.”
Go ahead. Take a wild guess.
Arroyo was forced to prove her citizenship to city police after someone left a voicemail with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. We subsequently learned that the KBI deleted the message after informing local law enforcement of its contents. That could well conflict with document retention rules, but let’s save that for later. Instead, let’s scrutinize what the statewide crime-fighting agency told Lenexa police via email.
Their words suggest that Kansas has a long way to go in treating residents respectfully and equally.
According to a KBI agent, a man “called with a question regarding the citizenship of a member of the Lenexa City Council. He stated that in February of 2025 Melanie Arroyo (possibly Melanie Arroyo-Lopez), a representative for Ward 3, gave testimony wanting to give illegals more benefits. During this testimony she acknowledged that she came to this country illegally as a child, but never acknowledged naturalization. He stated that this testimony was posted to the internet. He stated that to be a qualified elector, they had to be registered to vote and be born here or naturalized. He wanted to report this information for investigation.”
Big problems come to mind immediately. Namely that the KBI has passed along a bunch of patently false information.
Not a good look for the agency we depend on to keep Kansans safe.
First off, Arroyo’s full last name is Arroyo Pérez, not Arroyo-Lopez. Those two names actually sound quite different!
Secondly, “gave testimony wanting to give illegals more benefits” patently misstates Arroyo’s testimony. She argued for the continuation of current Kansas policy, not extending or expanding any policy.
Third, the email states that Arroyo “came to this country illegally as a child” based on her legislative testimony. That’s also untrue. She writes that she grew up as an undocumented migrant, but that doesn’t mean she or her family entered the United States illegally. Indeed, in a Kansas City Star op-ed published March 6, Arroyo notes that she came here legally but overstayed a visa.
Finally, the email claims that she “never acknowledged naturalization.” Actually, both the testimony and column state that her undocumented status had been “resolved.”
To summarize, the information that the KBI forwarded to the Lenexa Police Department contains four factual errors. These aren’t the kind of mistakes that take time or effort to uncover, either. You literally just have to read Arroyo’s actual words, as submitted to lawmakers and as published in the region’s newspaper of record.
Did no one at the KBI do this?
Did no one on the Lenexa police force do this?
If not, why?
Taken as a whole, I see clear signs of racism. You can see it in the confusion of last names. You can see it in the use of the word “illegals.” You can see it in the automatic assumption that anyone who looks a certain way, sounds a certain way, comes from a particular background, necessitates scrutiny. As I wrote last week, there’s just as much reason to ask Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach about his citizenship status. (That is, none.)
State and local law enforcement also failed to think critically. Ponder this: Would a Lenexa resident of distinction — a city council member, no less — give public testimony about benefits for undocumented Kansans and not have her own papers in order? Officers were asked to believe Arroyo was somehow willing to risk prison time, removal from office and deportation just so she could voice her opinion on a proposed bill.


That doesn’t pass the smell test. It’s bias, plain as day.


The KBI and the Lenexa police force probably didn’t set out with a explicit intention of harming Arroyo. Yet they did not give her the benefit of the doubt, either. They did not consider publicly available sources. They did not treat the recorded words from a “Johnson County man” with the appropriate amount of skepticism or critical thought. They decided that shaming a public official made more sense than questioning their own motives.
Take it from your friendly neighborhood journalist. Public officials in Kansas need to do a better job of checking their sources.

Mike DeWine’s veto of a line in the state budget that would ban certain types of levies from being put on the ballot by local governments or school districts.
The reason House members thought this was so important that they needed to get together and have this vote even when their chamber was closed for renovation was because they saw this as a way to reduce the burden of property taxes.
In the wake of COVID-19, global supply chain disruption, a contraction of building materials, and changes in demographics caused substantial shifts in housing supply. 
Many in Ohio have seen the value of their home increase precipitously in the years since 2020, especially in 2022-2024. 
With three-year valuations coming in, many were hit with sticker shock of their new property taxes, and state lawmakers leapt into their fighting stances, ready to find a way to reduce the impact of property taxes on households.
The Ohio General Assembly commissioned a committee to study ways to reduce the burden of property taxes. This led to a series of provisions in the new state budget trying to reduce the burden of property taxes in the state.
The provision that was vetoed and the focus of the Ohio House override is focused on a specific type of levy: an emergency or replacement levy. 
This is still a levy that has to go before voters, the same way any other property tax levy does. 
The argument made by House members on the floor was that by banning the use of the phrase “emergency” or “replacement,” voters would not be “tricked” into voting for property taxes they didn’t believe in.
So basically, the diagnosis here is that property taxes are so burdensome, at least partially, because people mistakenly vote for them.
Ultimately, these sorts of policy changes to the property tax system will do little to reduce the burden of property taxes. 
Yes, legislators can now go to their constituents and say “Hey, I went out there and voted even as the House chamber was under renovation to deliver property tax relief to you.” 
But these are small administrative changes to the types of property taxes that are being put before voters. They will do little to reduce the burden of property taxes.
It is worth asking the bigger question: are property taxes really the problem residents of Ohio are struggling with? 
Or is the real problem that property taxes grew in a short period of time relative to incomes? 
Because that is unlikely to happen again soon with interest rates high and the global supply chain for building materials at a new equilibrium. 
There is good reason to believe that legislators are stuck fighting the last war around property taxes.
So what can policymakers do? 
They can improve upon the system by moving from a property tax to a land value tax, which falls less heavily on low-income renters and does not penalize people for developing their land. 
They can invest in programs like early childhood and K-12 education which improve incomes in the long-run or the earned income tax credit and child tax credit which would improve incomes in the short-run.
Or they can keep beating around the bush, making small changes to the property tax system that do little more than to complicate an already-complicated system.

When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

Those go to U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., who faced a hostile crowd at an in-person town hall meeting last week in Lincoln. 
From my seat in the back of beautiful Kimball Hall on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s City Campus, the gathering did not disappoint. Nor — without mentioning names but their initials are Adrian Smith, Don Bacon and Deb Fischer — would Flood’s experience do anything but dissuade other Nebraska electeds to take the hot seat. To wit: The guy deserves an attaboy.
  Nebaska U.S. Rep Mike Flood talking to attendees before his town hall at lincoln on Aug 4. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)
Before we get carried away, however, whatever information exchange he or the throng hoped for never materialized. Such is the nature of the modern political in-person town hall. Some peg the beginning of these boisterous beasts to 2009, when conspiracy theorists started showing up at town halls, shouting about President Obama’s birth certificate. The noise and the lie persisted at town halls and among true believers. Then we elected one president. Twice.
While the data dissemination at the Flood’s town hall was disappointing, clear from the outset was that he is all in with the president and MAGA — unremarkable, given Flood’s voting record. Any sense that we’d have a meeting of the minds or a parsing of policies was a long shot.
Nevertheless, several of Flood’s answers and comments were instructive as much for what they didn’t say as for what they did.
He stumbled out of the blocks when he began by suggesting that perhaps some Nebraskans may be misinformed about the Big Ugly, for which he unsurprisingly voted yes. While he cleared up the difference between Medicaid and Medicare for the three people there who didn’t understand it, his implication that the Big Ugly had nothing to do with Medicare runs contrary to the Center for Medicare Advocacy, which should know.
At least five times he said that the bill “saved Medicaid,” inexplicably equating increased funding for state hospitals and work requirements for Medicaid recipients as solving the loss of health care for 78,000 Nebraskans. 
Few in the assembly bought that calculus, their boos reaching quite a crescendo. With no number on which to hang his hat, he also contended that apparently large numbers of Medicaid recipients who could work were government cheats, lolling at home and getting free health care. 
Curious, I checked three different analyses, finding the percent of able-bodied adults on Medicaid who could work but didn’t in the 5%-8% range.
On Gaza, Flood was clear. “I stand with Israel.” Before he repeated that sentiment, he referenced the horrors Hamas visited on Israelis and that no one likes watching children suffer. Missing was what’s missing in too much of the war’s public discourse: that one can support Israel’s right to defend itself but be critical of its prosecution of the war, including the moral imperative it now faces while Palestinians dodge aerial assaults and starve to death, and be neither an anti-Semite nor a supporter of Hamas. 
Both can be true and, as the war continues unabated, the distinction grows ever more pertinent.

The town hall was held before news that the feds are considering Nebraska as a site for one of its immigrant detention camps, an incredibly bad idea. Nevertheless, Flood was enthusiastic in his support of the president’s immigration policies and completion of a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, insisting we detain and deport violent criminals and stanch the flow of fentanyl into the country. 
Great, except most data confirms that among those now detained, 65-70% have no criminal record, and less than one in ten are violent criminals. Plus, most fentanyl, 80-90%, comes across our border at legal crossing points.
One other lowlight was ironically glaring. Flood said of the president firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics director because he didn’t like the jobs report, that “there are always two sides to every story.” Really? This is the same BLS Flood and his GOP posse used during the creation of and argument for the Big Ugly.
Finally, in answering a query about why the administration is withholding medical science funds from major research universities, Flood pledged his support for such endeavors at both private and public institutions, adding that some of schools “have a poor record of anti-semitism.” To which one might ask … such as?
As in-person town halls go, Flood’s Lincoln soiree was louder and more raucous than most. The real test for those in Kimball Hall and like-minded Flood constituents in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, however, is to turn up at the only place louder than a town hall meeting: the ballot box.

Too many fish.
Our damn fish.
For 450 million years, the sharks have had everything their way, swimming around the ocean like they own the place, chowing down on that endless seafood buffet.
Who do those sharks think they are? Other than, like, sharks.
We celebrate George Washington and Abraham Lincoln one lousy day a year.
Sharks get a whole week.
  U.S. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. (U.S. Senate website)
No más. Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott means to show these arrogant top predators he means business.
Sen. Scott’s elegantly named and creatively capitalized “Supporting the Health of Aquatic systems through Research, Knowledge, and Enhanced Dialogue (or SHARKED) Act will address bad behavior in the shark community. 
No longer will the sharks be allowed to appropriate fish for their own selfish nutritional ends.
It’s a bipartisan effort: Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat, is Scott’s SHARKED co-sponsor, although he’s being cautious about what he says.
Schatz is from Hawaii, where certain sharks are considered sacred, what with them being people’s reincarnated ancestors.
Funnily enough, Schatz was once part of the shark-coddling caucus, all-in on legislation to protect those deep sea devils.
But he’s clearly seen the light, read the room, and smelled the Trumpy zeitgeist: It’s all about the money.
Sport fishing in Hawaii is worth hundreds of millions.
Scott also once expressed a bit of sympathy for sharks.
When he saw images of boaters “abusing a young tiger shark in Citrus County,” he wrote a tough letter to the head of NOAA demanding somebody do something.
The senator still wants somebody to do something, and, by God, the Scott-Schatz bill is going to do it.
More or less.
‘Unnatural food source’
It directs the secretary of commerce to put together a task force to figure out why elasmobranch cartilaginous fishes (as ichthyology nerds call them) gobble up the very fish sportsmen and women spend so much cash to catch.
You drop big money on a three-day charter out of Destin, spend another grand on your Yeti cooler, your Bora Bora hat, your Columbia convertible pants, your Coors, your Jack, your Pringles, your Publix subs, your peanut M&Ms, you finally get something on the line, but next thing you know, Mister Jerk Shark smells the blood in the water, swims up, and takes a big old bite of your 400 lb. blue marlin.  
OK, maybe the shark was hungry, but that’s no excuse.
The American Sportfishing Association, the American Fisheries Society, and others rightly upset about sharks’ indefensible habit of consuming their usual source of protein, complain “shark depredation is clearly detrimental to anglers and predated fish that would otherwise be released.”
They point out all that illicit predation “creates an unnatural food source for sharks.”
The sharks would argue fish are, in fact, their entirely natural food source, but if it comes to a choice between those toothy behemoths and a $230 billion industry, the sharks lose.
Enviros whine about declining shark populations, pointing lefty fingers at all-American events such as Alabama’s Deep Sea Rodeo which is all about killing the biggest shark you can find.
Bottom line: Sharks are hurting the economy.
Scott has principles.
These principles, largely devoted to profit, were amply on display in a Senate committee the other day when he waxed passionate — practically Shakespearean — about the sacredness of unfettered capitalism.
Capitalism
Fellow Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley had the brass-faced gall to put forth a bill banning members of Congress from trading stocks and forcing them to divest by the beginning of their next term.
How are our elected representatives supposed to get rich if you deny them all that sweet insider information?
Scott accused Hawley of attacking Donald Trump, who, as he put it, “has gone through unbelievable hell.”
Too right: The president has been forced to suffer impertinent press questions about his pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein, disrespectful comments on his cheating at golf, and a painful lack of gold leaf in the Cabinet room.
A lesser man would have crumbled. 
But Hawley’s real ire was directed at Florida’s senior senator. He said, pointedly, “I’m not a billionaire, unlike others on this committee.”
Stung, shocked, affronted, even, Rick Scott hit back: “I don’t know when in this country it became a negative to make money. This idea that we’re going to attack people because they make money is wrong. It’s absolutely wrong.” 
Damn straight, senator: Money isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.
When they start picking on the super-rich, everybody might as well start singing “The Internationale” and pledge allegiance to the hammer and sickle.          
Just because Rick Scott’s worth at least $500 million (probably more — some of his wealth is in his wife’s name) is no reason to be mean. 
Scott will be the first, second, and probably third to tell you he grew up in public housing and in the early 1970s enlisted in the United States Navy, serving on a ship that sailed to danger zones such as Bermuda (when it wasn’t in dry dock), selling soft drinks at a huge mark-up to his fellow sailors.
Nothing more American than price-gouging!
Unless it’s big money sport fishing.
Shark chow?
So, what are we going to do to stop those sharks from snatching our fish, robbing us of the pleasure of shooting the breeze with the guys, drinking beer on a big boat, and finally piercing some fishy cheeks with metal hooks?
As former Louisiana U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, a supporter of the bill, describes it, when the shark bites a fish on somebody’s line, it’s like “the tax collector taking more off the top.”
Spit-balling here, but how about alternative shark food sources? 
If humans can learn to eat tofu, sharks can learn to eat things that aren’t fish.
Let’s get some business buy-in. Purina makes deer chow, goat chow, rabbit chow, chicken chow, sheep chow, pig chow, and cow chow.
It even makes food for large-mouth bass: Surely it can’t be that hard to manufacture shark chow.
The feds could hire a bunch of deadbeat Medicaid recipients to buzz around on the sea with great big shakers, sprinkling the shark chow onto the water — just like you do with your home aquarium.
Woke scientist types are always telling us sharks are not mindless killers like that nasty thing in “Jaws.”
In fact, they’re smart.
So maybe we could reason with them.
Find a way to communicate: It’s possible those military dolphins can speak shark. The dolphins could inform them we’re serious about our sport fish and they’d better back off.
The problem with this plan is sharks eat dolphins.
A modest proposal
If persuasion doesn’t work, there’s always firearms.
Shoot enough of them when you catch them chomping down on somebody else’s catch, and the greedy bastards will get the message.
Or what if we could solve two problems at once: the illegal immigrant thing and the shark thing?
How about we dig two deep canals, one from the Gulf of God Bless ‘Merka heading east from Chokoloskee; one from the Mar-at-Lantic heading west from Fort Lauderdale?
The canals meet at the Big Cypress detention camp, making a saltwater moat all the way around.
Stock the moat with sharks. Pen them in with big gates. 
Once the illegals realize there are 20-foot great hammerheads and 500-pound bull sharks swimming around and around, they’ll stop demanding to speak to their lawyers.
The sharks get fed, the illegals stay in jail — at least until they get sent to Sudan or Nicaragua or wherever.
Win-win.
Sport fishing — indeed, America herself — is saved.

Andy Beshear (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT, Ky. – Gov. Andy Beshear’s super PAC reported another $824,800 in contributions on Friday bringing the total it raised in the first six months of this year to $1,443,000.
The largest of the contributions by far was $225,000 from Andrew Nathan Schwartzberg, a real estate developer based in Maryland who focuses on affordable housing projects.
Beshear created his super PAC, called In This Together PAC, soon after winning re-election in 2023. Beshear is prevented by the Kentucky Constitution from seeking a third term as governor, and the super PAC is a mechanism that allows him to raise money to promote political candidates and issues in Kentucky and across the country while he considers a possible candidacy for president in 2028.
The report filed on Friday with the Internal Revenue Service shows the super PAC gave significant support in the past six months to candidates in other states. It spent $143,568 in March for direct mail supporting Susan Crawford’s successful campaign for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Crawford was the candidate favored by Democrats in that hotly-contested race that determined control of the Wisconsin high court. Also in March, In This Together donated $25,000 to Copper State Values, a PAC that supports Democrat Katie Hobbs, the governor of Arizona.
In This Together is a hybrid super PAC that can accept contributions of unlimited amounts and accept contributions from corporations. It discloses some of its financial activity to the Federal Election Commission and the rest to the Internal Revenue Service.
Early last week, In This Together filed its report with the FEC covering the first half of this year – a disclosure reported by Kentucky Lantern and other news outlets. On Friday it filed its report covering the same period with the IRS allowing a comprehensive look at its activity over the period.
The reports combined show roughly $1,443,000 in contributions, and $558,400 in spending between Jan. 1 and June 30.
The total reflects a slight increase in the pace of contributions over last year when In This Together reported raising $2.56 million over 12 months.
The vast percentage of the money taken in by In This Together so far this year came in big contributions from a small number of people, and several of the largest donors are real estate developers.
Here is a list of its largest donors during the period as listed in the report filed Friday.

Andrew Nathan Schwartzberg, Rockville, Maryland, $225,000. Schwartzberg is president of Preservation Services LLC, a national real estate development business focusing on affordable housing. The report lists his address in Maryland. Last year he gave $250,000 to In This Together. The total of $475,000 makes him the largest donor ever to In This  Together.
Maegan Ford Nicholson, $100,000. The report lists a Dallas, Texas, address and does not list an occupation. But Nicholson is listed with a Versailles address, and identified as an executive with Diamond A Farm, in a contribution she made to Beshear’s 2023 re-election campaign.
Christopher Dischinger, Louisville, developer, LGD Inc., $50,000.
Christian Larsen, San Francisco, executive chairman of Ripple Inc., $50,000.
John and Marcia Goldman, Atherton, California, not employed, $50,000.
Tracy W. Farmer, Naples, Florida, self-employed, $25,000. Though the report lists a Naples address, Farmer is a longtime businessman and horseman from central Kentucky and past donor to campaigns of Andy Beshear and Beshear’s father, former Gov. Steve Beshear.
James Gray, Lexington, secretary of Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, $25,000.
Morgan Chu, Los Angeles, lawyer with Irell Manella LLP, $25,000.

They should not get away with it.,"Connecticut’s Attorney General William Tong is suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from education, Planned Parenthood and disaster relief. He is also suing this adminstration for restricting health care to transgender youth. Whether these cases have merit remains to be seen.
But there is one group that Tong has so far given a free pass: the private equity firms who ravaged Connecticut hospitals while enriching themselves with hundreds of millions of dollars.

Joseph Bentivegna MD
First some background. Prospect Medical Holdings is a private healthcare company that purchases hospitals “with a core mission to provide quality, compassionate, and accessible healthcare.”
In actuality, their goal is to buy hospitals, suck out the equity and pay investors and company executives gargantuan sums of money.
How did this happen? In 2010, a private equity group, Leonard Green and Partners, bought a 61% stake in Prospect Medical Holdings for $363 million and assumed their $158 million debt. They then went on a rampage, buying hospitals across the country. In Connecticut, they purchased Manchester Memorial Hospital and Rockville Hospital for $105 million and Waterbury Hospital for an undisclosed amount.
These hospitals owned the land and buildings in which they were housed. But Prospect Medical Holdings sold this property along with that of other hospitals across the country for $1.4 billion to a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) called Medical Properties Trust (MPT). Thus, the hospitals now had a huge expense they did not have before, monthly rent. Meanwhile, Leonard Green and Partners used Prospect Medical Holdings as the conduit to receive the money for these land purchases along with the cash flow from the hospital to borrow $1.1 billion. They paid off previous debts and then the executives of these companies took obscene salaries.
The Prospect Medical Holdings CEO Sam Lee took home $128 million! Leonard Green and Partners, the majority owner of Prospect Medical Holdings, received $658 million in dividends and management fees during its ownership of the hospital chain. While there are no public disclosures on how much the executives of Leonard Green and Partners pocketed, there are two managing partners, Jonathan Sokoloff and John G. Danhakl. Sokoloff’s net worth is estimated to be $150 million (although it is probably much higher) and Danhakl is worth a cool $1.7 billion. It’s safe to say these two each put at least $100 million in their pockets.
Meanwhile, the once-thriving 102-bed Rockland Hospital that served the working-class Vernon community now only offers an emergency room, one-day surgical service and behavioral health services. And at Manchester Memorial doctors have not been paid, nurses are short-staffed and working like dogs while Prospect Medical Holdings stopped funding their pensions.
And what happened when the staff tried to receive their compensation? If you said Prospect Medical Holdings declared bankruptcy, go to the head of the class!
So now what happens to these hospitals? Either some other conglomerate buys them, or they must close. Yale attempted to do so but no agreement could be reached. Prospect Medical Holdings’ bankruptcy caused two hospitals in the Philadelphia area to close and then patients had to pay $75 to get access to their records.
And it gets worse. Waterbury Hospital owes the Town of Waterbury $29 million in back taxes. But with Prospect Medical Holdings in bankruptcy, the taxpayers will get the bill.
And to add insult to injury, the bankruptcy judge approved an incentive program for six top executives, including undisclosed salary boosts, aimed at retaining key personnel during the hospital-sale process. Thus, the same people who raped the hospitals will generate huge fees by trying to sell the hospitals they destroyed. You can’t make this up.
Tong simply cannot allow this without a fight. Leonard Green and Partners must be sued along with Sokoloff, Danhakl and Lee personally – preferably in the Waterbury Courthouse.
The problem is that any lawyer reading this article, including Tong will say, “What these guys did may have been immoral, but it is not illegal. There is no case here.”
But perhaps with some creative legal thinking, a statute can be found or least possibly interpreted to mean that private equity firms cannot destroy the health care of working class communities so that their executives can buy bigger yachts.
Tong graduated from Phillips Academy, Brown University (with honors) and the University of Chicago Law School. Even if one does not agree with his politics, he must be a sharp guy. He should be able to figure out how to make a strong case while showcasing the malfeasance of these executives and letting a jury decide. Even the threat of a jury trial and the adverse publicity these executives will receive could cause them to settle for a large sum that could be used to improve health care in these communities.
And even if Tong does not win, he will become a hero to many voters outside of the Democratic bailiwick. Even hardcore Republicans are disgusted by the behavior of these plutocrats. The destruction of community hospitals by avaricious private equity executives who game the system cannot go unchallenged.

The newly rechristened Storis, formerly the oilfield supply ship Aiviq, is the first in a series of icebreakers expected to join the Coast Guard in coming years. The Storis and subsequent ships, officials said, are critical for the United States to maintain its sovereignty and control of its borders in and near the Arctic Ocean. 
“What we’re doing here today is we’re really just preparing to build our Arctic fighting force,” said Troy Edgar, deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, parent agency of the Coast Guard.

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was one of several members of Congress who secured funding for the Coast Guard to purchase the Storis for $125 million under a special contract and operating arrangement during the Biden administration. The purchase deal passed Congress after years of lobbying and political donations by the ship’s former owners.
The Aiviq, built to support Royal Dutch Shell’s oil drilling operations in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska, was available because of a disaster that saw Shell’s drilling rig break loose from the Aiviq during a 2013 storm in the Gulf of Alaska. The rig ran aground in the Kodiak archipelago and Shell abandoned its drill plans for the Arctic. 
The Aiviq was modified after post-disaster reviews found flaws in its design, and it went on to serve under contract with the Australian government in Antarctica. Then, the U.S. government became interested in the ship to fill a gap in Arctic coverage.
The U.S. Navy has no icebreakers, which leaves the Coast Guard as the agency in charge of icebreaking operations, critical for opening frozen seas to commerce, research and military missions. The agency currently has just one heavy icebreaker, and that ship is typically assigned to help operations in Antarctica. That leaves the medium icebreaker Healy as the only U.S. icebreaker available for general-purpose missions in the Arctic. 
A 2023 analysis by the Coast Guard concluded that the service needs eight to nine polar icebreakers, including four or five heavy ships and four or five medium ones to perform its assigned missions.
“I think Singapore has more icebreaking capacity than we do,” Sullivan said. “That has left us far behind our adversaries. Russia has more than 50 operational icebreakers, many nuclear-powered, many weaponized. China, which has no Arctic territory, is building a polar fleet and is spending a lot of time off our shores, including this summer.”

As Sullivan spoke, China is operating at least five research icebreakers in international waters near Alaska.
Capt. Corey Kearns is the ship’s first commanding officer, fresh from an assignment in Japan as a liaison officer with the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.
“For the Coast Guard, the big strategic thing is to show that we can operate it, get it up north, show the flag,” Kearns said.
During his time in Japan, he became familiar with the disputes over the Senkaku Islands, whose ownership is disputed among China, Taiwan and Japan.
Ships from all three nations visit the waters around those islands.
“The ability to be present guarantees your ability to to maintain sovereignty. And that’s what we’re trying to get at here in the Arctic. We need more icebreakers to be present in our waters and be clear what is our waters,” he said.
First of many icebreakers planned for Coast Guard
In January, President Donald Trump said he would seek to acquire 40 Coast Guard icebreakers. The “Big Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July included almost $9 billion to build a series of heavy, medium and light ships.
Those include a series of heavy Arctic icebreakers larger than the Storis. The first of those, the Polar Sentinel, is expected to come from Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in 2030, with additional ships every two years afterward.
“This is an amazing moment, because it doesn’t happen that often, but it’s going to be happening a lot more,” said acting Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Kevin E. Lunday.

The Storis is scheduled to be homeported in Juneau, where Sunday’s commissioning took place, but not for several years. For the time being, it will be homeported in Seattle, Washington. 
Sullivan, speaking at the commissioning, said he would like to see the new ships homeported in Alaska as well — it’s where the ice is, he said to applause.
The Trump-signed budget measure includes $300 million for a new Coast Guard pier and other facilities in Juneau; construction has not begun, and no site has been finalized.
Both the Storis and the under-construction heavy icebreakers are too large to fit in the Coast Guard’s Kodiak base or in any port north of the Aleutian Islands. The Storis draws 34 feet, according to specifications published in 2013. The new heavy icebreakers are expected to have a similar draft. Either figure is deeper than what’s available in northern Alaska right now.
By the book, said Cmdr. Philip Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, it takes the Coast Guard eight to 10 years to set up a new port from the time it’s chosen.
“We want to move much faster, but there’s a lot of work that has to be done to build out the pier and the shore infrastructure,” Lunday said.
He said things like housing and child care need to be available to accommodate Coast Guard personnel.
Currently, Juneau is experiencing major shortages of both.
“I chair the Coast Guard subcommittee,” Sullivan said, “so working with the Coast Guard, working with Juneau, working with the state, we’re going to press this. We’ve already made good progress on that.”
Additional work needed aboard Storis
The Storis, too, will need work and testing before it can fully perform its duties. During a pre-commissioning cruise on Saturday for members of the media and the families of the crew, one of the ship’s variable-pitch propellers malfunctioned, helping turn a planned five-hour excursion into an eight-hour one. 
The malfunction was a minor one, but fixing it may have required turning off main power for a time, the ship’s captain said, and he didn’t want to do that while families were aboard.
The Storis has a helipad, but a Coast Guard helicopter has never landed there, tried a mid-air hoist, or refueled from the ship. Some labels throughout the ship still bear the name Aiviq, and the ship’s interior art includes photos from Louisiana bayous and New Orleans streets. In the ship’s mess hall are condiments bearing the names of southern grocery stores.

On Saturday’s cruise, employees from Edison Choest Offshore, the company that formerly owned the Storis, stood alongside uniformed Coast Guard officers on the ship’s bridge.
“He’s my coach,” said Lt. j.g. Sophia Scott of chief mate Devin Keister, who wore civilian clothes next to her. 
Since the spring, employees from Edison Choest have been operating the Storis alongside enlisted Coast Guard members and officers, a unique setup for a Coast Guard ship.
Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, helped organize the purchase of the Storis and the sprint to get it ready.
“I’ll never forget March 4 of 2025 when Admiral Lunday, our acting Commandant of the Coast Guard, directed me and my team to prepare Storis for operations and to sail away from Pascagoula, Mississippi, where the ship had been purchased and put into storage, no later than 1 June of 2025. I’m no mathematician, but that’s less than 60 days later, and at that point, zero crew members had reported aboard,” he said.
After sailing away, the ship spent another two weeks in Seattle for additional work, then arrived in Juneau during the first week of August.
Lunday said the Coast Guard’s partnership with Edison Choest enabled the Coast Guard to put the Storis in service “much faster than we would have traditionally done.”
“The imperative,” Lunday said, “is that we build out the nation’s icebreaker fleet. When we see the potential adversaries that are moving to build their icebreakers, we’ve got to move faster as the United States, and we’re going to do that. … The original plan was not to have Storis up here for another year, but the national imperative was to move faster, and so that’s why it’s here.”
Storis has a mixed history
In 2012, while towing the circular drill rig Kulluk from the Arctic Ocean to Seattle, the Aiviq ran into a heavy storm south of Kodiak. The ship’s engines died, the tow line broke, and the Kulluk ran aground after the Aiviq’s crew was unable to re-establish the tow.
No oil spill resulted and no one was injured, but it contributed to Shell’s decision to abandon its Arctic drilling plans.
Two years later, the Coast Guard published a report on the accident, concluding that actions by the tow crew, management decisions and “design engineering deficiencies … relating to the Aiviq” contributed to the wreck.

Specifically, the report noted that vents allowed seawater to contaminate the ship’s fuel.
Since then, those vents have been modified, raised farther above the deck, and the ship went on to conduct two successful voyages to Antarctica. The ship is rated to break three feet of ice while moving at five knots, but during those trips, it was able to break between three and five feet while still moving forward, Baxa said.
After Shell discontinued its Alaska offshore drilling, Edison Choest lobbied members of Congress and urged lawmakers to purchase the Aiviq for use by the federal government.
The Coast Guard initially resisted. In a 2016 hearing of the U.S. House’s Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, then-Coast Guard Vice Commandant Charles Michel told lawmakers that “our current opinion is that the ship is not suitable for military service, without substantial refit.”
Then-Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, called Michel’s statement a “bulls**t answer” because the Aiviq would be asked to move ice, not perform military duties.
In 2022, after Young’s death in office, Congress passed the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act, which approved funding for the Coast Guard to buy a “United States built available icebreaker.”
The Coast Guard, which had been considering a Finland-built ship, switched to the Aiviq as the only available ship that met Congress’ qualifications. 
Subsequent reporting by ProPublica showed an extensive history of political donations by Edison Choest to members of Congress, including Alaska’s delegation.
“It is ready for Coast Guard service,” Lunday said of the Aiviq-turned-Storis when asked about the July 2016 hearing that labeled the Aiviq as unfit.
“We’ve learned a lot since then, and we’ve had great support from Congress to have the appropriations necessary last year to purchase the ship,” he said.
Sullivan, among the members of Congress who received contributions from Edison Choest, denied that those donations contributed to the decision to purchase the Aiviq.
“It has nothing to do with it,” Sullivan said. “Zero. I’ve been pressing for more icebreakers any way possible for our country … and the Coast Guard was looking at the idea of a commercially available one.”
New ship carries relics of prior history
The new Storis is named after its predecessor, an icebreaker that was commissioned in 1942 and served until 2007, becoming the oldest commissioned Coast Guard cutter in the fleet at the time of its decommissioning and scrapping.
In 1957, it and several other ships sailed through the Northwest Passage, marking the first time an American ship had taken that route.
Thirty-two years after that historic voyage, the Storis assisted with the cleanup after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Ed Sasser was a crewman on board at the time. On Saturday, he sailed aboard the new edition of his former ship.
“It’s pretty cushy compared to the old Storis,” he said, noting that both ships were and are unique vessels, not part of a larger class of ships.
If he were young again, he’d serve aboard the new ship “in a New York minute.”
“Time will tell how useful it is,” he said.

Remnants of the ship’s former life remain obvious throughout.
Belowdecks are large steel containers, intended to haul bulk dry concrete or other material to offshore oil fields. For now, they’re empty until the Coast Guard either removes them or finds a use for them. 
Other pieces of the Storis’ original purpose could be useful to its new mission. Its stern holds heavy-duty towing gear, and large firefighting cannons jut from its superstructure. 
The ship has no internal laboratory space, as does the Coast Guard’s other medium icebreaker, the Healy, but it does have deck attachments for container modules that could allow it to accommodate labs.
Already, one of those spaces was in use Sunday, holding the ship’s brand-new armory, including four .50-caliber machine guns. 
“I’ve made this joke for many, many years … it’s that if you can imagine it, and you can put it into a standard 20-foot IMO container, I can embark it on board. … we had on board a very, very senior Marine Corps officer, and he asked, ‘hey, what if I put a Marine Raider team in a box?’ I said, ‘Yes, sir, I can embark that on board.’ It really does provide that flexibility for missions,” Baxa said.
The Coast Guard’s staffing contract with Edison Choest is scheduled to run through November, and it could be extended for one year. 
Both Baxa and the ship’s captain said they’ll be recommending that extension.
Lt. Cmdr. George Greendyk, the engineer officer on board the Storis, said he hasn’t had problems with the Edison Choest civilian crew. 
“Everywhere we go, we have people that have seen something like this before, and they’ve been certainly helpful answering questions for us and guiding us as we run the engineering plant,” he said.
“Right now, our primary mission is to just focus on learning the ship, training, preparing our policy and procedures,” said Lt. D.J. Corbett, the ship’s operations officer.
Corbett said that over the next two months, the Storis will head west, to Kodiak, then through the Bering Sea and north, through the Bering Strait. The ship’s port calls are still being finalized. 
Corbett said being aboard an icebreaker means being able to see and do things that no other Coast Guard cutter experiences.
“I still remember the first time that I ever saw ice,” she said. “We were going down south. We had crossed the Antarctic Circle, and all of these massive icebergs just started flowing past us. And then we had right whales that were popping up and coming to see the ship. We had orcas. It was our last sunset. As we were heading south, it would be 24 hours of sunlight. So all of this was happening, the sun was setting, and then we saw a green flash that night. At first, we didn’t believe it. We were like, Did everyone see that? And so it was my moment of, I’m living in a National Geographic special. It was really amazing.”
The ship’s first captain looks ahead
Kearns, the ship’s first captain, is an officer who started as an enlisted man in 1996 and rose through the ranks, later earning degrees in ship design. He helped design a new class of icebreakers for the Great Lakes and served as the Coast Guard’s liaison to the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet, which patrols the western Pacific.

“Normally, you start off a ship designed by (the question): What capabilities are you trying to achieve? In this case, we need Arctic presence. That was the most important thing. So we’re willing to take some risk or we’re forced into it because our shipbuilding projects are so behind,” he said. 
Critically for the ship’s future, he said, is to come up with the equivalent of the ship’s operating manual. Coast Guard officers are trained to run ships, but the Storis is unique.
“What are all the things you need to learn to do the same job on Storis? And then run all of our people through that. … I think success will be when we get all of that documentation done and then get all of our watchstanders what would be considered fully qualified,” he said.
Kearns acknowledged that there are some people who would prefer that the Storis jump quickly into law enforcement, fisheries patrols and search and rescue. He prefers a slower pace.
“We need to learn how to crawl. And that’s what we’re doing, Kearns said.
For example, the crew of the Storis hasn’t yet launched the ship’s small craft, which are stored in bays along the side of the hull, in open water.
“We’ve just started to gain proficiency in launching that in protected, calm seas. So next would be, what does it look like to launch that in open water? And then how do we need to drive the ship from the bridge to create the right conditions to safely launch that boat? And then that would help us build into, ‘Oh, this is how we would  perform Coast Guard mission sets.’”
Asked about the ship’s history, the critical 2014 report and whether he has safety concerns, he said no.
“I have no concerns. I feel totally safe on Storis,” Kearns said.
He said he’s familiar with reporting that analyzed what went wrong with the Aiviq and why it was unable to keep the Kulluk from running aground.
“It easily gets attributed to design flaws for the ship, which is a little bit misleading. In extreme weather, every ship has design flaws. There’s constraints on operations. Ships are designed to operate in certain conditions to a certain extent, and if you operate the ship past those constraints, you’re going to find out what’s going to fail first,” he said.
Some engineering changes were made after the Kulluk accident — the Aiviq’s fuel vents were raised, “which means you can take more water in the vicinity of them before it would down-flood. It’s not that it couldn’t possibly happen again, but it’s less likely.”
Kearns said the “creature comforts” aboard the ship are the most easily noticeable difference from a purpose-built Coast Guard ship. 
The Storis has heated handrails, walkways and exterior stairs, a feature intended to eliminate the need for crew to beat ice away as it forms.
“There’s a lot of automation in places that we might not use it, because we use manpower instead,” he said.
Kearns said he’s also been impressed with the ship’s multiple redundancies.
“Almost every system has backups to the backups. They really thought about this thing being in the Arctic and independent and away from logistical support. There’s different ways to make water. There’s ways to handle sewage. I actually feel very comfortable with what the capabilities are,” he said.
“I’m definitely looking forward to doing ice breaking on this thing. It’s a lot of fun to drive,” Kearns said.
