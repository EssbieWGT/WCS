(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)The United States Department of Justice on Friday announced that it had filed a statement of interest in Enbridge Energy’s case against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. 
Whitmer pledged to shut down the Canadian energy company’s Line 5 pipeline as part of her 2018 campaign for governor.
In 2020, she ordered the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to revoke Enbridge’s permit to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, arguing the company had repeatedly violated the terms of the easement and that its continued operation within the Great Lakes carried an “unacceptable risk” for a catastrophic oil spill. 
In response, Enbridge filed a suit arguing the governor and the DNR hold no authority over pipeline safety, and that the move to shut down the pipeline was in violation of the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty with Canada concerning the flow of oil and natural gas through pipelines across borders. 
Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division raised similar arguments in a statement released Friday. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The federal government already comprehensively regulates pipeline safety, but Michigan is trying to usurp the Department of Transportation’s statutory authority,” Gustafson said. “President Trump has made clear that the United States will not tolerate state overreach that interferes with American energy dominance.”
In response to a recent motion from Enbridge, attorneys for Whitmer and DNR Director Scott Bowen argued the decision to revoke the company’s easement did not fall under the scope of the federal Pipeline Safety Act and the state’s actions are within the limits of the treaty. 
“Our office does not agree with the legal arguments articulated in this amicus brief,” said Danny Wimmer, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Attorney General, which is representing Whitmer and Bowen in the case. 
The attorney general’s office will respond to the Department of Justice in further detail, Wimmer said, with the state’s response due by Oct. 10. 
Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy said the company would “continue to protect and defend Line 5’s continued operations consistent with federal law, interstate commerce, and international treaty agreements,” reiterating the company’s argument about the Transit Pipelines Treaty.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2225265502.jpg,,,2025-09-22 14:58:18.252916

A bipartisan group of Vermont House members and hundreds of their counterparts from other states visited Israel last week on a trip sponsored by the Israeli government that comes as the Middle Eastern country is facing mounting international scrutiny over its war in Gaza.
Rep. Sarita Austin, D-Colchester; Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes; Rep. Gina Galfetti, R-Barre Town; Rep. Will Greer, D-Bennington; and Rep. James Gregoire, R-Fairfield, took part in the visit, which was called “50 States, One Israel,” according to interviews and social media posts. The visit ran from Monday, Sept. 15 to Thursday, Sept. 18.

Ørsted is co-developer of the Revolution Wind Farm off the Rhode Island coast. (Ørsted photo)Construction on the Revolution Wind offshore wind project off the coast of Rhode Island can resume, a federal judge in Washington D.C. ruled Monday.
Senior Judge Royce Lamberth granted the project developers’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Aug. 22 decision to abruptly halt construction of the 65-turbine project was “the height of arbitrary and capricious actions” and unsupported by any evidence of national security concerns.
“The Bureau does not point to any factual findings that lead them to believe Revolution Wind is implicated in either of these concerns or that those concerns rise to such a level that warrant work cease immediately,” Lamberth, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, said.
Monday’s ruling now means that work on the $5 billion project already 80% completed is expected to resume “as soon as possible” as the lawsuit progresses, according to a statement issued by Ørsted.
“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the US Administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” the statement read.
Lamberth’s decision came after a 90-minute hearing that was supposed to be accessible to the public via phone. But audio for the call cut out a little over two minutes into the hearing, just as Revolution Wind attorney Janice M. Schneider was making her opening argument.
“Following no process under statute or regulations, the government changed its position and suspended work on a previously-approved project at a critical stage of construction with no notice, no allegation of violation, no meaningful explanation, no consideration of Revolution Wind’s reliance interest, and no due process whatsoever,” Schneider said at around 11:09 a.m.
Lisa J. Klem, special assistant to the Chief Judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, acknowledged at 11:30 a.m. there was an “issue” with the audio and asked the court’s IT team to fix it without interrupting proceedings.
Audio resumed after 12:30 p.m., when Lamberth announced his decision finding that Revolution Wind is suffering “irreparable harm” as a result of the stoppage.
Danish developer Ørsted and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables filed the lawsuit against the Trump administration. Attorneys general for Rhode Island and Connecticut filed a similar lawsuit in federal court in Providence pointed at the Trump administration to restart construction — a case the federal government is asking be consolidated with the Revolution Wind lawsuit in D.C.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha in a statement said he believes Lamberth’s ruling will bode well for his case, which as of Monday has yet to be scheduled to go before Judge Mary S. McElroy.
“Today’s legal victory in Washington, D.C. reaffirms what we know to be true: this President cannot cancel clean energy projects just because he believes doing so is politically expedient for him,” Neronha said.
In court filings, the developers noted they were losing $2 million a day on work and equipment contracts. Lamberth warned that further delays could allow Rhode Island and Connecticut to terminate their power purchase agreements with the company.
“If Revolution Wind cannot meet benchmark deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse,” Lamberth said.

(Photo provided by National Park Service)In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency released a historic Endangerment Finding, which concluded that six greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution and endanger public health and well-being. This pollution is one of the key drivers of climate change, which can also result in more intense storms, increased drought and wildfires, and risks to human life.
The endangerment finding was reaffirmed in 2016, when the EPA finalized the rule for aircraft, stating that greenhouse gases from a variety of aircraft engines cause or contribute to air pollution that endanger public health and welfare. When these findings were released, it served as the legal and scientific basis for the EPA to issue regulations around emissions and other important health protections.  
On March 12, 2025, the Trump administration made a significant and divisive announcement regarding the endangerment finding: the EPA would be starting a formal reconsideration and potential repeal of the 2016 finding. When this announcement was made, the details were drowned out or under-reported by news media, which has led to a lack of understanding by many Americans and communities of its consequences. 
For Alaskans, the repeal of the endangerment finding will have vastly negative consequences. Without the regulation of pollutants contributing to climate change, Alaska will likely see an increase of intensity in coastal storms and wildfires. Famous storms, like Typhoon Merbok, and other severe weather events in Alaska serve as stark reminders of the devastating impacts of climate change. In a state where 82% of our communities can only be reached either by plane or boat, an increase in powerful storms puts our most vulnerable populations, including Alaskan Native communities, in danger.
If the EPA does proceed to roll back the endangerment finding, we will likely see a sharp decrease in regulations and legal protections, like the Clean Air Act, that protect the health of average Americans. If these protections are repealed, we could see a dramatic rise in adverse health outcomes. Currently, there are approximately 266 million people in the U.S. (8.2 percent of the population) who have asthma, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
There are around 60,000 Alaskans who suffer from asthma, which is the leading cause of school absenteeism and childhood emergency room visits, and is the fourth leading cause of work loss in adults. In 2021, eleven Alaskans died from complications due to asthma. Without regulations to ensure the air we breathe is pollutant-free, we are risking our families’ health.  
Alaskans have the opportunity to submit public comments to the EPA on the endangerment finding through September 22.
Whether a Democrat, a Republican – the health of this planet and your communities should be one of the most critical issues. We all deserve a home where we breathe clean air and drink clean water. The scientific community is standing against the repeal, and the evidence is clear and abundant regarding the findings. If the EPA moves forward with this plan, it will put the health of all Alaskans and Americans in jeopardy.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-2-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 14:58:18.252916

Over the last couple of decades, few if any American economists have played a more prominent role in the national debate over the economy or in actually crafting economic policy than Jared Bernstein. Bernstein served as chair of the national Council of Economic Advisers under President Biden and is currently a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a Distinguished Policy Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.
And recently Bernstein was kind enough to join NC Newsline for a conversation about the current state of the U.S. economy and, among many other things, how the ongoing rise in inflation combined with growth in unemployment signals the arrival of the dreaded phenomenon known as stagflation, and how President Trump’s chaotic policies – most notably the imposition of tariffs on imported goods and services – are fueling what could well be a very destructive and hard-to-reverse economic trend.

Snowpack decline in the Northeast stresses trees and can reduce their ability to sequester carbon, Templer said. (Photo by Emerson Conrad-Rooney/Templer Lab)New England residents know that snow is disappearing from our landscape, and scientists have proven that climate change is to blame. But the effects of snowpack decline go far beyond what’s visible, and researchers working in the forests of New Hampshire and the Northeast are learning more about just how far the phenomenon stretches across seasons and landscapes. Their findings reveal how much tracking snow can tell us about the health of our forests and our world, and what is still to learn.
The average amount of snow that accumulates on the ground throughout the winter season, or snowpack, is shrinking from year to year across the Northeast. While data has captured that effect (and linked it to human-caused climate change), many who live and recreate in the region have noticed it in their own lives — including the researchers who later took up the matter in their work.
“I grew up cross-country skiing with my family,” said Emerson Conrad-Rooney, a doctoral student at Boston University whose work focuses on the effects of climate change on northern forests. Conrad-Rooney, who grew up in western Massachusetts, said the places they had grown up skiing through the winter were, in recent years, open only a handful of days all season long. “That’s been kind of separate from this research I’m doing, but just something that me and my family have seen … We’re, I think, definitely feeling that change,” they said.
Eric Kelsey, a meteorologist and researcher at Plymouth State University, also grew up an enthusiastic winter recreator in Nashua. A love of snow and weather led Kelsey to learn more about the integral role of snowpack to the water cycle. But as he read more, Kelsey was struck by the relative lack of cohesive, long-term snowpack data, especially compared to other weather datasets tracking things like daily high and low temperatures and rainfall.
“We just don’t have a climatology of snowpack — that was surprising to me,” Kelsey said.
The problem, Kelsey said, was not necessarily a lack of data. For more than a century, people across the Northeast have logged information about snowfall, from dam operators attempting to predict how snowmelt would affect their rivers to farmers and ski slope proprietors.

Most tracked snow depth and snow water equivalent (the amount of water contained in that snow, a measure that fluctuates with snow density). Their observations, taken as a whole, are a rich collection of information about snowfall in New England, Kelsey said. But the records were also scattered and disparate, making it difficult for scientists to unlock the information they contained.
Now, Kelsey and Plymouth State graduate student David Zywiczynski are halfway through a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grant-funded effort to unify and clean that data, which includes measurements taken over yearslong periods from more than 400 sites. Then, they hope, scientists will be able to use it to make sense of long-term patterns in local snowpack, from general decline to years of snow drought — or abnormally low snowfall conditions.
Because snowpack plays an important role in replenishing streams, lakes, and aquifers when it melts each spring, a tool to identify snow drought with more certainty could help forecasters anticipate the dry conditions that will likely persist later in the year, Kelsey said. The “snow drought index” Kelsey and Zywiczynski are working on to facilitate that may be the first tool of its kind in the nation.
As historic data is put to work at Plymouth State, elsewhere in New Hampshire, scientists are tracking ongoing changes in forests as they unfold.
Just beneath Mount Washington in Pinkham Notch, Appalachian Mountain Club Senior Scientist Georgia Murray oversees the collection of daily snowpack depth and snow water equivalent measurements. Data collected in the notch and above at the Mount Washington Observatory stretches back to the 1930s, Murray said, constituting one of the longer sets of continuous snowpack observations available in the region.
Measurements from the two relatively close sites are often very different on the same day, highlighting how difficult it can be to assess snowpack, Murray said. Unlike rain, snow blows around once it falls, clearing off some areas completely and piling up in others. Having data from as many sites as possible is desirable for a more comprehensive understanding, Murray said, so she also works to encourage citizen scientists to measure and submit snowpack data across the region through a smartphone app.
“It’s complex with snowpack, because you have, you know, nooks and crannies across the mountain, and so you have so many ways that snow is distributed differently. Having citizen science data fill in the gaps is something we really value in the mountain ecosystem, where we can’t be everywhere,” Murray said.
Citizen science data also helps keep track of the downstream effects of snowpack decline, including its impact on plant life. Plants rely on natural cues to time their life cycles; when some cues, like the presence of snow, change while others, like day length, do not, they may be negatively impacted, Murray said.
“In climate change, there can be these mismatches of synchronicity,” she said.
Furthermore, as snow melts in spring, the water it releases carries nutrients through the soil, making them more available to the roots of hungry and thirsty young plants. But data shows that the timing of snow melt is changing, too, starting earlier and lasting for longer. Murray hopes citizen data will help shine a light on what that could mean for White Mountain plants, from delicate spring ephemeral wildflowers to alpine trees.
“The snowmelt timing has a strong impact in the spring, and can have a ripple effect over the growing season,” she said.
Understanding those and other ripple effects of snowpack decline is crucial to making informed predictions about what the future might bring for New England, researchers said.
Pamela Templer, chair of the Biology department at Boston University and a researcher who has studied northern forests for more than two decades, established a set of three research plots at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, in the White Mountains, about 10 years ago. The goal of the study, entitled “Climate Change Across Seasons Experiment,” or CCASE, was to assess how seasonal changes play off each other in yearly cycles.
Before that study, researchers had shown that in summer, temperate forests experienced some positive effects from growing seasons that were stretching longer, Templer said. Separate studies, including in Templer’s own work, had revealed the negative impacts on temperate forests from warming winters. But Templer wanted to assess those two phenomena together.
“We didn’t know at that point what the net effect of those two changes in climate were on the forest,” Templer said.

To do so, Templer and her team — including Conrad-Rooney and “a village” of other researchers — simulated the freeze-thaw cycle, which can occur in the forest floor when it is not protected by an insulating layer of snow, by removing snow in some plots and heating the ground before allowing it to re-freeze. Precise measurements of the trees within the plot, taken over the 10 years the study has run so far, tracked the forest’s growth and the amount of carbon it was storing away over that period.
The work is a demonstration of one of the many ways snowpack decline can add stress into an ecosystem, said Kelsey, who was not involved in the study.
To a tree, damage from repeated freezing and thawing “is, you know, like getting a cut on your finger,” Kelsey said. “It hurts, it will take some resources from your body to heal it, that could be doing other things… And as we know, if there’s too many stressors on a tree, it will die. So this is just adding another stressor to the trees. That’s not good.”
Ultimately, Templer, Conrad-Rooney, and researcher Andrew Reinmann concluded in a study published this July that the benefits to trees from longer growing seasons were outweighed by the damage those trees suffered from repeated freeze-thaw cycles in the winter. That finding, they said, reveals that previous models projecting forests’ role in helping sequester carbon may have overestimated their role in absorbing greenhouse gas.
“If we think that forests are actually storing more carbon than is actually happening, then that means that, maybe, more carbon would be going into our atmosphere than we realize,” Conrad-Rooney said.
This realization has implications for scientists’ ability to model ecosystem changes into the future. It could also inform land conservation decisions, Templer said.
“We need an accurate accounting,” she said. “If we’re going to use forests as nature-based solutions to climate change in terms of sequestering carbon, then we need to know how much they’re sequestering.”
Researchers expect that as they continue to examine historic and current snowpack data, more effects and ripples of snowpack decline will emerge.
From its role in keeping lakes cool through the summer to protecting the landscape from wildfire, snow impacts the water cycle all year long, Kelsey said. And – as is evident both in the origin of the field’s data and its implications – the study of snow brings together many interests, including those of industry, agriculture, tourism, homeowners with wells, and more.
“It touches our lives in so many ways,” Murray said. “… We hope that people see the science that we’re doing, so that they can understand what’s happening, and how it links to their lives and the outdoors.”

The Trump administration was ordered by a federal judge on Monday to cancel a stop-work order against Revolution Wind, Connecticut’s nearly completed wind farm off the state pier in New London.
The ruling came nearly one month after the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management suddenly halted all offshore work on the project, which was already 80% completed, in a letter citing unspecified national security concerns. 
The project’s developers, which include the Danish energy company Ørsted, sued to overturn the order in federal court in Washington, D.C. 
During a hearing in that case on Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said the government had provided no new information that could justify its stop-work order, which he called “the height of arbitrary and capacious action.”
In addition, Lamberth cited testimony from Ørsted officials who said the company was losing over $2 million each day the project was halted, and that critical deadlines were nearing to resume work in order to begin supplying electricity by the end of 2026.
“If Revolution Wind cannot meet its deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse,” Lamberth, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, said. “There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm,” he added.
Officials at BOEM and the Department of the Interior did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the judge’s decision Monday.
In a statement Monday, Revolution Wind spokeswoman Meaghan Wims said that work on the project will resume “as soon as possible.” 
“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the US Administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” of the underlying lawsuit, she said.

The vehicle owner is Comanche County school board president Kelly Herd, a member of the board since 2016. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Comanche County law enforcement officials Monday asked for the public’s help investigating an incident in which 10 bullets were fired into the unoccupied, parked vehicle of the local school board president.
President Kelly Herd, and other members of the school board in southwest Kansas, have been embroiled in controversy that led to the suspension of superintendent Ty Theurer pending an inquiry into allegations he sexually harassed and inappropriately touched a student.
The student’s family filed a sexual harassment complaint and police report in the spring, but Herd worked for months to downplay substance of the allegations and to preserve Theurer’s administrative position.
The school board voted Sept. 3 to suspend Theurer with pay after more than 100 community members packed a school board meeting to demand disciplinary action. Many in the audience loudly criticized the board’s handling of the students’ complaint. There was a law enforcement presence at that meeting, but outrage was confined to a series of outbursts by people in the crowd and by Herd.
At 8:30 p.m. Sunday night, the sheriff’s department said, a vehicle parked at a residence in the 500 block of East Cottonwood in Coldwater was struck by gunfire approximately 10 times. Herd has resided at a house in that block for decades.
Sheriff Jacob Bruckner confirmed the vehicle was owned by a USD 300 school board member. He said the Kansas Bureau of Investigation responded to help process the crime scene and assist with the investigation.
“The vehicle was unoccupied at the time and no injuries were reported,” Bruckner said. “The investigation is ongoing.”
In a social media post, the sheriff urged Coldwater residents to check home security systems for video of vehicles or people in the neighborhood around the time of the shooting.
Steve Prusa, a member of Comanche County’s school board, said he was notified of the incident at the board president’s home shortly after it occurred.
The reality of someone turning to firearms to make a point about leadership of a public school district was alarming, he said.
“It’s not just a vandalism,” Prusa said. “It’s definitely to a different level.”
He said members of the school board, who don’t receive a salary, had stepped forward to serve because they sought to be of benefit to the community and assume a role in the education of students. The Comanche County district enrolls about 300 students.
“I am devastated and heartbroken for our community. Violence cannot be an answer to anything,” Prusa said.
Comanche County school board member Dean Yoder said it was wrong to interject violence into debate about education.
“So glad her and her family are OK,” Yoder said. “There is never a need for violence. Ever.”

Franz served as Washington’s commissioner of public lands from January 2017 to January 2025. In 2023, she began to run for governor, then dropped out of that race and vied unsuccessfully last year for an open U.S. House seat in western Washington’s 6th Congressional District.
After then-president and CEO of American Forests, Jad Daley, announced in May that he would step down on Sept. 30 at the end of his term, the search team hired by American Forests reached out to Franz and encouraged her to apply for the position.  
American Forests is based in Washington, D.C. The group’s mission of driving forest conservation and restoration, climate change mitigation and community resilience matches the values that guided Franz’s public service, she said. 
“For me, it’s about carrying forward the fight for healthy forests and healthy communities, but with a bigger canvas and more tools to create lasting impact,” Franz said. 
Working at a nonprofit like American Forests, Franz said, allows her to focus on mobilizing government agencies at the local, state and federal level, along with corporate partners and communities nationwide to accelerate forest conservation and restoration. 
“Like Washington state, as a country, we are at a moment of inflection where we must decide if we are going to save our forests or let them disappear,” she said. 
American Forests cited Franz’s work as public lands commissioner, including the development of several state programs related to wildfire response and forest resiliency, as reasons why she was selected to lead the organization. 
“She’s a collaborator and a team builder, and there’s no one who works harder, smarter or with more passion in driving change and progress,” Daley said of Franz.
Franz was the recipient of the organization’s first Forest Resilience Champion Award in 2019 for work on the state’s 20-year Forest Health Strategic Plan, and partnered with American Forests as public land commissioner to launch the Washington Tree Equity Collaborative in 2023.
In July, a former Department of Natural Resources employee sued Franz and the agency, arguing that Franz mishandled abuse allegations that the employee made against the department’s former top lawyer. Franz has denied those allegations.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hilary-Franz-Headshot.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 13:57:07.122583

The rapid rise of this remarkable technology is reshaping our world in many important ways – some that provide grounds for great hope and others that give rise to profound concerns.
Not surprisingly, AI’s rapid rise is also spurring discussion of a raft of ethical and public policy issues – from questions of privacy and consumer protection to the need to regulate so-called deepfakes, to the very question of how humans assure that they retain control over the technology. Thankfully, some smart leaders have begun to pay close attention to the policy implications of AI, and here in North Carolina, one of those leaders is Mecklenburg County State Senator DeAndrea Salvador. And recently Sen. Salvador joined NC Newsline for a special two-part conversation in which we discussed some of these issues, and how for her, AI is a deeply personal matter.
In Part One of our extended conversation with State Senator Salvador of Mecklenburg County, we dove into a discussion of AI – artificial intelligence – the hopes and fears to which it’s giving rise and, in Senator Salvador’s case, how AI allowed an online talk she had given a few years’ back to be excerpted and manipulated for use in corporate advertising without her consent.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into some of the important policy implications of AI’s rapid rise, some of the legislation that she and others have introduced to help steer things in what they hope will be a healthy direction, and a new AI leadership council that Gov. Josh Stein has established (and on which Salvador serves) that will try to keep AI working for North Carolinians rather than the other way around. Issues discussed: artificial intelligence, generative AI, workplace productivity, deep fakes, technology guardrails.

When the data are narrowed to the 1,236 first-time applicants who attended one of the state’s 12 accredited law schools, the statewide passage rate increases to 82.8%
The University of Florida Levin College of Law had the highest passage rate of the 12 accredited law schools in the state (92.8%).  One-hundred-thirty-eight UF law school graduates sat for the bar exam July 29-30 in Tampa and 128 of them passed. 
Jacksonville University College of Law had the second highest passing rate with 11 of the 12 graduates passing the multi-part test, earning the school a 91.7% passing rate.
Florida International University College of Law, Florida State University College of Law, and Stetson University College of Law round out the top five schools with the highest passing rates, scoring 89.3%, 88.5%, and 87.3%, respectively.

Passing rates were lower for the 416 first-time applicants who attended what’s described on the Supreme Court’s list as “other accredited schools.” The passing rate for those students was 66.1%. 
Another 243 applicants who were already admitted to the practice of law but sitting for the Florida Bar exam for the first time; 176 of them passed the test. That’s a passing rate of 72.4%
The Florida Bar examination consists of multiple parts; Part A and Part B of the general bar examination and the multistate professional responsibility examination.
The exam is offered twice a year, once in February and once in July, although the scores generally are higher in July when the test is taken by applicants soon following graduation.
The July 2025 passing rate soars past the February overall passing rate of 64.9% and eclipses the July 2024 overall passing rate of 76%.

Tressel said he will focus the remainder of his term on giving his full attention to education and workforce issues in Ohio.
Tressel’s decision opens up a more straightforward path through the GOP primary for Vivek Ramaswamy, who clinched the Ohio party leadership’s nomination for governor in May.
As things stand, he’s on track to face Democrat Amy Acton in the general election next November.

Michelle Lujan Grisham appears to have pressured members of the state Water Quality Control Commission to consider a petition reversing a rule the commission passed unanimously in May that banned fossil fuel wastewater from being used outside oilfield work and testing.,"A produced water pond in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM. Aerial support provided by LightHawk.)The administration of New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appears to have pressured members of the state Water Quality Control Commission to consider a petition reversing a rule the commission passed unanimously in May that banned fossil fuel wastewater from being used outside oilfield work and testing. 
The commission’s August meeting marked the first time in years that all four department secretaries on the panel had shown up at the same time, raising eyebrows. Those secretaries then led the push to support a new petition that would overturn a rule whose development entailed more than a year of hearings and scientific debate.

This story was produced in partnership with Capital & Main.

In a statement to SourceNM, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she “encouraged relevant cabinet secretaries to bring their expertise” to the proceedings. In an interview with Capital & Main and New Mexico PBS, James Kenney, the Environment Department secretary and a Water Quality Control Commissioner, said, “The governor did not explicitly ask us to all show up.” And recent reporting by the Santa Fe New Mexican reveals emails between the Governor’s Office, Kenney and other commissioners where they discussed pushing rules allowing wider use of oilfield wastewater “over the finish line.” 
When reached by phone at a bluegrass festival in Winfield, Kansas, on Wednesday, Water Quality Control Commission Chair Bruce Thomson said he was unaware of the email exchanges with commissioners. 
Thompson said he had not received any emails from the governor’s office and offered no comment when asked if he had concerns about the commission’s process. 
Many who supported the original rule are livid with the apparent meddling, explicit or not. “They’re putting politics over scientifically based policy, and that’s illegal,” said Mariel Nanasi, executive director of the environmental group New Energy Economy. State statute requires commissioners to recuse themselves if their impartiality or fairness “may be reasonably questioned.”
In a statement, Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for Lujan Grisham’s office, said, “The administration’s position on water reuse has been public for months. Directing secretaries to attend required meetings rather than send staff does not violate any laws.”
“This is the oddest, most political rule making I’ve seen in 25 years,” said Tannis Fox, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center. For nearly three decades she has worked on water issues while working in or alongside state government, including a five-year stint in the late 1990s as the legal counsel for the Water Quality Control Commission. 
At the center of the debate lies oilfield wastewater — also known as produced water — which is toxic and possibly laced with chemicals that operators consider “trade secrets” and do not have to publicly identify. Projects like the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium have worked for years to perfect industrial-scale wastewater purification. 
The Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance, which represents oil companies, wastewater treatment firms and other, unnamed parties, petitioned the committee to rewrite its ruling. It claimed the science of wastewater treatment had dramatically improved in the past year and the May ruling should therefore be rewritten. Environmental groups, which vigorously supported the original rule, say the rule should stand for its built-in five-year lifespan. 
At the August meeting, the four secretaries — from the Office of the State Engineer, the Environment Department, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health — were joined by the director of the Game and Fish Department and the chair of the Soil and Water Conservation Commission. A representative from New Mexico Tech, another from the State Parks Division and four members at large rounded out the meeting.
Led by Kenney, all but three voted to reverse course and proceed with the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance petition to pursue using treated wastewater outside the oilfields. No future hearings on the matter are currently scheduled. 
Kenney said, “It’s not uncommon for the cabinet to band together around a governor priority.”

That priority is the governor’s 50-Year Water Action Plan, he said. Among many initiatives, it calls for the state to develop a legal path for broader use of oilfield wastewater by 2026. The Water Quality Control Commission’s May vote likely eliminated that possibility.
“I just wish the administration would come out … and be upfront and transparent about what’s going on,” Fox said.
Two things are likely going on. One: Lujan Grisham wants a new source of water for industrial uses in a state suffering through a historic drought. And two: The oil and gas industry has a growing problem with tightly regulated, toxic wastewater it can’t easily dispose of. 
For years, Lujan Grisham and the industry have wanted to see one problem solve the other, with the wastewater cleaned and approved for use outside oilfield applications, currently the only legal use in New Mexico. That was a goal of the governor’s Strategic Water Supply, part of the 50-Year Water Action Plan. The supply creates a new water source for new businesses as the state’s freshwater supplies dwindle from climate change. The Strategic Water Supply bill originally included oilfield wastewater, but the state Legislature stripped out that language, leaving brackish aquifers deep underground as the sole source for new water.
The Legislature balked in large part because oilfield wastewater is highly toxic, hard to clean and difficult to test. Debating the idea before the Water Quality Control Commission switched the forum from the legislative to the bureaucratic realm, where the number of people involved is smaller and nearly all of them have been appointed by the governor.
Kenney has been on the commission since 2019 but until recently sent a representative to the commission meetings in his stead. At his first meeting in July, he supported the petition to remake the wastewater rule, though five of his own Environment Department scientists had previously testified that treated oilfield wastewater could not be safely used elsewhere. When he attended the August meeting, his second, Kenney led the commission to a divided vote to proceed with the petition. 
Kenney said that water treatment science had changed so much even before the commission’s May vote that the petition deserved to be considered. The May rule, he said, was guided by “2022 or earlier science” and the process didn’t allow for subsequent research to be admitted as evidence. Hearings do have cutoff dates after which new information generally can’t be introduced, to give commissioners a fixed set of information to ponder. “We couldn’t introduce new testimony,” he said.
Fox disagreed. “Scientific materials were NOT limited to 2022 materials, and peer reviewed articles and other materials from 2023 and 2024 came into evidence,” she said in an email. “It was possible to introduce into evidence science up through May 2024,” she said in a subsequent phone call. Deliberations ran for a year beyond that.
Fox acknowledged the technology to turn toxic brine into demonstrably safe water is “inching along.” Even so, “There hasn’t been some sort of earth-shattering [scientific] article that says, ‘Hey! We got this one! We got a silver bullet here!’” 
Jennifer Bradfute, president of the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance, disagrees. She said her group has a collection of recent scientific papers showing successful treatment of oilfield wastewater. During the August hearing, she held up as evidence a list of scientific papers she said she found on Google Scholar. 
Fox later dismissed the list, saying, “Some are relevant, some are not relevant, but none are showing that discharge at scale is safe. It’s just a bunch of articles on produced water.”
Pei Xu, a professor in the department of civil engineering at New Mexico State University and a lead researcher at the Produced Water Research Consortium, is at the bleeding edge of several scientific studies currently testing the safety of different water treatment and testing procedures for oilfield wastewater. In a detailed interview, she described current, unfinished studies quantifying any effects of treated water on small animals and plants. She also shared a half-dozen recent papers indicating successful treatment of oilfield wastewater.
Xu said she is confident that wastewater can be treated to safe levels today. However, she said, “If everybody looks for the peer-reviewed publications, I think we still need some time, especially related to all these ongoing studies.” Peer review, the gold standard of scientific research, allows other scientists in the field to critique the work done. It’s a process that can take months after the research has finished. 
In the end, Xu said that it’s not her decision to use treated water outside a testing laboratory — that rests with the state. “I will work on science, and then how they will utilize the data, it’ll be up to the regulators,” she said.

During the August hearing, commissioners asked Kenney if Environment Department scientists could validate the results of any new studies for the commission.
Environment Department scientists had previously testified that research into wastewater purification technology had not advanced to a point that it was safe to use in large scale applications beyond the oilfield.
“I suspect most of the commissioners do not feel they are technically qualified to determine whether the results that are presented by these … new papers and studies, if they are in fact truthful,” said Thomson, chair of the committee. 
In fact, state law says, “The water quality control commission shall receive staff support from the department of environment.”
At the commission meeting, however, Zachary Ogaz, general counsel for the Environment Department, said the department had “no obligation” to make its scientists available. And Kenney hedged, saying that department turnover means scientists would “need to get up to speed” in order to testify before the commission. 
“While I think it’s important to have a regulator validate the science, I think it is the obligation of the parties to present testimony that can be verified and validated,” he said.
On Sept. 4, Mariel Nanasi of New Energy Economy filed a motion requesting that the Water Quality Control Commission require the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance to “disclose the scientific basis” relied on to develop its petition.
On Sept. 19, Bradfute’s group responded, asking the commission to deny that motion, calling it an “extra-regulatory” requirement that should be addressed in a hearing. Even so, the response included a statement from a scientist working at a Texas-based wastewater treatment company outlining the last three years of water treatment science, concluding, “The use of treated produced water can occur in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, provided treatment is robust, monitoring comprehensive, and regulatory safeguards enforced.” It went on to list 16 new and older papers on wastewater science.

Oilfield wastewater is a growing, expensive headache for oil and gas producers across the country, particularly in the Permian Basin — the nation’s most productive oilfield — which straddles Texas and New Mexico. Around five barrels of wastewater are produced for every barrel of oil in the Permian Basin, and the total has increased every year as the basin’s production has grown. 
The water is highly saline and loaded with naturally occurring minerals as well as chemicals added in the drilling process. All of that eventually comes back up the well, mixed with the oil and gas. Sometimes the water is contaminated with naturally occurring radioactive minerals, too. 
Neither the federal government nor New Mexico requires drillers to publicly list drilling chemicals considered “trade secrets,” so it’s not perfectly known what goes down and up a well. Colorado does require operators to disclose all chemicals used in fracking, but a recent study alleges that companies there don’t always do so. Chevron, one of the companies named in the study, is represented on the board of the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance. (Since the report came out, Chevron has complied with the Colorado law.)
The overarching issue is what to do with the produced water. A small percentage is lightly cleaned and reused to drill new wells — a process that uses millions of gallons per well. For years, companies have also injected the water back into the ground, but that triggers earthquakes and some spectacular leaks. New Mexico tallies how much wastewater is produced and how much is injected, but it doesn’t track how much is shipped to Texas for disposal. The problems continue there.

Recently, ConocoPhillips said it is producing less oil and more water than expected in a Texas field just south of the New Mexico state line because of wastewater contamination from nearby disposal wells. In a motion filed with the Texas Railroad Commission (the state’s main oil and gas regulatory body), ConocoPhillips opposed Pilot Water Solutions’ plan to drill an additional wastewater well in the area. The motion read, “Pilot is banking on increased regional need for disposal capacity resulting from wells producing waste in other Texas counties and New Mexico.” Last year, the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division cancelled 75 proposed wastewater wells along the same stretch of border due to increasingly frequent earthquakes. ConocoPhillips also has a board member at the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance. 
Bradfute, the alliance president, helped write New Mexico’s law on oil and gas wastewater that clarified who had oversight of the water and barred its use outside the oilfield. The law also created the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium to study how to clean and test produced water so it can eventually be used more broadly. Despite years of testing, however, the constantly shifting nature of what is in wastewater raises questions about the treated water’s safety, which is what led the Water Quality Control Commission to nix its broader use in May.
Bradfute formed the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance in September 2024, three weeks after final arguments were made in the commission’s original hearings. She said that timing is coincidental — the original impetus was to promote treating brackish and produced water in response to Gov. Lujan Grisham’s 50-Year Water Action Plan.
Bradfute said there are about 25 members of the alliance, but she wouldn’t name them. “Some of my members have been pretty severely attacked by different interest groups as a result of the rulemaking,” she said. “There’s been false Instagram and TikTok videos that certain groups are putting out there definitely attacking individuals by name,” she continued.
Stephen Aldridge, the mayor of tiny Jal, New Mexico, is an Alliance board member with a history of wrangling over water in his corner of the state. Joining was a quick decision for him.
“If there’s a conversation on water in New Mexico, we want a seat at the table,” he said.
Since becoming mayor eight years ago, Aldridge has tussled with a series of oil and water companies that wanted to tap the town’s aquifers for water to drill oil wells in the surrounding Permian Basin. 
“Yeah, they don’t like me very much,” he said. “But hell, I’ve got two friends I’m not looking for anymore.” Besides, he said, “I’m damn sure an advocate for this community. That’s my job.”
The work has secured the town water for the foreseeable future, but only just. Aldridge says that there isn’t any excess to promote new business growth. That’s why he has his eye on produced water. Truckloads of the stuff rumble through his town every day.
“I’m not without my concerns, but I’m also inquisitive enough to want to see some pilot [projects] up and running, and I would think that others would be too,” he said. In particular he worries about the toxic remains from the water treatment process. Aldridge knows there would be a lot of it: Where would it go?
He’s waited years, watching the water cleaning science improve. He thinks it will be safe, eventually. Meanwhile, “Let’s don’t hurt ourselves in the process of tripping over a dollar to pick up a dime,” he said.

(Photo courtesy of attorney general's office)Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas has found probable cause that a Clay County teacher displayed “gross immorality” in posting about Charlie Kirk’s death, he announced Monday as Attorney General James Uthmeier launched a tip line to report “violent extremism.”
The teacher, left nameless by Kamoutsas, could lose her teaching license after she posted to social media, “This may not be the obituary. [sic] We were all hoping to wake up to, but this is a close second for me,” News 4 Jax reported. Kamoutsas said the post included an article about Kirk’s assassination, which occurred at a college in Utah. 
In keeping with his promise two weeks ago to investigate teachers making “despicable comments” about Kirk’s death, Kamoutsas said he found probable cause on four Education Code violations. Either the teacher can forfeit her license, or she can be tried in front of department’s Education Practices Commission or the Department of Administrative Hearings.
The commissioner is seeking the revocation of the teacher’s license. 
Teachers among those answering to employers after Charlie Kirk social media posts

“As these posts continue to circulate, more and more students are exposed to the dangerous and false idea that violence is an acceptable response to differing beliefs, an idea that has no place and will have no place here in Florida schools,” Kamoutsas said. 
The four standards Kamoutsas alleges the teacher breached are gross immorality, failure to protect the health, safety and welfare of students, reduced effectiveness as an educator, and failing to distinguish her personal views from the school’s.
“Holding educators accountable for speech that celebrates violence in schools is not a violation of free speech, it is a necessary step to uphold the standards of the teaching profession and the safety of our schools,” Kamoutsas said. 
Last week, Florida Education Association President Andrew Spar told the Phoenix that the commissioner’s letter to superintendents vowing investigations sends a “chilling effect throughout the profession.”
“For the commissioner to say there’s no longer a second-chance mentality in education and that he’s going to personally investigate and essentially be the investigator, the prosecutor, and the judge and jury in all of these cases is quite concerning,” Spar said.

New portal for complaints
On a broader scope, Uthmeier’s office opened the “Combatting Violent Extremism Portal” “where people will be able to report anything they observe or hear that is a call for violence or a threat for violence against other individuals,” he said. 
“Let me be clear, we respect the First Amendment more than anybody. We’re not going to be the cancel culture that we’ve seen from so long from the Left. We’re not going to believe in silencing individuals. But there’s a big difference when it comes to a threat of violence, a call for violence. That is not protected by the First Amendment,” Uthmeier said. 
Since Kirk’s death, people nationwide have lost jobs for speaking about Kirk’s death in a manner their employer views as disfavored, such as late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.
Teachers are held to higher standards than many other professions, the state officials said.
“It’s never been more important for people to speak up, for us to have safe academic environments where people feel confident to engage in discussion, free from attack, free from violence,” Uthmeier said. 
The portal, not exclusive to education settings, allows people to submit screenshots, videos, or other evidence of threatened violence to Uthmeier’s office, anonymously if they want to.
“We must protect before people are shot, before explosives go off,” Uthmeier said. 
Warning against abusing the portal, Uthmeier said, “We’re going to take everything seriously and, if you abuse this, if you provide something in a dishonest fashion to law enforcement, we’ll hold you accountable as well.”
The campaign in-part mimics the Office of Parental Rights Uthmeier added to his office earlier this year to field complaints alleging violation of parental-rights laws. 
“The First Amendment does not protect speech that is likely and intended to provoke immediate acts of violence, or speech that expresses a serious intent to commit a specific act of violence, but it does protect robust free expression, which includes criticism of the past words and actions of prominent public figures,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida said in an online statement last week following the state’s announcement it would investigate teachers.
“Dissent, disagreement, and counterspeech that criticizes political views should not be confused with condoning or encouraging violence,” the ACLU said, and retaliation for such speech “feeds hostility and division.”
After Kirk was killed, the ACLU continued, “Most people likely encountered speech they found despicable no matter where they fall on the political spectrum — that is the nature of a democracy where free speech is protected.

The Ukrainian couple left behind their home and their careers to seek safety after Russia invaded in 2021.
On Sunday, they promoted peace by singing duets at a fundraiser for their fellow Ukrainian families in North Dakota and Minnesota.
“We want peace,” Somkin said. “We also want to say thank you to the Americans for supporting us.”
Somkin is living in North Dakota under the Uniting for Ukraine program, which allowed citizens of that country to enter the U.S. under humanitarian parole. 
The continuation of that opportunity, however, is uncertain.

So far, Ukrainians have been allowed to stay in the U.S. until their temporary status reaches its expiration date, according to Global Refuge, a nonprofit that oversees refugee and immigrant services. 
Previously, renewals to this temporary status were common. Changes by President Donald Trump’s administration, however, have slowed document processing, meaning many Ukrainians are at risk of losing their legal status and work authorization.
Somkin was a soloist with the Kyiv Symphony Orchestra and Choir when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2021. On Sunday, his music entertained hundreds of supporters who came to support and raise money for the Ukrainian community. The event was held on International Day of Peace in Moorhead’s Gooseberry Park.
“It’s a terrible situation,” said Michael Southam, co-founder of FM Volunteers for Ukraine, which hosted the event. “The war (in Ukraine) is still going on. It’s not safe for them to return home, but some haven’t worked in several months because their renewal requests haven’t been processed.”
Southam has sponsored seven Ukrainians since the U4U program began. As a sponsor, he helps immigrants find housing and employment. He never anticipated that those opportunities would be shut off.
“Most of us assumed the war wouldn’t last a full two years or, if it did, we’d be able to comfortably respond and figure out how to continue to help them,” Southam said.
North Dakota’s first Ukrainian arrivals came in 2023. Most have filed requests to renew their parolee status and work authorization, but few have received any response, Southam said. Some Ukrainians who came to the states under U4U have been unable to work since June.

An anonymous donor gave a $5,000 matching gift for the event. Overall, more than $10,000 was raised, Southam said.
There were vendors and tables with crafts. There was entertainment and laughter. Somkin led his Bismarck church choir in the singing of the Ukrainian anthem. 
“We’re so happy to be here,” he said. “We have so many in our community who need to be able to work.”
Yaroslav Riazanov of Fargo is one of those who wants to return to work. Over the past two years, he has worked construction and driven trucks. He dreams of opening his own business making furniture.
But for now, he is unable to work. He filed paperwork to extend his work authorization several months ago. He’s still waiting for a response.
“I hope I can get my papers,” he said. “My money has run out and nobody knows what will happen tomorrow.”
He then paused and gestured towards a group of friends. He said he is frustrated that he can’t work to cover his own bills.
“Everyone wants to stay here and help this country,” he said. “We also want to help our families in Ukraine. We just need a chance to do it.”

Susie Gross and her husband, Derrick Gross, attended Sunday’s event representing CATCH, an organization that promotes legal immigration as a way to bolster rural communities.
The U.S. promised safety and security to Ukrainians, she said. The country needs to honor those promises.
“I’m a person of my word,” she said. “I want my country to be, too.”
Legal immigrants are hard-working and committed to their communities, she said. In rural areas, they can fill needed services to keep open institutions like health care facilities and schools. 
For her, the issue is also personal. Gross’s son married a woman who came from Ukraine under the U4U program. Her daughter-in-law’s mother works in health care; a younger sister attends school in a rural area.
“We have seen how immigration strengthens our communities,” Gross said. “Unfortunately, it’s a disorienting and scary time. It’s good to show our support.”
Southam said some Ukrainian families have left North Dakota and more are planning to leave. The uncertainty is too difficult, he said. And yet, the next step is not clear either.
Riazanov said he avoids thinking about where he’d go if he can’t support himself here.
“I don’t know,” he said. “I want to stay here. That’s the problem.”

(Getty Images)For many Granite Staters who rely on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace to access health insurance, premium tax credits from the federal government represent the difference between coverage and catastrophe.
But that lifeline is about to fray.
In New Hampshire, nearly 50,000 residents benefit from premium tax credits that help them afford health coverage through the ACA Marketplace. That’s approximately 70.7% of all ACA Marketplace enrollees in the state. These are Granite Staters who don’t have access to traditional employer-sponsored insurance — like a parent who works part time while their child is in school, the waiter at your favorite restaurant, freelancers, your hair stylist, small-business owners, and older adults not yet eligible for Medicare. Premium tax credits cut average monthly premiums nearly in half — from $469 to $230 — making health insurance attainable for many.
Unless Congress acts swiftly to extend these tax credits, which are set to expire on Dec. 31, Granite Staters will face staggering premium hikes in 2026. According to new data released recently by New Futures, New Hampshire’s leading health policy organization, in conjunction with Families USA, a couple in their early 60s earning $90,000 could see their annual premiums jump by over $14,000. A single individual in their mid-40s making $31,300 would pay $1,344 more per year. Nationally, experts warn that up to one-third of Marketplace enrollees could lose coverage as a result of the expiring tax credits.
For one New Hampshire resident and her family, the enhanced premium tax credits have made health insurance affordable. She works part time while her partner works at a local bakery; neither have access to employer-provided health insurance. Thanks to the tax credits, their family pays $99 monthly for coverage. Without the tax credits, that cost would nearly triple to $291 according to a KFF calculator. This represents a significant jump, and one she says would be challenging for them to cover. “With two young kids, life is expensive, and the expiration of the premium tax credits will set us back at a time when we’re hoping to save up for a home,” she explains. For families like hers across New Hampshire, the stakes could not be higher.
This isn’t just a policy failure, it’s a looming affordability crisis.
New Hampshire is the second-oldest state in the country, and one of only 11 where adults now outnumber children. Midlife and older adults (ages 45 to 64) make up 48% of Marketplace enrollees in New Hampshire, and they are especially vulnerable to premium spikes. A 2024 Altarum survey of Granite Staters revealed the impact of rising health care costs in the state:

71% of respondents delayed or went without care due to cost in the year prior
53% worried about affording prescription drugs
41% struggled to pay medical bills

These numbers aren’t abstract — they represent neighbors, coworkers, and loved ones already rationing care.
Without federal action extending the enhanced premium tax credits, health care will become even further out of reach for many of our residents. More information about the premium tax credits is available at www.new-futures.org.
Health care should never be a luxury. It’s time to protect the progress we’ve made and ensure that every resident can access the care they need when they need it.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acataxcredits-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 12:58:59.408007

Hawkeye Community College announced in a news release it has received a three-year, $407,940 grant from Americorps for its Senior Companion Program, in which volunteers aged 55 years or older are matched with older adults in the area to provide aid and company.

The Waterloo college announced in late June program operations had to end due to its Americorps grant funding — making up $400,000 of the program’s $500,000 budget — being held for review by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.
“We are such an incredible part of this community that it hurts deeply to not be able to continue to offer a service that benefits some of our most vulnerable constituents,” said Hawkeye Community College Provost Lynn LaGrone in a previous interview.
Before its pause, the senior companion program involved 52 companions who worked with 81 local clients, according to the college. Now that the program is once again funded, 48 volunteers have or are planning to return, with four more ready to work once they’ve matched with clients, the release stated.
The community college has also rehired a full-time administrative assistant and a part-time van driver, the release stated, and will hire a program manager in the future.
The senior companion program is one of the oldest initiatives still in operation at Hawkeye Community College, LaGrone previously said in an interview, having connected volunteers and seniors since 1976. LaGrone said at the time she was “cautiously optimistic” about federal funding coming back after its review.

Matt Lawless, one of six “local celebrities” who performed in Dancing with the Burlington Stars, says it gave him a chance to “be in public in a different kind of way.”

This story by Briana Brady was first published by the Shelburne News on Sept. 14.
Town managers have a lot of skills when it comes to dealing with town budgets or supporting the selectboard — financial acuity, communication, fluency in local and state laws and, often, patience.
On Saturday, Sept. 13, Shelburne’s town manager, Matt Lawless, got up on stage at the Flynn Theater in Burlington to display a different kind of skill: a willingness to boogie.
Lawless was one of six “local celebrities” in Dancing with the Burlington Stars, an annual fundraiser for the Vermont Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired. The event pairs each local star with a professional, mostly instructors at local dance schools, to put together a routine and compete in front of a panel of judges.
This year, along with Lawless, the local celebrities included a local pediatrician, an elementary school principal and a TV meteorologist. Spoiler alert: Lawless didn’t end up winning —the title went to Dr. Becca Bell — but he did have a lot of fun.
“It’s nice to be in public in a different kind of way. There’s aspects of performance to being in public service, but you only ever see certain parts of people. It’s a nice reminder that people are complicated and have lots of different interests. I’m happy to show a different side of myself,” Lawless said.
Lawless, who has a background in theater, recalled one memorable community theater role in which he played Satan’s jester, a large cat, gamely hissing on stage and climbing up the walls.
He was paired at the Saturday event with Elizabeth Seyler, also known as Dr. Tango, a dance scholar and instructor who specializes in the Argentine tango. He said the two of them spent a lot of time just listening to music and talking about what kind of story they wanted to tell.
The piece Lawless and Seyler performed was equally theatrical, with Lawless playing a bumbling sous chef to Seyler’s exacting chef de cuisine. The two chased each other around the stage, at one point enacting a kind of swordfight using a rolling pin and a wooden spoon. Eventually, they made up, learning to dance together.
The performances from the rest of the celebrities were equally full of joy. It was easy to see why the fundraising has grown. This year, the Vermont Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired sold over 800 tickets, with the proceeds going to support its programs.
Lawless said it reminded him how much he loved that kind of creative expression. He plans on finding more ways to dance, maybe with a dance improv group or one of Vermont’s social swing clubs. He might even get back into community theater.
“It’s a really fun, creative way to express yourself and think differently, move differently, that I had been missing,” he said.

Young I State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/goldberg-drops-legal-effort-to-prevent-obriens-return-to-ccc/,A judge late Wednesday said Goldberg was not likely to succeed in her appeal and denied the treasurer's request to block O'Brien from returning to her job as CCC chair while the appeal played out.,"TREASURER DEBORAH GOLDBERG is dropping her appeal of Shannon O’Brien’s reinstatement as chairwoman of the Cannabis Control Commission, her office said, a decision that likely spells an end to the two-year legal and political saga.
An Appeals Court judge late Wednesday said Goldberg was not likely to succeed in her appeal and denied the treasurer’s request to block O’Brien from returning to her job as CCC chair while the appeal played out. With that stay denied, Goldberg said Thursday she informed the attorney general’s office that she does not want to press the appeal any further.
“My focus must remain on the people I serve as Treasurer. Our work includes building new schools, strengthening the pension fund for our retirees, and creating new economic opportunities in every community across the state. I also believe that continuing with an appeal will further harm the Cannabis Control Commission and impede their ability to focus on their critical priorities,” Goldberg said in a statement to the News Service. “I remain steadfast in my commitment to fairness, integrity and civil discourse. The most meaningful way for me to honor my values is by focusing on our priorities at the Treasurer’s office.”
When she initially sought to appeal O’Brien’s reinstatement, Goldberg said in a court filing that preventing O’Brien’s return to work was needed “in order to avoid serious disruption to the ongoing work of the Cannabis Control Commission.”
Joe Baerlein, a spokesman for O’Brien said she was “gratified” to hear that Goldberg was dropping her appeal “and that the independent CCC can operate without any further interference from the Treasurer.”
“Chair O’Brien looks forward to continuing her career of exemplary public service and ensuring that the CCC fulfils its statutory obligations so that the CCC can serve the public as originally intended,” he said.
Goldberg had argued that Superior Court Judge Robert Gordon “got it wrong” with his ruling this month that O’Brien was entitled to be reinstated as chair of the CCC with back pay as a result of having been unlawfully suspended and then fired by Goldberg. In her statement Thursday, the treasurer said that she has “profound issues” with the decision she is no longer appealing.
“The decision minimizes the seriousness of Shannon O’Brien’s behavior, and also sends a discouraging message to those who came forward with their concerns. The Judge failed to protect them. Every person deserves a workplace free from harassment, bullying, intimidation, and discrimination. This is not a far-fetched idea and is simply about treating people with respect and decency,” Goldberg said. “When I attempted to have discussions with Shannon O’Brien about her language and behavior, rather than working with me, she responded by hiring attorneys and subjecting us to two years of litigation.”
When she fired her last September, Goldberg charged that O’Brien had “committed gross misconduct and demonstrated she is unable to discharge the powers and duties of a CCC commissioner.” But Gordon determined the evidence that Goldberg relied on “does not remotely suffice” to support O’Brien’s firing.
At the end of his ruling that vacated Goldberg’s termination decision, Gordon emphasized that O’Brien is to be reinstated “effective immediately and without further delay,” putting the last three words in bold and underlined text.
O’Brien’s term as chair of the CCC was set to run through August 31, 2027. The next public meeting of the CCC, which has been led in recent months by Acting Chair Bruce Stebbins, is scheduled for Monday, September 29.
Goldberg’s decision to stop pressing the O’Brien matter in court comes days after she announced that she plans to seek a fourth four-year term next year.
The Mass. Republican Party ramped up its criticism of Goldberg in the wake of the court ruling that said the treasurer was wrong to have fired O’Brien, slamming her for using taxpayer money in the legal fight and for “insulating her politically-connected staffers.” The party, which did not have a candidate for treasurer in 2022, said at least one Republican will announce plans to run for the office by the end of this year.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OBrien-leaving-court-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 12:58:59.408007

(Photo courtesy of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library)The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in North Dakota may not open to the public until July 4, 2026, but the education and virtual learning events for the 26th president begin this week.
The library is hosting a virtual programming series featuring book talks, discussions of Roosevelt’s favorite recipes and a behind-the-scenes virtual tour of the library.
Matt Briney, chief communications and marketing officer, said the library plans to hold about two virtual events every month, continuing after the facility opens. In addition, the library will hold in-person events once it opens, including single-day and multi-day symposiums, he said.
“You can fully expect a complete schedule from us moving forward,” Briney said.
The first event starts at 7:30 p.m. EST Monday. It will feature David Gessner, a creative writing professor for the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and his book, “Leave It As It Is,” which retraces Roosevelt’s footsteps and conservation legacy.
Many of the virtual events will feature authors who published books on the president that explored a specific time during Roosevelt’s life, such as the 1912 election, his time exploring the Amazon or his time at his North Dakota ranches, according to the event website.

Susan Sarna, senior curator of collections for the library, said those authors provide unique and detailed aspects of Roosevelt’s life, and together give a greater view of the former president’s life as a whole.
With the virtual learning series and exhibits, Sarna said the library is accumulating a one-stop shop of information and artifacts on Roosevelt.
About half of the pieces that will be on display are from private collections and never before seen in a public setting, such as a diary Roosevelt kept after the deaths of his wife and mother occurred on the same day, Sarna said.
“At the library, we really try to start from scratch and go all the way through to after his death and how the world was affected by his death,” Sarna said. “No other site has the time, the square footage, to cover all of this and I think that’s one of the most exciting things is that you are going to get a full picture of this man.”
Construction of the library remains on track for its July 2026 grand opening, Briney said.

An annual report documents the state's failure to make adequate progress for foster kids. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas for the fourth straight year failed to meet legal requirements to improve the severe instability of the foster care system or provide mental health services to children who need them, according to an annual report from an independent evaluator.
The failings include an alarming spike in the number of kids who were stuck sleeping in offices, minimal progress in the high rate in which kids who enter the foster care system are moved from one location to another, and the one-third of foster kids who need but don’t receive mental health services.
The report by Judith Meltzer and the Center for the Study of Social Policy documented the broken promises the state made in January 2021 when it agreed to settle a lawsuit with Kansas Appleseed over severe instability within the foster care system. The state promised to achieve specific outcomes for foster children, such as lowering the rate of placement moves and meeting mental health needs of foster children. The settlement agreement calls for an annual progress report by an independent evaluator.
“The report should be a wake-up call for anyone who cares about the well-being of children in Kansas,” said Leecia Welch, deputy legal director at Children’s Rights, which is part of Kansas Appleseed’s legal team.
“Each of these data points reflects a child whose life is in limbo — not knowing where she will sleep that night, missing school, and disconnected from family and friends,” Welch added.
In the report, which examines performance from the 2024 calendar year, Meltzer praised the state’s commitment to improving outcomes. That includes new contracts for foster care providers KVC Kansas, Saint Francis Ministries, Cornerstones of Care, TFI Family Services and EmberHope that set caseload limits based on national accreditation standards.
“We, along with our partners, have worked diligently to meet eight of the obligations agreed to under the settlement agreement and I’m proud of what we have accomplished and how we are improving the experience for young people in Kansas foster care,” said Laura Howard, secretary of the Department for Children and Families. “But there’s more to do. We remain committed to maintaining these results and pressing forward to fulfill the remaining commitments.”
Most foster kids are in stable placements, the report found.
But the few who aren’t are subjected to extreme instability.
Children who entered the foster care system in 2024 were moved at a rate of 7.24 times per 1,000 days, a slight improvement from the 7.94 moves in 2023 but still much higher than the target of 4.4 that the state agreed to meet when it settled the lawsuit.
About 83% of children experienced one or fewer moves during the year, below the target of 90%.
The report highlighted an alarming increase in the failure to place kids, which refers to a child sleeping in an office, hotel or other unlicensed setting. In 2024, there were 100 children who spent 316 nights without a placement, compared with 57 children with a total of 83 nights the year before. In 2024, almost all of those kids were in the Wichita area.
The report found minimal progress in eliminating night-to-night placements, where a child is picked up in the morning, sometimes as early as 6 a.m., and spends all day in an office or unlicensed center before returning to a placement after 8 p.m. That happened 2,006 times for 824 children.
“Overall findings related to placement stability are consistent with previous reporting — case reviews found that most children in DCF custody are in a stable placement, but children without stable placements continue to experience a concerning number of nights without placement (FTPs) and night-to-night and short-term placements that do not meet the needs of children,” Meltzer wrote in the report. “For a number of children, this placement instability is extreme.”
Just 4% of foster kids account for 50% of the total moves, the report said.
The state showed significant improvement in providing timely mental health and trauma screenings for kids entering foster care, with 94% receiving the initial screen. In 2023, just 69% did.
However, just 66% of foster kids who have an identified mental health need are actually receiving services. That’s an improvement from 52% in 2023, but still below the performance of 70% in 2022, and well below the target of 90%.
The report cited placement instability as a factor in delaying mental health services to kids who need them.
Meltzer identified the new contracts with foster care providers as a reason to be optimistic about future progress. The new caseload requirements, which were only in effect for half of last year, are “very promising” and already leading to “positive results,” she wrote, based on conversations she had with contractors.
The report notes that the Legislature rejected DCF’s request earlier this year to fund more specialized case management teams.
Meltzer said the state should look at investing additional resources in the Wichita area ,where the placement instability is concentrated. That could include adding more behavioral health intervention teams, support for kinship caregivers, and more therapeutic family foster homes.
EmberHope took over the contract for the Wichita area in July 2024. Saint Francis formerly held the contract.
Teresa Woody, litigation director for Kansas Appleseed, said it was concerning that western Kansas, which is still served by Saint Francis, and the Wichita area “continue to have severe, if not worsening, placement problems.”
“It is especially concerning that many of the children in these regions who lack stable placements are children as young as 2 years old,” Woody said.

Vanessa E. Atterbeary (D-Howard) said she will not seek re-election to the House of Delegates and instead run for Howard County Executive. (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The chair of the House Ways and Means Committee said she will forgo a run for reelection — and a potential shot at speaker of the House — to make a bid for Howard County executive in 2026.
Del. Vanessa E. Atterbeary (D-Howard), in an interview Friday, said she came to the decision this summer after a tough budget session and a milestone birthday — she turned 50 in June. Atterbeary is expected to make a formal announcement at an Oct. 15 event.
“I really love being in Annapolis. I really enjoy making policy.” Atterbeary said. “But at the end of this past session, I just started to think about what I wanted my future to look like.”
Atterbeary joins Howard County Council person Deb Jung and Del. Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard) in a race to succeed County Executive Calvin Ball. The two-term Democrat is term limited and cannot run again. Both Atterbeary and Feldmark serve on the House Way and Means Committee. Feldmark has chaired the revenue subcommittee since 2023.
Atterbeary was named to lead the House Ways and Means Committee in 2022 by House Speaker Adrienne Jones. She was considered a potential candidate to become the next speaker should Jones, who turns 71 in November, decide not to seek an eighth full term in the House.
Jones filed for re-election in June.
“I’m sure the expectation from a lot of people and from myself, frankly, was to stay and try to be the next speaker, whenever Speaker Jones decided to retire,” Atterbeary said.  “A group of folks over well over a year ago approached me about running for county executive. I just put it out of my mind, because, as you know, we were dealing the past couple sessions with some very serious budget issues, and I was just primarily focused on that.”
But Atterbeary revisited the idea after the 2025 session and her 50th birthday in June.
“The more I thought about it, the more I just felt like my time there has come to an end,” she said. “Over the years, I have brought people together and worked really hard on what I felt passionate about. So I feel that there are issues here in the county that need to be worked on, and need to be worked on by a strong, proven leader who has the ability to bring people together.
“And when I looked at who was in the field, there wasn’t just anyone in the field that I felt could do that. And so I decided that this is where I want to focus my effort and my energy and put my name in the race,” Atterbeary said.

BURLINGTON — A Burlington police officer shot at a suspect on Sunday evening after a standoff with police on Riverside Avenue escalated throughout the day. Vermont State Police are currently investigating the shooting, according to a press release. 
While police said in the release that the suspect is currently in custody and receiving medical care for sustained injuries, they did not explicitly say that the man was injured by the officer. The officer who fired at the man remains unidentified and has been placed on paid administrative leave by the department. 
The Burlington Police Department responded to a disturbance at the man’s apartment building at 7:30 a.m. on Sunday, then announced in a later press release that there was an active incident on the road involving a person in crisis. 
By early afternoon, police had blocked off the street between Intervale Avenue and Bright Street. Police officers could be seen standing in the building’s parking lot, crouched over a police cruiser with their guns drawn and pointing toward the back of the building.

Kenna Dwinell, who lives in the apartment complex, heard the suspect “yelling and screaming and threatening the police all day,” she said. 
The confrontation started that morning when Dwinell said she woke up to police presence outside the building. She was asked to leave around 11:30 a.m. noting that since then the situation had clearly escalated, she said on Sunday afternoon. Dwinell was part of a small group of residents and community members who stood across the street and watched as police and first responders swarmed the site. 
Dwinell said she contacted police about the same man on Friday after he appeared to be in a mental health crisis and was destroying her outside Halloween decorations. Before that incident, the man seemed quiet, and she had never heard any complaints from other residents about him, she said. 
The road remained blocked off into the night on Sunday. Vermont State Police Major Crime Unit is investigating the incident, Vermont State Police said in their release.

Northern Counties Health Care's Medical Director has seen a lot of pain, and knows treating it requires more than a visit to the body shop. It requires a mind-body shop.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  People are not cars.","A message from Dr. Tim Tanner, Northern Counties Health Care’s Medical Director and family physician for more than 30 years:
In my career as a primary care physician, I have witnessed a lot of pain. This includes, for example, the sharp physical pain of a nasty strep throat infection, the crushing pain of a heart attack, the burning pain of nerve damage caused by diabetes, and the deep pain of metastatic cancer. It also includes the emotional pain from traumatic life events, the death of a loved one, and the self-blame for past actions or inactions. Even with over three decades of observation, I still cannot explain why we seem to pay more attention to physical pain than emotional pain.
There are various scales to rate the severity of physical pain. (I particularly like the 1-10 scale in which pain level 5 is “Bees?” and level 6 is “BEES!”.)

There is medical jargon used to describe the source of pain such as neuropathic, visceral, or inflammatory. There is not the same level of specificity or quantification when speaking of emotional pain, and maybe that is as it should be. The terms used for emotional pain such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are both broad and nuanced. Although there may not be much benefit in assigning a 1-10 scale to emotional pain, I think it deserves the same level of attention as physical pain. Physical pain and emotional pain can interfere with our daily functions and nightly sleep. Both can consume our attention, force joy from our lives and turn an ordinary day into another 24 hours of survival.
I have often heard, “I can take a lot of pain,” or “I have a high pain threshold.” These statements always are in reference to physical pain. I have never heard anyone say the same about emotional pain. I am sure individuals have different thresholds for tolerating emotional and physical pain. Things have to get bad enough before someone suffering with pain reaches out for help. I have been simultaneously impressed and distressed by how long some people live with their pain before seeking help. There are often several reasons: hope that things will get better with time, cost, fear of what might be discovered, embarrassment that they cannot fix things on their own.
All pain is treatable, although it may not be curable. I break down the treatment of any problem, including pain, into three categories, self-management, pharmacological (medications) and non-pharmacological. Choosing among these categories depends on what is known to be effective and safe, what is available and affordable, and what fits best with the person’s values and priorities. Sometimes treatment may involve self-care such as exercise. It may involve pills. It may involve “talk therapy” or peer support. It’s great when there are good options in all three categories. This is the case for treating emotional pain.
I am very fortunate to work in a setting where I can call on behavioral health colleagues to help manage a person’s pain, be it emotional, physical or both. Our team covers all three categories above. Their expertise adds to the relief of pain that can be relieved, and coping with the pain that remains. Behavioral health professionals work side by side with medical providers in our offices. They are an integral part of our primary care teams, assuring that we fulfill our goal of treating the whole, complicated, physical and emotional person. Maybe its self-flattery, but I like to think we are mind-body shops, not just body shops.

At Northern Counties Health Care, our award-winning team includes counselors, Peer Support Workers and psychiatric providers — working together with you and your Primary Care provider to create a plan that works for you.

Here are the candidates so far,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/22/field-grows-in-mississippis-2026-us-senate-race-here-are-the-candidates-so-far/,U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith is facing challengers in the Republican primary in 2026. Democrats and an independent are also running.,"Several new candidates have entered Mississippi’s 2026 U.S. Senate race in recent weeks. 
The general election is more than 13 months away, but the deadline to file paperwork to run for federal offices is Dec. 26, according to the secretary of state’s office. 
Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith is running for a second full term in office. She is favored to defend her seat from Democrats, who haven’t elected a U.S. senator in Mississippi since John Stennis in 1982. 
Facing a Senate map that many analysts say favors Republicans, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said he’s looking for ways to break the GOP’s ironclad grip on Mississippi in 2026. 
Democrats have long believed the U.S. Senate was designed to over-represent small states, leading to a structural advantage for Republicans. That and President Donald Trump’s return to power have sparked renewed discussion in Democratic politics about how the party can become competitive in Republican-led states. 
This could prompt the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senate Committee to spend millions on the race in the Magnolia State. At the end of June, Hyde-Smith’s campaign committee had just over $1.4 million in cash on hand. 
Hyde-Smith has also attracted two Republican primary challengers, neither of whom has held elected office. 
Party primaries are March 10, and the general election is Nov. 3, 2026. Here is an updated look at the field and the candidates’ backgrounds. 
Republican Primary
Cindy Hyde-Smith  — The Brookhaven native is the first woman elected to represent Mississippi in Congress. She served in the Mississippi Senate and as state agriculture commissioner before moving to the statewide post. In early 2018, then-Gov. Phil Bryant appointed her to the U.S. Senate to replace Republican Thad Cochran, who opted to retire. She won a special election later in 2018 to serve the remaining two years on the term Cochran started, and she won a full, six-year term in 2020. 
Hyde-Smith is “100% MAGA”, according to Trump, who has already endorsed her. She launched her reelection campaign in late August by highlighting her advocacy for Mississippi farmers, her fight to restrict abortion rights and her close ties to the White House
“I can send a text to President Trump, and he responds,” Hyde-Smith said at her campaign launch. 
In 2018 and 2020, Hyde-Smith defeated Democrat Mike Espy, an attorney and former congressman who served as U.S. secretary of agriculture during President Bill Clinton’s administration. 
Sarah Adlakha  — A physician from Ocean Springs, Adlakha said in her campaign announcement that she was running to “stand with President Trump to secure our border, stop reckless spending, and fight for Mississippi families.” Adlakha also told Mississippi Today she would work across the aisle to improve access to health care in Mississippi. 
“I feel like not enough is being done from our representatives. I think we need people who are more effective and ready to actually go in there and work and legislate,” Adlakha said. “It’s not so much that I disagree with (Hyde-Smith’s) policies. I just feel like she could be doing so much more in the Senate to help our state.” 
In one of her first public events last week, Adlakha called a press conference to urge Trump to send National Guard troops to Jackson, as he did in Washington and Memphis. Standing before a podium emblazoned with a “MAKE JACKSON SAFE AGAIN” sign, Adlakha said such a move would combat violent crime. 
Andrew Scott Smith  —  The Florence resident owns a pork rinds business and calls himself the “Pigskin Politician.” He announced his bid for the U.S. Senate just hours before Hyde-Smith’s campaign launch event. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson in 2024.
Smith said he was challenging Hyde-Smith because she has become disconnected from her constituents. Smith said he considers himself a monopoly-busting conservative in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt, and he hopes to address consolidation in the American economy through index funds. He also wants to focus on the “fiscal future” of the country by phasing out Social Security and federalizing the national debt.
Democratic Primary
Scott Colom  — A native of Columbus, Colom is the elected district attorney of the 16th Circuit Court District in north Mississippi. He is the first Black person elected as the top prosecutor for the district. Then-President Joe Biden in 2023 nominated Colom to a vacant federal judicial seat in northern Mississippi, but Hyde-Smith thwarted the nomination. 
In an interview with Mississippi Today, Colom said Hyde-Smith’s voting record shows she has prioritized “D.C. politics” instead of hard-working Mississippians, including her vote for Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that slashed social safety net programs and provided tax cuts for the wealthy. 
If elected, Colom said he would push for legislation that raises the nation’s minimum wage and exempts law enforcement officers and public school teachers from paying federal income taxes. 
Mississippi Today reached out to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senate Committee for comment on the race. 
Colom is “handpicked by Chuck Schumer and George Soros to push Democrats’ radical agenda on Mississippians,” said NRSC regional press secretary Samantha Cantrell.
The Democratic committee did not respond to a request for comment.  
Priscilla Williams-Till  — The civil rights activist and relative of Emmett Till said on her campaign website that she’s running to enact laws that “will address historical and ongoing inequalities, while representing marginalized communities that work towards an equitable society.”  
“Even the election of former President Barack Obama, immigration controversy, and economic situation, it has become nearly impossible to keep track of hate organizations and the shocking rise in brutal attacks directed against individuals because they are Black, Latino, Asian, Disabled, Gay, or Women,” said Williams-Till, who grew up in Jackson.
Independent 
Ty Pinkins  — The unsuccessful Democratic candidate for secretary of state in 2023 and U.S. senator in 2024 has declared he’s also running for the Senate again in 2026 as an independent. Pinkins will be on the general election ballot without going through a primary.
Pinkins, a lawyer who lives in Vicksburg, announced his departure from the Democratic Party in June and attributed a lack of support from the state Democratic Party as part of the reason for his poor performance in past elections. Pinkins wrote that certain party leaders were “gatekeepers” who attempted to block him from advancing in politics.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22105058/AP25247764817841.jpg,,,2025-09-22 12:00:28.808608

(Photo by Daria Nipot/Getty Images)A coalition of New Hampshire-based nonprofits working on solutions to the affordability crisis in child care announced Friday that it has hired Julie Asher to serve as its inaugural executive director.
Founded in 2021, the New Hampshire Early Childhood Funders Collaborative seeks to connect philanthropic organizations as part of a mission to improve accessibility. This year the organization is working on a study to determine the full cost of providing New Hampshire children early care and education, the collaborative said in a press release. The philanthropic organizations involved include the Couch Family Foundation, the Endowment for Health, Granite United Way, New Hampshire Children’s Health Foundation, and the Neil and Louise Tillotson Fund.
Prior to joining the collaborative, Asher was a partner at Boston-based New Profit, leading the group’s Early Childhood Support Organization Initiative. She’s also worked at Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child and Silver Lining Mentoring. She’s earned degrees at Cornell University and University of California, Berkeley.
The average cost to put an infant or a toddler in center-based child care was $16,040 and $14,870 per year, respectively, in New Hampshire in 2024, according to Child Care Aware of America, which surveys child care prices nationwide. That represents 11% of the median annual income ($150,029) for a married couple and 36% of the median income ($45,086) for a single parent in New Hampshire. Additionally, research released in February from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute suggests New Hampshire businesses lost between $36 million and $56 million in 2023 because of staffing disruptions from employees forced to quit or decrease hours to take care of children. The report also found New Hampshire families lost an estimated $114 million to $178 million in earnings because they couldn’t find suitable child care.
“We are so pleased to have Julie join the Collaborative,” Patti Baum, NH ECFC member and program director at the New Hampshire Children’s Health Foundation, said in a statement. “Her knowledge and expertise will enable the Collaborative to grow our effort to strengthen the early childhood system in New Hampshire.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earlycareletters-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 12:00:28.808608

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)When the South Dakota Legislature convenes for a special session Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre, lawmakers will again be asked to answer a question that’s swirled for decades: Is it time to close the oldest parts of the state penitentiary?
A “yes” would mean a green light for the most expensive capital project ever funded by the state’s taxpayers.
A “no” could drag debate on the future of the 144-year-old building known as “the Hill” into another legislative session this winter.
Either answer will ripple through a state correctional apparatus that’s been subject to increasing scrutiny for the past four years.
The stakes, the stage
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden needs two-thirds of lawmakers in each legislative chamber to approve his plan for a 1,500-bed, $650 million men’s prison in an industrial area in Sioux Falls. The state Constitution requires a two-thirds majority vote for spending bills. 
Rhoden expects to have enough funding to build the prison without taking on any debt, due to money lawmakers have put into an incarceration construction fund the past several years and interest earned on that money.
On Labor Day, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko told Rhoden she’d resign on Oct. 20. Rhoden said he supported her, but also said he understood that her decision could help the prison win the support of the lawmakers who wanted her gone.

Since then, the governor has released the prison’s layout, added answers to a prison-focused Frequently Asked Questions page and held phone calls with lawmakers to make his case. Last week, he pledged to create a rehabilitation task force if lawmakers say yes to the prison legislation, released a plan that says the prison will cost $154 million less than the one he couldn’t convince lawmakers to vote for in February, and released a letter from contractors guaranteeing a $650 million maximum price.
Ryan Brunner, an adviser to Rhoden, wrote a column addressing what he called “myths” about the project that delved into some of the same areas.
A Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Kadyn Wittman of Sioux Falls, wrote a column urging lawmakers to consider rehabilitation and new models for corrections.
Meanwhile, a cadre of state lawmakers called The Freedom Caucus pledged to oppose the prison, and at least one 2026 gubernatorial candidate — Republican Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden — has done the same. 
On Friday, the Freedom Caucus said Rhoden’s rehabilitation task force should do its work before lawmakers vote on a new prison.
Another lawmaker, former corrections secretary and Republican Rep. Tim Reisch of Howard, wrote a column backing Rhoden’s plan. Three weeks ago, he was one of 19 House members who said they no longer trusted Wasko to lead the charge for a new prison. 
Path to prison began with Noem, but discussion predates her
Rhoden’s Frequently Asked Questions page points to 2021 as the starting line for the current discussions. 
That’s the year former Gov. Kristi Noem terminated penitentiary leadership at the Department of Corrections for alleged nepotism and accusations of harassment. No one was charged criminally, but the move quickened discussions about staff shortages and operational inefficiencies at the penitentiary, which was built prior to South Dakota statehood in 1881.
Governor announces $17 million deal for Sioux Falls prison site, subject to legislative approval

Questions about the building’s age, design deficiencies and capacity predate the Noem administration, however. 
During his first stint in the governor’s office in the 1980s, Bill Janklow successfully pushed to turn the former University of South Dakota campus in Springfield into the medium security facility now known as Mike Durfee State Prison. That decision was driven in part by an order from a federal judge to deal with overcrowding at the penitentiary, but also by the lack of suitable space for lower-risk inmates.
The state added maximum and minimum security units to the Sioux Falls penitentiary’s footprint during Gov. George S. Mickelson’s time in office. Those buildings would remain in service if lawmakers opt to build a new facility. 
In 2013, then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard championed a criminal justice reform package designed, at least in part, to keep enough people out of prison and under community supervision to forestall a penitentiary replacement. 
The state’s prison population never hit the 4,500-inmate figure Daugaard warned it might without his reforms, but growth didn’t cease. By the time Noem took office, the average daily population had hit highs of 3,900 — about 200 more than the 2013 average.
After the 2021 staff shakeup, the state commissioned a facilities assessment from a firm called the DLR Group. It concluded that the penitentiary was outdated, overcrowded and needed replacing. It also called for an additional women’s prison and listed more than a dozen other facility-related needs.
Lawmakers voted to begin putting money into an incarceration construction fund in 2022, and the year after that agreed to build a medium-security women’s prison in Rapid City.
Men’s prison location sparks controversy
The new women’s prison saw little pushback. That project, with a price of $87 million, broke ground in Rapid City on Oct. 16, 2023, and is still under construction.
One of the first whiffs of trouble for the men’s prison came 10 days earlier. That’s the day the Department of Corrections announced it would transfer $8 million to the state’s Office of School and Public Lands to secure title to 320 acres of agricultural land in southern Lincoln County for what it hoped would be a 1,500-bed facility.

The land’s neighbors said they weren’t notified and had no input before the announcement. They’d soon form a nonprofit organization called Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion and sue the state in an attempt to force it to comply with local zoning rules. Its members held public meetings and testified against the project in Pierre, where lawmakers in 2024 continued putting money into the incarceration construction fund and approved spending for water and sewer infrastructure for a men’s prison.
The group of neighbors earned the backing of the lawmakers in their legislative district, including Sen. Kevin Jensen and Rep. Karla Lems, both Republicans from Canton. Lems voted against the 1,500-bed, $825 million prison on the Lincoln County site in February, contributing to a 35-35 tie that sunk the bill in the state House before it could reach the Senate. 
Jensen has said publicly that he plans to vote against the $650 million version on Tuesday.
Task force, consensus, remaining issues
Jensen’s the co-lead of a legislative summer study on recidivism, which aims to find ways to reduce the state’s inmate population by reworking prison operations and rehabilitation programs.
Lems has said that building a new prison without knowing if the state can reduce its need for beds might be “putting the cart before the horse.”
Lems, but not Jensen, served on Rhoden’s Project Prison Reset task force. That group, convened by Rhoden in the wake of the February prison vote failure, set the wheels in motion for the $650 million prison on the table this week. 
State lost $21 million on failed Lincoln County prison site, governor’s office says

The two Canton voices echo concerns raised by several other lawmakers. Among them are Wittman, the Democrat who penned an editorial about the need for a new approach to corrections.
When Rhoden announced his rehabilitation task force last Wednesday, Jensen called it overdue and poorly timed. 
Others question the need to vote this week on a prison they could revisit in three months, during the regular legislative session. Rep. Marty Overweg, R-New Holland, put himself in that camp. Last week, while saying he hadn’t made up his mind yet, he said most lawmakers are “pretty dug in” to their own positions in the run-up to the special session.
Those positions will be revealed Tuesday.
The special session begins when the Senate and House gavel in at 9 a.m. Central time. Rhoden is scheduled to deliver a speech to a joint session of both chambers at 9:30 a.m., after which debate is expected to begin. 



Timeline of prison construction planning
Following are some of the key developments in South Dakota’s recent prison construction efforts.
2021: The state Department of Corrections hires a consultant, the DLR Group, to study prison needs, resulting in a focus on the potential construction of a women’s prison to relieve overcrowding at the existing facility in Pierre, and a men’s prison to replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary, which dates to 1881.
March 28, 2022: Gov. Kristi Noem signs a bill into law that creates an incarceration construction fund. She also signs an annual state budget into law that mandates a transfer of $70 million to the fund.
March 20, 2023: Noem signs a bill into law that authorizes construction of a 288-bed women’s prison in Rapid City and appropriates $60 million for it from the incarceration construction fund.
March 27, 2023: Noem signs a bill into law that authorizes planning and site preparation to build a men’s prison, appropriates $52 million for those purposes, and moves $271 million into the incarceration construction fund for future construction costs.
Oct. 6, 2023: The Noem administration announces its selection of state-owned farmland in rural Lincoln County as the site for the men’s prison, angering neighboring landowners.
Oct. 16, 2023: The state conducts a ceremonial groundbreaking for the women’s prison in Rapid City.
Nov. 3, 2023: A group calling itself Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion (NOPE) files a lawsuit in opposition to the men’s prison site in Lincoln County, alleging the project should be subject to county zoning.
March 7, 2024: Noem signs a bill into law that appropriates $2.42 million of federal funds to install water and sewer infrastructure for the construction of the women’s prison in Rapid City, and appropriates $20.89 million more for construction.
March 18, 2024: Noem signs a bill into law that appropriates $10 million of federal funds to install water and sewer infrastructure for the proposed men’s prison and transfers $226 million into the incarceration construction fund for future construction costs.
Nov. 14, 2024: The Department of Corrections tells members of the legislative budget committee that the guaranteed maximum price to build the men’s prison is $825 million.
Feb. 24, 2025: Amid rising outcry from some lawmakers about the price and location of the proposed men’s prison, a bill to authorize its construction, to transfer $182 million to the incarceration construction fund, and to appropriate $763 million from the fund for construction fails on a 35-35 vote in the state House of Representatives.
Feb. 27, 2025: Gov. Larry Rhoden, who was elevated in January 2025 when Gov. Noem departed to serve in the Trump Cabinet, appoints a Project Prison Reset task force, led by Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, to restart a study of the need, potential locations and cost to build a men’s prison.

Larry Rhoden attends the Sept. 9, 2025, grand opening of High Plains Processing in Mitchell. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Larry Rhoden’s opponents should probably hope he doesn’t get his way Tuesday when he asks the Legislature to approve his $650 million prison construction plan.
If the legislation passes, it’ll be another big win for the Republican governor in only eight months on the job.
Whether you agree with Rhoden and his policies or not, he’s proven surprisingly effective at resolving disputes and achieving his goals, and at making himself look like a contender in next year’s election.
When Gov. Kristi Noem departed in January to join President Donald Trump’s Cabinet and Lt. Gov. Rhoden was elevated to governor, Rhoden was viewed as a seat-warmer. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson was expected to easily thwart him in the June 2026 primary.

That scenario would echo the history of 1993-1994, when Republican Gov. George Mickelson died in a plane crash and Lt. Gov. Walter Dale Miller took over, only to lose in the primary to the better-known Bill Janklow (who served four years as attorney general, 16 as governor and one in Congress).
Rhoden is perfectly cast as the new Miller, not only because of the situation both were thrust into and the subordinate role they were expected to play. Miller, who died in 2015, was also a former legislator like Rhoden, was from the same county as Rhoden, was a rancher like Rhoden, and wore a cowboy hat and boots like Rhoden.
Although Miller’s political career ended with his loss to Janklow, being the next Miller might not be so bad, thanks to a bit of trivia that’s been obscured by Janklow’s outsized place in state history: Miller only lost to Janklow by 8 points in 1994.
When South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy released their poll about the 2026 governor’s race in April, Johnson’s lead over Rhoden was 1 point. Since then, Johnson has continued adding to his intimidating pile of campaign cash, which stood at about $7 million as of the most recent filing deadlines for campaign finance reports. Rhoden hasn’t had to file a new report since becoming governor, and there are questions about his ability to gain traction with donors.
Yet Rhoden keeps getting things done.
After taking over in January and applying a reset (his word) to every mess (my word) his predecessor left behind, Rhoden has been wrestling political problems to the ground like rodeo steers. The biggest of those are the three P’s — a pipeline, property taxes and prison construction.
Special session could resolve or inflame years of debate about SD’s pre-statehood penitentiary

The controversial Summit Carbon Pipeline proposal was tearing the state Republican Party apart when Rhoden came into office. He signed a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines into law and put the issue to bed, at least for a while.
Rising homeowner property taxes bedeviled legislators for years before Rhoden became governor, but nobody had come up with a workable response. He needed less than two months to propose, shepherd through the legislative process and sign a bill designed to slow the increases.
Noem left behind a wreck of a prison construction plan, with a site under litigation and a revolt from legislators who didn’t like the price or the location in rural Lincoln County. Rhoden appointed his lieutenant governor, Tony Venhuizen, to lead a task force that came up with a new plan, a lower price and a different location in Sioux Falls for legislators to consider Tuesday.
Rhoden hasn’t declared himself a candidate to keep his job yet, but he has a campaign website and is traveling the state on an “Open for Opportunity” tour that’s really an extended, state-funded campaign trip.
Johnson has won nine statewide races including primaries and general elections, and he’s not likely to be outworked in a campaign. There are other announced Republican candidates — Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, who was at 4% in the April poll, and state House Speaker Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids, at 2% — who could make up ground or play the role of spoiler in the primary.
A Trump endorsement for any of them would probably be a clincher. Failing that, Rhoden’s best hope is completing a successful audition for the job.
Those are the stakes for Rhoden on Tuesday, when he could clean up another Noem mess and rack up another political and policy win, or suffer a setback of his own making.

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) at a campaign event for JD Vance in Shelby Twp. on Aug. 7, 2024. | Lucy ValeskiU.S. Rep. John James’ bid for governor in 2026, which has positioned itself as the frontrunner in the race, was knocked down a peg over the weekend after the campaign came in fourth among declared gubernatorial contenders in a Michigan Republican Party poll.
Members of the Michigan’s GOP, from leaders to delegates and activists, gathered this past weekend on Mackinac Island for a biannual conference that allows candidates for governor and other offices to make a splash. The affair typically includes speakers and seminars, this year featuring U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Trump acolyte Ric Grenell, who serves as president of the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.
The event also featured a gubernatorial forum with declared candidates and those on the cusp of potentially joining the race – of which James was absent, according to The Detroit News.
The Michigan Information & Research Service Inc., known as MIRS, reported that James, of Shelby Township, and his campaign were also missing from a cavalcade of candidates and their supporters greeting Republicans as they made their way to the island. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Making matters potentially worse was the outcome of the straw poll, organized by conservative news outlet The Midwesterner. The poll sampled nearly 500 registered attendees at the event.
Results of the poll shared on social media showed Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township on top of the GOP gubernatorial primary field with 29% of votes cast. Former Michigan Speaker of the House Tom Leonard came in second with 23.5%; former Attorney General Mike Cox with 18.5%; and James in fourth with just 14% of votes cast.
Pastor Ralph Rebandt, who recently announced his candidacy and made a play for governor in 2022, came in fifth place with 5% in the poll, while activist Karla Wagner came in sixth place with just under 5%.
Candidate Anthony Hudson garnered just 0.8%, while other names floated by attendees for the poll got a collective 4.4%.
James remained positive about his race and his standing as the largest name among primary contenders, Gongwer News Service reported, but a Washington Examiner piece published over the weekend spelled potential consternation over James’ candidacy and its potential to upend the GOP’s stronghold in Congress.
Rep. John James joins race for Michigan governor, says state lacks “strong, competent leadership.”

U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain of Bruce Township told the latter conservative outlet it was “100% not ideal” that James was leaving behind his Michigan 10th Congressional District seat in pursuit of the governor’s office. McClain said the situation makes it difficult for the GOP to hold its two-seat majority in 2026. McClain later doubled down by saying that James was “absolutely” jeopardizing Republican control of his seat by running for governor.
That said, McClain was upbeat about the candidates that could come forward soon to declare in that race. Robert Llgjuraj is the only Republican who has officially thrown his hat in the ring.
An open seat would cost more money to defend and would require the GOP to spend that money on a new face, whereas it would be easier if James remained in the race, McClain added.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC_0364-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 10:57:31.835883

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)The commission leading Maine’s commemoration of the country’s 250th anniversary has launched a new grant program to support local celebrations of the Pine Tree State’s role in that history. 
The Maine Semiquincentennial Commission, which is chaired by Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and coordinates educational and historical events in honor of the anniversary, announced the new program Monday. The grants will be funded by the Maine State Archives and the Maine State Cultural Affairs Council.
The commission will offer grants of up to $10,000 to communities, organizations and institutions to do community-centered research, events or other projects such as museum exhibitions that commemorate Maine’s past or anticipate its future. 
“Mainers are great storytellers, and I expect we will see some memorable and poignant projects result from this grant program,” said Commission Director Sarah Hansen.
“This is an opportunity for groups of all types and from across the state to share Maine’s stories and reflect on Maine’s unique and impactful role in shaping the history of our nation.”
The funding does not require any match or cost sharing; however, groups must submit an application by Oct. 31. Applicants will be notified by Dec. 15, if they have been selected to receive a grant. More details about the application can be found on the commission’s website.
These efforts are in anticipation for the 250th anniversary of signing the Declaration of Independence, which will fall on July 4, 2026.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s high court has confirmed an unprecedented decision by the state Board of Chiropractic Examiners to revoke a license issued to a Fairbanks chiropractor.
The Alaska Supreme Court published its decision Friday, overruling a lower court decision in the process. Writing for the court, which ruled unanimously, Justice Dario Borghesan said that “the troubling facts of this case gave the board a reasonable basis to impose the most severe sanction of complete license revocation.”
Aaron Shoemaker, who received an Alaska chiropractic physician license in 2017, began practicing in Fairbanks in 2018 and opened his own practice, called Advanced Chiropractic. 
In 2022, the state regulatory board revoked his license after accusations of a variety of misconduct including sexually touching a client during a massage, refusing to follow mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, and “being convicted of crimes demonstrating unfitness for practice.”
In June 2020, Shoemaker, then 36, was arrested by Alaska State Troopers after stealing a road compactor and posting images of the theft on his practice’s Facebook page. Court records say he was exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis, and after his arrest he was briefly committed to a psychiatric facility. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for the crime.
The Board of Chiropractic Examiners temporarily suspended Shoemaker’s license in September 2020, and after an administrative hearing, permanently revoked his license a year and a half later.
Shoemaker appealed that decision to Fairbanks Superior Court, which ruled in Shoemaker’s favor in September 2023. The board then appealed the case to the Alaska Supreme Court.
Borghesan, writing on behalf of the state’s highest court, said the board did not abuse its discretion by revoking Shoemaker’s license.
The justice wrote that there was a reasonable basis for the board to rule that Shoemaker’s misdemeanor conviction demonstrated his unfitness, and there was substantial evidence to conclude that Shoemaker “attempted sexual contact” with a patient, in violation of ethical standards.
Borghesan also wrote that there was substantial evidence that Shoemaker violated professional standards by failing to follow the state’s COVID mask mandate during the pandemic emergency.
In a footnote, Borghesan scolded Superior Court Judge Thomas Temple for relying on an opinion column submitted by Shoemaker and ruling that Shoemaker had a reasonable basis to ignore masking rules.
“The sole issue facing the superior court was whether there was substantial evidence to support the board’s finding that … Shoemaker did not wear a mask when treating patients. … it was the board’s role — not the court’s — to weigh and draw inferences from the evidence,” he wrote.

Chellie Pingree has received several reports that attorneys have not been permitted to accompany their clients to routine check-in visits at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Maine. 
In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday, Pingree requested confirmation of whether a policy exists prohibiting legal counsel from attending routine ICE appointments, and if it does, its legal justification. 
“Should this policy exist, it raises significant questions about transparency and the right to representation,” Pingree wrote. “I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.”
Pingree, a Democrat, also formally requested a tour of the ICE field office in Scarborough, writing that local town officials have been denied entry after they raised concerns. 
“Clear and consistent communication with community leaders, advocacy organizations, and local officials fosters greater transparency and ensures that enforcement operations are implemented fairly and humanely,” Pingree wrote. “Without these relationships, DHS risks deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.”
Pingree requested a written response to her letter within 30 days. She emphasized in her letter that providing casework and acting as an intermediary to executive agencies is one of the most fundamental services Congress provides to constituents. 
“Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation — as well as DHS’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law,” Pingree wrote.

Today, he studies environmental and agricultural reform throughout the world, and he sees a need for a cultural shift in the way humans think about their place in the world. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — University of Kansas professor and attorney John Head grinned wryly as he summarized the possibility of agricultural and environmental reforms.
“It’s not pretty from my perspective, but it is promising,” he said on the Kansas Reflector podcast.
Head’s background growing up on a farm in northeast Missouri underpins the way he approaches research on legal aspects of the international environmental crisis.
He also spent decades working in international business law. Before entering the academic world, Head worked on treaties, human rights and international economic affairs through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.


In the past 15 years, he turned to studying international environmental law.
“What I have seen is that although there have been increasing crop yields and more precision farming, more sophistication technologically and all of that, there’s also been a departure from a kind of natural systems approach to farming,” Head said.
That is where he sees the promise — research today that supports a return to natural systems approaches, which include reducing inputs and shifting from annual to perennial crops, he said.
The “not pretty” part of what is happening today, he said, is continuing environmental degradation.
“There is a soils (degradation) crisis. There are also other crises, environmental crises, that I think contemporary conventional agriculture contributes to, and those are the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis,” Head said. “All of those have trajectories that are — well, to say they’re troubling would be a gentle and deep understatement.”
Although researchers worldwide are looking at agricultural reform, the lack of desire to tackle environmental protections makes change difficult, partly because of economic considerations, Head said.
“But also political changes are not very amenable to the types of agricultural reform that I think are promising and possible,” he said.
Ultimately, people need to reconsider their place in nature and let go of beliefs that they are dominant over the natural world, Head said.
In an article recently published as part of a University of Missouri-Kansas City Law Review symposium, Head dove into the topic of global environmental crises.
“I explain in the following pages why I believe that in facing global environmental crises, our species should reconceptualize its place in nature,” he said in the article. “Specifically, we should reject, or at least radically modify, a cluster of closely-held beliefs and world-views, including the anthropocentric perspective that regards humans as outside of nature or in control of nature.”
Redefining how we, as humans, think of nature is necessary, he said.
“The main point there, and it’s not original, of course, with me … is to try to make a shift away from having humans consider themselves dominant in nature and somehow entitled to be dominant in nature, with very little attention to the needs of not only other species, but the whole systems, the natural systems that create the home, that create Earth as a living planet,” Head said.
Much has been written in international law about intergenerational equity, Head said, related to the concept common in many Indigenous cultures that one should plan or look forward for seven generations.
An example would be when Wes Jackson, co-founder of the Land Institute in Salina, and environmental activist Wendell Berry put forward the idea of creating a 50-year farm bill in an opinion article in 2009 in the New York Times.
“There is no way that under the political system or the political environment in which Wes and Wendell were writing or the political environment today that that sort of forward planning would be taken up and dealt with, but I think the forward planning is necessary nonetheless,” Head said.
Such a dramatic cultural shift is possible, although the likelihood of such change is a different topic, he said. He pointed to precedents of major cultural changes, often made in the face of great trauma or during emergencies.
“In climate literature, for instance, there’s an analogy often drawn to World War II and the mobilization of economic power, of personal sacrifice in the United States and other places, as well, which were invaded, such as Great Britain, in order to rise to the occasion,” he said.
After the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, an editorial in Le Monde, a French newspaper, said “we are all Americans today,” Head said.
That recognition of interconnectedness, however, does not seem likely with the current state of the world, he said.
“But the problem, it seems to me, and the reason that certainly in this country, in this year, the likelihood is small for having a cultural change be triggered and implemented, is that there’s not the recognition,” Head said. “And in fact, there is an anti-recognition, if that can be a word, because we see in the federal government, in many aspects, a sort of a closing down of information, removal of website information, dismantling of weather service personnel, and a change in the U.S. Department of Agriculture in terms of assistance for farmers.”
The refusal to recognize the crises that are occurring in the environment doesn’t mean the world shouldn’t be preparing, Head said. Systems can be planned and research continued on ways to introduce natural farming practices, and when the political winds shift, new approaches can be ready to go, he said.
“This is a globalized world,” he said. “There’s no denying that now. So if you have a global crisis — climate crisis, soils crisis, biodiversity crisis — it’s impossible, in my view, to deal with that other than in a global fashion, with international multilateral efforts.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/John-Head-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 09:57:46.850222

“As a civil rights advocate and the son of a small business owner, I know the barriers entrepreneurs face in the marketplace,” said Kreuzer in a press release. “Supporting workers and supporting industry are not mutually exclusive. I’ll fight to ensure workers’ financial needs are met while also providing resources to help businesses thrive.”
The district is currently held by State Sen. Mark Huizenga (R-Walker), who defeated former State Rep. David LaGrand – now the mayor of Grand Rapids – in a close 2022 election, receiving 405 more votes. Huizenga is seeking reelection.
The seat will likely serve as a battleground in 2026 as Senate Republicans look to take control of the chamber, where Democrats presently hold a slim 19-18 majority. 
Also in the race for the Democratic nomination is State Rep. Carol Glanville (D-Walker), who announced her candidacy last week.
Kreuzer outlined priorities including increasing affordable housing supply through sustainable development, investing in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and fostering collaborative, inclusive communities.

MASSACHUSETTS’S FRONTLINE HEALTH care workers – doctors, nurses, medical assistants, home health aides, hospital technicians – are watching their profession buckle under worsening pressure. Existing critical staff shortages are colliding with new uncertainties around immigration enforcement and hospital closures, complicating health workers’ efforts to provide care and seek it themselves. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talked with 1199SEIU Massachusetts Executive Vice President Cari Medina and Anestine Bentick, lead medical assistant at South Boston Community Health. The conversation is part of CommonWealth Beacon’s health care access month and its special “Critical Condition” coverage.  
The 1199SEIU represents over 85,000 frontline caregivers in Massachusetts hospitals, nursing homes, homecare, clinics, pharmacies, and areas of the healthcare industry. Many of them are women, people of color, and immigrants.  
The second Trump administration began with a flood of executive actions aimed at reducing the number of immigrants in the United States. Ongoing attempts to revoke Temporary Protected Status – which provides temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters, or other “extraordinary and temporary” conditions and lets the immigrants apply for temporary work permits — could worsen shortages in home health aides. 
The feeling in the centers is “horrible,” Bentick said. “I had a couple of our co-workers who are Haitian. They were asked to leave because of their status. We were one of the health centers that provided care for most of our Haitian patients, and they’re no longer here because of what is happening.” 
Ramped up immigration enforcement actions are also impacting people’s willingness to seek care.  
“No one wants to come in to keep their appointments, because they heard rumors that ICE was in the neighborhood, which they were,” she said. “That’s really frustrating because we have the most vulnerable patients here in the health center in our community. And it’s very sad that they’re not going to keep their appointment because they’re afraid.” 
Centers like Bentik’s are already trying to do more with less, she said, building out their staff with younger and temporary workers like co-op students while dealing with an increased patient load because of the Carney Hospital closure. 
Medina said closings and uncertainty around the Steward Health Care system bankruptcy were an immediate shock to a health care workforce already dealing with high rates of burnout and staff shortages.  
“The communities were devastated,” Medina said, with a “lack of care, no access, especially in rural Neshoba.”  
The impacts were twofold, Medina said. “Career-long” health care jobs vanished from the region, with the union hurrying to find its members positions in other hospitals.  
“But more importantly, it’s scary because patients have to seek care so far away,” Medina said. “Just even getting prescriptions filled or having a regular doctor’s appointment is a struggle.” 
On the episode, Medina and Bentick describe existing pressures on stretched workforces (1:00), bracing for Medicaid changes (18:28), and how immigration policy bleeds into the health care space (10:00).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 09:57:46.850222

California voters approved ballot measures in 2008 and 2010 to model less-partisan redistricting behavior for the rest of the country. Several other states followed, but most still stick to the process of having state lawmakers draw maps in a partisan fashion at the close of every decennial census.Enter Texas and Donald Trump. The president, fearing that the slim Republican majority in the House will disappear at the midterm elections next year, asked Texas GOP leaders to redraw their congressional maps this year to increase the odds more Republicans are elected. Texas delivered. So, Newsom and the supermajority of Democrats in the Legislature put together Prop. 50 to suspend the state’s independent redistricting commission until 2030 to try to neutralize what Texas did.Already $90 million in campaign spending has poured into this ballot measure. So far, two polls show Californians are gearing up to approve Prop 50, though many are still undecided.  Learn more from the guide here.

California is known for wonky policy fights that generate big bucks in campaign spending and lobbying. We’re not talking about labor battles or dialysis, though. Today’s edition is about the gambling wars. 
Earlier this month, lawmakers approved a bill backed by casino-operating Native American tribes that would hurt their competitors. Assembly Bill 831 would ban the sweepstakes prizes gaming companies offer to encourage their players to buy more coins in online games, reports CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
The gaming companies say what they offer is safe and isn’t gambling. These games are expected to generate $8 billion in revenue, a legislative analysis said.
The groups backing and fighting this bill spent $1.7 million on lobbying this year.Newsom’s deadline to veto or sign the bill is Oct. 12.

Newsom signed a slate of laws on Saturday to bolster the state’s position as leader of the Trump resistance, including a contentious bill to prohibit federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing masks, with some exceptions. The bill raises constitutional questions about states’ abilities to restrict federal operations, report CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich and Jeanne Kuang. 
Other new laws bar schools and hospitals from allowing federal immigration agents from entering unless those officers show a warrant. 
In other immigration-related news, Trump declared last Friday that he’s seeking to increase the price of an H-1B visa from a few hundred dollars to $100,000 for new applicants. These are visas for international workers with at least a bachelor’s degree. California, led by its tech sector, is the largest recipient of these workers.Views on the visa cross party lines. Some say the visas promote U.S. innovation by staffing hard-to-fill positions, including at universities. Others contend the visas permit companies to pursue relatively cheaper labor, limiting otherwise good-paying jobs to U.S. workers — a claim held by the Trump administration. 
Banks and tech companies remain confused about Trump’s visa plans.

California Voices
As election day nears, we have two different views on redistricting:

Former redistricting commissioner Trena Turner argues that the costs of not backing Prop. 50 outweigh any other costs.
Jeanne Raya was the chair of California’s first independent redistricting commission. She says Newsom’s attempt at redistricting is an overreach.

What will California look like in 25 years, when it celebrates 200 years of statehood, wonders D.J. Waldie, former Lakewood deputy city manager and essayist. Our troubles with housing and water will likely persist. Whatever it’ll be, “Californians need to accept the burdens of their history and shape their aspirations accordingly,” he writes.

State authorities are scrambling to grapple with widespread use of artificial intelligence.,"In summary
The court of appeals said 21 of 23 quotes in an opening brief were fake. State authorities are scrambling to grapple with widespread use of artificial intelligence.


A California attorney must pay a $10,0000 fine for filing a state court appeal full of fake quotations generated by the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT.
The fine appears to be the largest issued over AI fabrications by a California court and came with a blistering opinion stating that 21 of 23 quotes from cases cited in the attorney’s opening brief were made up. It also noted that numerous out-of-state and federal courts have confronted attorneys for citing fake legal authority.
“We therefore publish this opinion as a warning,” it continued. “Simply stated, no brief, pleading, motion, or any other paper filed in any court should contain any citations— whether provided by generative AI or any other source—that the attorney responsible for submitting the pleading has not personally read and verified.”
The opinion, issued 10 days ago in California’s 2nd District Court of Appeal, is a clear example of why the state’s legal authorities are scrambling to regulate the use of AI in the judiciary. The state’s Judicial Council two weeks ago issued guidelines requiring judges and court staff to either ban generative AI or adopt a generative AI use policy by Dec. 15. Meanwhile, the California Bar Association is considering whether to strengthen its code of conduct to account for various forms of AI following a request by the California Supreme Court last month.
The Los Angeles-area attorney fined last week, Amir Mostafavi, told the court that he did not read text generated by the AI model before submitting the appeal in July 2023, months after OpenAI marketed ChatGPT as capable of passing the bar exam. A three-judge panel fined him for filing a frivolous appeal, violating court rules, citing fake cases, and wasting the court’s time and the taxpayers money, according to the opinion.
Mostafavi told CalMatters he wrote the appeal, and then used ChatGPT to try and improve it. He said that he didn’t know it would add case citations or make things up. 
He thinks it is unrealistic to expect lawyers to stop using AI. It’s become an important tool just as online databases largely replaced law libraries, and until AI systems stop hallucinating fake information, he suggests lawyers who use AI to proceed with caution.
“In the meantime we’re going to have some victims, we’re going to have some damages, we’re going to have some wreckages,” he said. “I hope this example will help others not fall into the hole. I’m paying the price.”
The fine issued to Mostafavi is the most costly penalty issued to an attorney by a California state court and one of the highest fines ever issued over attorney use of  AI, according to Damien Charlotin, who teaches a class on AI and the law at a business school in Paris. He tracks instances of attorneys citing fake cases primarily in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
In a widely-publicized case in May, a U.S. district court judge in California ordered two law firms to pay $31,100 in fees to defense counsel and the court for costs associated with using “bogus AI-generated research.” In that ruling, the judge described feeling misled, said they almost cited fake material in a judicial order, and said “Strong deterrence is needed to make sure that attorneys don’t succumb to this easy shortcut.”
“We’re going to have some wreckages.”Amir Mostafavi, lawyer fined $10,000 after submitting opening brief filled with quotes fabricated by ChatGPT
Charlotin thinks courts and the public should expect to see an exponential rise in these cases in the future. When he started tracking court filings involving AI and fake cases earlier this year, he encountered a few cases a month. Now he sees a few cases a day. Large language models confidently state falsehoods as facts, particularly when there are no supporting facts.
“The harder your legal argument is to make, the more the model will tend to hallucinate, because they will try to please you,” he said. “That’s where the confirmation bias kicks in.”
A May 2024 analysis by Stanford University’s RegLab found that although three out of four lawyers plan to use generative AI in their practice, some forms of AI generate hallucinations in one out of three queries. Detecting fake material cited in legal filings could get harder as models grow in size.
Another tracker of cases where lawyers cite nonexistent legal authority due to use of AI identifies 52 such cases in California and more than 600 nationwide. That amount is expected to increase in the near future because AI innovation is outpacing the education of attorneys, said Nicholas Sanctis, a law student at Capital University Law School in Ohio.
Jenny Wondracek, who leads the tracker project, said she expects this trend to get worse because she still regularly encounters lawyers who don’t know that AI makes things up or believe that legal tech tools can eliminate all fake or false material generated by language models. 
“I think we’d see a reduction if (lawyers) just understood the basics of the technology,” she said.
Like Charlotin, she suspects there are more instances of made up cases generated by AI in state court filings than in federal courts, but a lack of standard filing methods makes it difficult to verify that. She said she encounters fake cases most often among overburdened attorneys or people who choose to represent themselves in family court.
She suspects the number of arguments filed by attorneys that use AI and cite fake cases will continue to go up, but added that not just attorneys engage in the practice. In recent weeks, she’s documented three instances of judges citing fake legal authority in their decisions.
She’s documented three judges citing fake legal authority in their decisions.
As California considers how to treat generative AI and fake case citations, Wondracek said they can consider approaches taken by other states, such as temporary suspensions, requiring attorneys who get caught to take courses to better understand how to ethically use AI, or requiring them to teach law students how they can avoid making the same mistake.
Mark McKenna, codirector of the UCLA Institute of Technology, Law & Policy praised fines like the one against Mostafavi as punishing lawyers for “an abdication of your responsibility as a party representing someone.” He thinks the problem “will get worse before it gets better,” because there’s been a rush among law schools and private firms to adopt AI without thinking through the appropriate way to use them.
UCLA School of Law professor Andrew Selbst agrees, pointing out that clerks that work for judges are recent law school graduates, and students are getting bombarded with the message that they must use AI or get left behind. Educators and other professionals report feeling similar pressures.
“This is getting shoved down all our throats,” he said. “It’s being pushed in firms and schools and a lot of places and we have not yet grappled with the consequences of that.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/10092023_CARE-Court_AH_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

As the U.S. Department of Education cuts back on grants to colleges and universities that serve Latino, Asian, Black and Native American students, California will lose millions — including money that will soon get sent to other institutions in swing states and states that voted for Trump in 2024.


In a few weeks, over 100 colleges and universities across California will lose access to essential funding for tutoring, academic counseling and other support services aimed at helping Black, Latino, Asian and Native American students succeed in college. 
The change comes after the U.S. Department of Education said earlier this month that it was ending a grant program that supports “minority-serving institutions,” claiming that it illegally favors certain racial or ethnic groups. 
Every state will lose money, but the Education Department’s decision hits California hardest. The state receives over a quarter of all of these diversity grants, since it has a high percentage of minority students, especially Latinos, and it has more college campuses than any other state.  
The state’s community college system could lose $20 million next year as a result of the funding cuts, said Chris Ferguson, who supports finance and strategic relations at the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office. The Cal State University and the University of California systems, which also receive this money, did not respond to questions about the amount of funding at risk.
Laney College, located just a few blocks from Oakland’s Chinatown and Little Saignon, has used these federal grants for the past 15 years to run the Asian Pacific American Student Success center on campus, helping students improve their English, build community and find work. 
At the end of the month, David Lee, its longtime director, will lose his job. “It’s like a gut punch,” he said, standing in his basement office, which doubles as the Asian student center.  All around him are signs of his legacy — posters on the wall from various campus events, photos of students and staff who treat the center as a second home. 
After CalMatters reached out to the college about the future of the student center, Laney College’s Vice President of Student Services Lily Espinoza sent an email to faculty, saying that the space will continue to be available to students after Lee leaves, although with fewer staff to support it.
Of California’s 116 community colleges, 22 California State University campuses, and 10 UC campuses, about two-thirds receive these diversity grants. Colleges that receive these grants get to decide how they use the money to support students. The grants max out at about $600,000 per school per year. 
Laney College gets much less than that, though. Lee said the school’s federal grant, about $300,000 a year, supports his salary, the salary of up to three part-time counselors and various expenses for events. The state also provides some money, and the college grants access to the basement office and community space for free.

The center is next to the boiler, which emits a loud humming noise for hours each day. A slanted pole runs through the middle of it, hiding wires and breaking up the space, which can only accommodate a few students at a time. 
Still, Lee is proud of the program and the impact it has had. “There’s a lot of history here,” he said. “We’re the only center serving Asian students in Peralta.” Last year, roughly 5,500 Asian students attended one of the four schools in the Peralta Community College District, which includes Laney College, according to state data.
In his budget for next year, which was released in May, President Trump proposed expanding  this federal grant program, known as “minority-serving institutions” grants, but he didn’t say why.  Both Republicans and Democrats have long supported the program, especially those who represent states with large Latino populations such as California, Texas and Florida.
But Trump’s support for the program didn’t last long. In June, the attorney general for Tennessee and a legal advocacy group, Students for Fair Admissions, sued the U.S. Department of Education, claiming that the grant program was discriminatory. In July, the Department of Justice, which is representing the Education Department in the case, told the judge it would not defend against the lawsuit, saying grants to certain minority-serving institutions violate the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on discrimination.  
The Education Department reiterated that reasoning with its decision last week to stop funding minority-serving institutions.  
But some minority-serving institutions, namely historically Black colleges and tribal colleges, are exempt from the department’s decision. McMahon said last week that she’ll use the money that’s earmarked for minority-serving institutions, especially Hispanic-serving institutions, and redirect it toward those exempt schools instead. 
The decision effectively pulls money away from California, which has a high concentration of Hispanic-serving institutions, and moves it to the exempt schools, which are generally located in swing states or states that voted for Trump in 2024. While California has many minority-serving institutions, and even one historically Black graduate school, none are recognized as historically Black colleges or official tribal colleges.
The first Mongolian student club
To be considered a historically Black college, the undergraduate institution must have been established prior to 1964 and have a track record of serving Black students, which is less applicable to a newer state like California. Becoming a registered tribal college is also difficult, even for schools that might otherwise meet the criteria.
As a result, most other minority-serving schools, including many schools with a high percentage of Black or Native American students, apply for a more general federal grant that only asks the institution to prove that it has less money per-student than the average school in the U.S. and that it serves a diverse population. 
Laney College easily qualifies. Its enrollment is almost equally divided among Latino, Asian, Black and white students. The school is struggling financially under the state’s new community college funding formula, potentially requiring it to merge with another local college in the coming years. Its hard-scrabble reputation was depicted in the 2020 Netflix documentary Last Chance U, which profiled Laney College football players and the issues they faced in addition to their sport — including hunger and caring for their kids. 
Laney College uses all of its minority-serving institution grant funding for the Asian Pacific American Student Success center. Colleges are typically only eligible for one of these grants, even when it may have numerous communities that need support. Though the center is focused on Asian students, anyone is technically welcome to the services it provides.
The center is what kept Narmandakh Suurinburneebaatar in school. After moving from Mongolia to Oakland in 2008, she spent years knowing just a few words of English. When she enrolled in an English-language learning course at Laney College in 2013, she wasn’t aware of the Asian student center. She was nervous at the time and struggled to talk with other students and teachers, she said. She dropped out before the end of the semester. She also enrolled in 2016 but dropped out again after the first semester.

In 2022, Laney College offered free classes in light of the decline in student enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suurinburneebaatar’s son had also started moving through the Oakland school system, and she wanted to communicate with his teachers. She re-enrolled again, but this time, a representative from the Asian student center came to her English class, offering interpretation services for Mongolian speakers. It changed her entire trajectory. 
The center offered support, she said repeatedly: support in school, in finding a job, and in taking care of her son. 
In the fall of 2023, soon after discovering the Asian student center, she founded a Mongolian students club with a goal of strengthening the community, including one event that brought over 100 Mongolians to campus. Now Mongolian students from other colleges come to Laney because of its support services, and Suurinburneebaatar works part time at the Asian student center, tutoring others.
Proven success
The Asian center has never been financially secure, even before the Trump administration’s support for minority-serving institutions began to wane. The federal grant is awarded on a five-year cycle and Laney College’s final year was scheduled to end this month.  
Though the college applied again for another five-year grant, and has received the grant for the past 15 years, successfully navigating three different grant cycles, it’s a competitive process and the money is never guaranteed. To receive the money repeatedly, schools need to prove their programs are successful. 
In 2019, Lee co-published a study that looked at how counseling for English-language learners affected their performance. The study found that students who received counseling support were more likely to “return and re-enroll” than those who didn’t, though the study also found that academic performance was roughly the same for both groups.

At Southwestern College, a community college and a federally designated Hispanic-serving institution near San Diego, students were invited to join what’s known as a “learning community,” where they had access to specialized counseling and content tailored for Latinos. An evaluation conducted by the school found that students who participated in the grant-funded learning community were far more likely to stay in school, to graduate and to transfer to a four-year institution, said President Mark Sanchez.  
Because minority-serving institutions have wide discretion as to how they use federal money, evaluating the efficacy of the entire program — including hundreds of institutions and thousands of programs — is tough, said Marcela Cuellar, a professor at UC Davis. Some programs are a mixed bag in terms of results. Nonetheless, Cuellar pointed to a few studies  that show the grants’ broad-reaching impact on increasing students’ retention, reducing their debt, and improving graduation rates. She said the new cuts are “heartbreaking.”
Officials at both the community college system and the University of California system agreed with Cuellar, saying the cuts were concerning or troubling, according to their respective spokespeople. A spokesperson for the Cal State University system said it was too early to comment on the decision. 
Using state funds, which currently represent about a quarter of the center’s annual budget, Espinoza said in her email to faculty that Laney College will replace Lee’s full-time position with a part-time faculty role next year. She also said the college will offer each student worker another campus job.
Lee has already offered Suurinburneebaatar a different campus job, but she said no. She’s taking five classes this semester in pursuit of a goal — to graduate this spring with an associate degree in business administration.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_Laney-College_MO_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

After winning a costly legislative fight last year against rival card rooms, California’s tribes got lawmakers to ban a type of online sweepstakes.


For the second straight year, casino-owning tribes persuaded lawmakers to pass legislation that directly attacks the tribes’ business competitors.
Earlier this month, the California Legislature approved Assembly Bill 831, which bans companies from offering certain types of online sweepstakes that the tribes see as a threat to their exclusive rights to gambling in California.
In an example of how much political clout the tribes have — thanks in part to the millions of dollars they have donated to legislators’ reelection campaigns — the measure easily passed both legislative chambers without any of California’s 120 lawmakers voting against it. 
In total, the groups for and against the bill have spent at least $1.7 million on lobbying the Legislature so far this year, according to filings with the California secretary of state.
Gov. Gavin Newsom hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign Anaheim Democratic Assemblymember Avelino Valencia’s bill. It follows a bill Newsom signed into law last year that allowed tribes to sue their rivals, privately owned gambling halls called card rooms, to try to stop them from offering table games such as blackjack. 
The tribes immediately sued card rooms after they won one of the most expensive political fights of the last two-year legislative session. The feuding gambling factions each spent millions on lobbying and on lawmakers’ campaigns. 
The tribes’ case against card rooms is pending.
How the sweepstakes games work
This year’s measure attacks companies offering a style of gaming that’s exclusively online — and already offered in California. 
Players typically download an app to play a game of chance such as slots or cards. 
Each day, they are given a limited number of free virtual gold coins to play. When the players run out of free coins, they can purchase more from the company to keep playing.
Even with a virtual coin purchase, there’s no cash payout for winning one of the games of chance.
But to lure in customers — and keep the ones they have playing — the companies also give out tokens called “sweepstakes coins” that can be used to participate in sweepstakes that are separate from the card or slot games. 
Sweepstakes coins are provided to players as a “bonus” with the purchase of gold coins, through promotions or as complimentary rewards. Those coins are potentially redeemable for real-world prizes or cash, unlike the game-play coins, according to the bill’s analysis. 
At least one of the gaming companies has offered a $1 million sweepstakes payout.
The companies argue that because the game-play coins have no cash value and sweepstake coins are not available for direct purchase, their business model isn’t gambling and their sweepstakes aren’t illegal lotteries since there’s no monetary risk for a player.
The virtual sweepstakes games are exploding in popularity. The so-called “sweepstakes casino” companies raised an estimated $3.1 billion in 2022, and was projected to surpass $8 billion by the end of last year, according to the bill analysis.

The tribes told lawmakers the business model is a dangerous form of unregulated gambling that needs to be banned in California. 
They argue the virtual companies offering the “dual-currency” games are cutting into the exclusive rights California voters in 1998 and 2000 gave tribes to offer gambling at their casinos, which have provided an economic lifeline to disenfranchised Native American communities. 
“Unregulated online sweepstakes threaten this voter-approved system by imitating casino gaming without oversight, accountability or community investment,” Isaiah Vivanco, chairman of the Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians, told a Senate committee this summer. “These illegal platforms erase all benefits of regulated gaming while exposing consumers to serious risk.”Vivanco, whose tribe has a casino in San Jacinto in Riverside County, told lawmakers that allowing virtual sweepstakes casinos to continue to operate in California will “destabilize the entire legal gaming ecosystem,” causing economic harm to communities across the state. 
In total, the various casino-owning tribes that supported the measure to kill the sweepstakes casinos have given at least $7.6 million to California’s legislators since 2015, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database. 
Card rooms and small tribes oppose
By contrast, the companies that have formally opposed AB 831 haven’t given any money to California lawmakers, according to Digital Democracy. 
The online gaming companies argue that their games are safe to play.
“The industry on its own has adopted responsible gaming measures, play limits, has user verification, has age verification,” Bill Gantz, a lawyer representing the Social Gaming Leadership Alliance, told lawmakers this summer. 
Plus, the gaming companies ask: If their business model is illegal, as the tribes claim, why does the state need a law that explicitly makes it so?
“It doesn’t pass the smell test,” said Derek Brinkman, the executive product advisor at Virtual Gaming World, one of the companies fighting AB 831.
If Newsom signs the measure, it would create new criminal penalties for companies offering the disputed sweepstakes, as well as “any entity, financial institution, payment processor, geolocation provider, gaming content supplier, platform provider or media affiliate” that supports a sweepstakes casino, according to the bill analysis. Violators would face up to a year in jail and fines of up to $25,000.
The threat of new criminal penalties, potentially even for players, is why the American Civil Liberties Union opposed the measure.  
Card rooms and the association of cities reliant on the revenue they receive from the gambling halls also opposed it. The bill doesn’t specifically target card rooms, but the tribes’ rival gambling establishments, still smarting from last year’s legislative defeat, worried their competitors would find a way to use the pending law against them.A handful of small California tribes that don’t have large casinos also opposed the measure and hope Newsom vetoes it. He has until Oct. 12 to make a decision.
Since Newsom first ran for governor in 2017, the state’s tribes have contributed more than $7 million to him through his ballot measures, his anti-recall campaign and his various candidate committees.
Eric Wright of the Klestsel Dehe Wintun Nation headquartered in Williams in the Sacramento Valley said some small tribes like his hope to team up with virtual gaming companies to try to generate revenue for their impoverished isolated communities using the sweepstakes games.  
The income would be a pittance compared to what the tribes with “brick and mortar” casinos pull in, he said.
“This is about fairness,” Wright told CalMatters. “In California gaming, the framework has worked for some tribes because of geography. But whole tribes were left out. We didn’t even get a seat on that boat.”

D.J. Waldie
D.J. Waldie is an essayist, memoirist, translator and editor. He previously served as a deputy city manager of Lakewood. His most recent book is “Elements of Los Angeles: Earth, Water, Air, Fire.”


One hundred and seventy-five years ago, our state was the prize in an unjust war whose aim was to extend slavery beyond the plantations of the South to the valleys of California. Fifty years later, those valleys were dominated by corporate agriculture (wheat, cattle, cotton and oranges) and controlled politically by railroad interests. By 1950, the future of California was in the hands of real estate developers. The valleys filled with houses and then with all of us — believers in the golden dream and disillusioned hustlers alike. At the start of a new millennium in 2000, the dreamers still arrived. Not from “back east” but from the Global South and the Asian “far west.” Developers still turned square miles of farmland into tract house suburbia. Big, old-style corporations came and went. New technologies boomed and sometimes busted, but overall, the momentum in the systems of industry, finance and labor that defined California in the mid-20th century had slowed. 
What California will be in its bicentennial year of 2050 is subject to unpredictable conditions. The nation becomes ungovernable; the San Andreas rips; drought worsens in the Colorado River watershed; AI-driven technologies deliver worst-case scenarios: social isolation, broken economies, accidental war. 
Absent these shocks, continuities will dominate California’s tomorrows. Demographic trends underway since 1990 will persist. Californians will be older, with a median age of nearly 42, up from a median age of 38 in 2025. Nearly one-quarter of us will be over 65, troubling the state’s image of youthful hedonism as well as the job market. Ethnic and political sorting will continue to send more Californians to red states and bring immigrants — in fewer numbers — to change the makeup of the political and civic organizations through which power is channeled. By 2050, nearly 50% of us will have Latino roots. The percentage of white non-Latinos will drift down to 25%. This realignment will likely bring a California-style Latino populism that disrupts conventional blue/red political binaries. 
1950s California — young, better educated, risk-taking — excelled at turning Cold War defense spending into new industries and the shiny consumer products that defined a better tomorrow. When defense spending contracted in the 1990s, university researchers and hedge fund managers propelled newer and faster technological advances. The qualities that made California uniquely a leader in innovation are less obvious now, and the global competition is stiffer. 
Forgotten are the cycles of drought that unmade the state’s cattle economy in the mid-19th century and drove titanic projects in the 20th century to bring water to places with little of their own. By 2050, we’ll use the water we have better through wastewater recycling, stormwater capture, limits on groundwater extraction, and agriculture fitted to a harsher climate regime. 
But there will always be too little water in the southern half of the state. Fundamental ecological divides — north vs. south, coast vs. inland, temperate upland forest vs. dry chaparral lowland — will still fragment the California landscape and define Californians’ unique sense of place.
The costs of a California lifestyle — particularly the cost of housing — will widen the gap between households at the top and the low- and middle-income families below. Without new and creative housing programs, less than one-third of Californians will be able to finance a median-priced home. 
Sharp differences in the quality of life between one community and another — begun by redlining neighborhoods in the 1930s — will persist. The conditions that predispose some Californians to become homeless aren’t likely to improve very much, although there may be fewer unsheltered people asleep on city streets. 
Meanwhile, corporate refugees will follow the headquarters of Oracle, Northrop Grumman and Chevron out of the state, along with new technology billionaires and their enclaves of unimaginable privilege.
The challenge for Californians in 2050 will be one of imagination: to see themselves as inheritors of a compromised but still resourceful California.
Popular movements for equity and social justice are maturing. Political initiatives for health care, education, infrastructure renewal, homelessness and housing affordability could follow. The dark magic of AI is a threat to middle-income and low-wage earners, but it could become a platform to deepen our understanding of the environment and improve educational outcomes. A state with too many unaccountable boards, commissions and special districts and too many local governments jealous of their prerogatives could learn the hard lesson that a better future will come from regional coordination — in providing law enforcement, overseeing water management, responding to natural and human caused disasters and planning for economic development.
Californians need to accept the burdens of their history and shape their aspirations accordingly. They need to imagine a different kind of California, a California of shared potential, recognizing what had been lost or squandered in becoming Californian and understanding clearly what Californians can still achieve. 
As hard as it will be to realize, the California we deserve is possible.

(Photo: Nevada Strategic Growth Initiative)Nevada is the only state in the nation that can deliver on every phase of the lithium life cycle – from mining to recycling.
Industry experts in the state say that selling point has the potential to make Nevada a leader in the lithium battery supply chain that powers everything from electric vehicles to the data centers driving AI growth. 
Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo emphasized the importance of lithium for diversifying Nevada’s tourism-heavy economy at his second annual Nevada Lithium Summit Friday.
The lithium industry, however, has been hammered by falling prices in recent years due to softer demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally, which has made mining the metal in the U.S. less attractive to investors.
On the second day of the lithium summit, Politico reported the Department of Energy (DOE) was reevaluating a $2.3 billion loan to the Thacker Pass lithium project, a massive proposed mine in Humboldt County near the Nevada-Oregon border. The energy agency cited the drop in price as a key factor in their rethink of the loan.
During the summit, Lombardo said the Thacker Pass lithium project – the largest known lithium deposit in North America – positioned Nevada as “a key player in both national and global supply chains.”
Thacker Pass isn’t the only lithium mine in Nevada feeling the impact of falling lithium prices. Earlier this year, mining developer Ioneer Corp. lost a $490 million investment to their Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project in Esmeralda County after their investing partner backed out of the project, due in part to plummeting lithium prices.
Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said average lithium fell from nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022 to about $10,000 per tonne this September. Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile the remainder of the year.
“Commodities ebb and flow,” said Tom Burns, the director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED), during a press conference at the summit. 
Despite falling prices, Burns said Nevada’s position as the only state in the nation with a complete “Lithium Loop” that could offer mining and processing to battery manufacturing and recycling gave the state an edge for investment.
More investment from the federal government isn’t off the table, said Burns. President Donald Trump has made reducing foreign critical mineral dependency a major priority, citing national and economic security concerns. Nevada is poised to meet that need, said Burns.
“There is movement within the federal government to support critical minerals and mining and processing as a whole,” Burns said. “I think you’ll see that in Nevada.”
“Specifically, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy has an interest in making sure those are produced here,” Burns continued.
Nevada Battery Coalition CEO Caleb Cage said industry experts believe the growing demand for lithium and battery storage will increase and stabilize prices for the metal over the next decade.
“Looking at it long term, the remarkable demand for lithium in particular should have the market effect of adjusting that price to make some of these projects more viable,” Cage said. 
“The demand for battery storage is only growing right now,” Cage said. 
Growing battery storage demand has already boosted Nevada’s economy. A decade ago, about 100 people were employed in the battery manufacturing industry, according to GOED. In 2025, more than 14,200 were employed in the industry. 
Manufacturing grew by about 83% in Nevada from 2015 to 2025, significantly more than the 13% national average. That growth was largely driven by the battery manufacturing industry boosted by electric vehicles and clean energy demands. 
Several companies have invested in battery manufacturing and recycling facilities in Nevada, including Tesla and Redwood Materials.
Major tech companies are now also investing heavily in large AI-enabled data centers, and lithium battery storage will be a part of that, said Cage.
Electricity demand in the U.S. has continued to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028. Those data centers will need battery storage systems to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.
Growing adoption of renewable energy sources, sustainability objectives, and need for energy efficiency is also driving the transition away from traditional lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion batteries in data centers.
In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy to build low-cost energy-storage systems that can meet surging power demand from AI data centers. The company said it’s already powering a modular data center in Sparks, Nevada for AI infrastructure company Cursoe at an energy cost lower than the grid.
“They’ve got that proof of concept out in Northern Nevada right now, and that model is going to be something that they want to replicate,” Cage said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lithiumboom-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

(Courtesy of Ivory Innovations) Utah’s most expensive housing prices in Summit and Wasatch counties — home to high-end ski resorts and popular mountain towns of Park City, Heber and Kamas — are in the millions. 
In Park City, the median single family home sells for $3.95 million, and condos sell for $1.85 million, according to the Park City Board of Realtors’ latest data. In the larger market areas of Summit and Wasatch counties, the median price of a single-family home is $1.79 million, while condos go for $1.12 million. 
But on the western edge of Summit County, in the small city of Francis — about a 25 minute drive to Park City or Heber — a Utah home builder is trying to help provide more relatively affordable options for working-class people wanting to live in the mountains. And the company says it’s prioritizing selling and renting to “essential workers” including teachers, first-responders, and local small business employees. 
Utah governor doubles down on goal to build 35K homes in 5 years 

“Essential workers shouldn’t have to choose between an hour-plus commute and living in the community they serve,” said Clark Ivory, CEO of Utah’s largest home building company, Ivory Homes.
Ivory Innovations — the nonprofit arm of Ivory Homes and an academic center based at the University of Utah David Eccles School of Business that’s focused on solutions for affordable housing — held a ribbon cutting ceremony on Tuesday for the development, named Innovation Park at Francis Commons. 
Ivory called it the “first step to ensuring that the teachers educating our children, first responders protecting our families and health care workers caring for our community can afford to live where they work.”
“This development proves we can create high-quality affordable housing, even in Utah’s most expensive markets,” he said. 
The Francis Commons project includes 64 townhomes and 30 single-family homes for sale, though all 30 of the single-family homes have already sold. The townhomes are priced below $470,000, while the single-family homes were priced in the low $600,000 range.

Sixteen townhomes have also been set aside as rentals that are income-restricted for individuals making a salary of up to roughly $70,000 or families of three making up to about $90,000, Ivory said. 
Rent for a two-bedroom unit for someone making 60% of the area median income would be about $1,990 a month, according to the development’s website. For someone making 80% of the area median income, rent would be about $2,241. 
That may not seem affordable to many. But the average income of Utah’s median household is about $98,000, according to a report published in April by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. After adjusting for cost-of-living differences between states, the report said that puts Utah’s median household income highest in the country, and nearly 27% higher than the U.S. average of $77,719. 
And those prices are still hundreds of thousands of dollars lower than Summit County and Wasatch County’s median home prices. 
For the owner-occupied homes, Ivory said he’s only selling to people who are living there full time.
“If they’re buying a single-family home or a townhome, they need to commit to us that they’re going to be a primary resident. We’re not selling to investors. We’re not selling to those who want a second home up here in Summit County,” Ivory said. “We’re selling to those that are working here and making it happen in the community.”
The development was created through a partnership with Ivory Homes, the Call to Action Foundation and Francis city leaders as part of Ivory Homes’ larger Francis Commons subdivision master plan.

The partnership has committed to build 1,500 affordable homes across Utah — in support of Gov. Spencer Cox’s goal to build 35,000 starter homes in the state by 2028. The governor has set housing affordability as a top priority for his administration, as the state has faced skyrocketing housing prices, especially over the last five years, while also grappling with a housing shortage that experts have estimated at more than 37,000 units and counting. 
But there’s still a long way to go toward fulfilling Cox’s goal. 
So far 5,801 starter homes have been built — most of which (2,814) are concentrated in Utah County — according to the state’s housing dashboard. 
Cox, in a post on X earlier this month, acknowledged “we know there’s more to do.” He encouraged Utahns to “track our progress” toward the goal on that dashboard. 
Francis Mayor Jeremie Forman said affordable housing has been a “big challenge,” but he applauded the development with Ivory Homes as a “really big deal.”
“The ability to have full-time residents here in Francis that are able to afford to live here, to work here, raise their families here, that builds a sense of community that a second-home community does not build,” he said. “So we’re super excited to have this product here. Hopefully others will follow suit.”

But a 2000 omnibus pay bill that allowed local officials to increase compensation for local officials in the form of expense accounts and at least three Alabama attorney general’s opinions that say expense accounts are not compensation allow lawmakers to raise local officials’ renumeration before they complete a term.
Legislators during the most recent session filed nearly 25 bills that dealt with the compensation of county officials, according to a tabulation by the Alabama Reflector.

18 of the bills, almost 75%, were approved by the Legislature and eventually signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey.
While the bills filed in the 2025 session that focused on pay raises dealt with different offices, the majority of them, almost 80%, were meant to provide increases to either sheriffs or probate judges. Some examples:

HB 452, sponsored by Rep. Kerry Underwood, R-Tuscumbia, increases the expense account for the Colbert County sheriff so that the total compensation for the sheriff will rise from $50,000 per year to $96,000 per year effective Oct. 1, with the money converting to salary in January 2027.
HB 500, sponsored by Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, increases the Lawrence County sheriff’s expense account to ensure the sheriff receives compensation equal to a yearly equivalent of $95,000 from Oct. 1 through Jan. 19 of next year, at which point the money will convert to salary.
HB 431, sponsored by Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, created a $15,000 expense account for the Monroe County Sheriff through January 2027, when it will convert to salary.
SB 339, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, was an explicit salary increase for the Madison County sheriff, raising yearly pay from $154,000 to , $170,000 effective June 1, without a reference to expense accounts.

A message was left with the county commissions of the two counties and Givhan seeking comment.
Advocates for law enforcement said that the salary increases are necessary to attract the best candidates for the job.
“From my personal experience in Baldwin County, I had three, if not four, police chiefs who made more money than I did,” said Hoss Mack, executive director of the Alabama Sheriffs Association. “It is not just about the money; it is about attracting people to run for the office.”
Rep. Randy Wood, R-Anniston, who introduced legislation to increase the compensation of the Talladega County Sheriff that did not pass, said that sheriffs in other counties received pay increases already and that the legislation introduced in the spring was supposed to reduce the disparities in the salaries between other sheriffs who oversee departments with similar populations and a similar geographic area.
Wood said part of the reason for his bill, HB 434, was because sheriffs lost one avenue to raise revenue when the Legislature made it optional for people to purchase a pistol permit for carrying a firearm. Money from the sale of pistol permit fees partially funded the operations of sheriffs offices throughout the state, but were not typically used for salaries.
“That was a large sum of money that kept the sheriffs’ office going,” Wood said. “Talladega was one of the counties that lost it.”
How it works
Amendment 92 to the Alabama Constitution states that “neither the legislature, nor any county of the state shall, by the imposition of new, different, and additional duties or otherwise, increase, or authorize the increase of, the salary, fees or other compensation of any officer of the state or of any county of the state, who is elected or appointed for a fixed term, during the term for which he is elected or appointed.”
But an omnibus pay bill passed by the Legislature in 2000, which established baseline salaries for local officials, allows legislators to “increase the compensation for local officials” by local legislation.
Local elected officials are also “entitled to receive the same uniform increases in compensation, whether the uniform increases are based on a percentage of compensation or a flat dollar amount, that are granted equally to all county employees by the county commission.”
“The work around is to immediately grant an expense allowance and have that roll into the salary at the start of the next term,” said Othni Lathram, director of the Alabama Legislative Services Agency, in a statement.
Most of these increases pass through with little notice. Unlike general bills, local bills are rarely if ever publicly debated on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives or the Alabama Senate. While larger counties like Jefferson and Mobile have committees that hold public hearings on local legislation, most local bills move at the pleasure of the lawmakers who represent those areas.
‘Not compensation or renumeration’
The 2000 omnibus bill set minimum salaries and provided conditions for fixed pay increases while allowing legislators to increase pay for county officials through local law. It also allowed elected officials to receive merit raises given to other employees in the form of expense allowances.
“The omnibus act does not, and cannot, jump over the prohibition against receiving a ‘salary’ increase during your term. The prohibition is in the constitution and we can’t supersede the constitution with a statute,” said Sonny Brasfield, the executive director of the Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA).  “This issue gets even more complicated when you start looking at the provisions of local laws that provide immediate expense allowances — not an increase in salary — during the term of office.  The attorney general has issued many opinions making a distinction between expense allowances and salary increases.”
Since at least 1980, the Alabama attorney general’s office has considered expenses separate from compensation. In an opinion that year, then-Attorney General Charles Graddick wrote that “the expenses of public officers in the performance of their official duties are distinct and not included in the compensation allowed them, and therefore the reimbursement of public officers for such expenses is not subject to constitutional prohibitions against the alteration of compensation during the term of office.”
In a 2002 opinion, then-Attorney General Bill Pryor wrote that elected officials were entitled to merit raises awarded under the 2000 omnibus act. Pryor wrote that with the constitutional prohibition, officials “must be paid the increase in the form of an expense allowance until the commencement of their next term of office when that portion of their expense allowance will be converted into salary.”
In a 2005 opinion on the compensation of supernumerary sheriffs, then-Attorney General Troy King cited Graddick’s 1980 opinion, and wrote that expense allowances were “not compensation or renumeration.”
“The constitution prohibits salary increases during the term of office; it does not prohibit expense allowances,” Brasfield said. “Many local laws provide for the elected officials to receive an immediate expense allowance that goes away at the start of the next term and is replaced by a salary increase. This is a long-standing practice and isn’t something new at all.”
Mack added that the sheriff’s office in each of the respective counties has additional responsibilities that police chiefs may not have.
“The sheriff runs the county jail,” Mack said. “They are the only officers of the court for law enforcement, so they are executing all of the paperwork that comes from the circuit and district court. The sheriff is also one of the three managers over all the elections: the sheriff, circuit clerk and the probate judge oversee all of the county, state and federal elections in every county in the state.”
‘What the county commission wants’
Legislators said the requests for compensation increases came from local officials, and not necessarily those getting the added money.
“I didn’t really look at it as playing games with the rules,” said Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, who sponsored legislation to give the Calhoun County sheriff a pay raise. “I think we set it up on information that we had at the time and were looking at a number of other things. We were looking at county expenses, income, and things like that, to retain a consistency there.”
Rep. Reed, Ingram, R-Pike Road, sponsored HB 424, which would have increased the Montgomery County Sheriff’s compensation by $50,000 prior to the completion of his term. Ingram said he goes “by what the county commission wants.”
“It was their resolution and that was the way they wanted it,” he said. “Showing bipartisan support, I felt like they had already vested it out. All we do is carry the bill.”
HB 424 was not enacted into law, a casualty of the time limit on the Legislature.
Mack said the practice was the only way to provide sheriffs with a pay raise without having to wait until the start of a new term.
“The timing is on a case by case issue. In some cases the sheriff may not have had a pay increase in years and may have worked with the local legislative delegation to start the process,” he said in a statement. “Sometimes it may take 1-3 years to get the legislation passed.  It may get held up in committee or not placed on the calendar for a vote due to other legislation being considered or a filibuster. This system is not perfect because you are dealing with 67 counties with various populations and very different budgets.”
Mack said that the increase in the expense account does not apply to retirement, and the sheriff will not get credit for the additional pay until the following term of office.
Brasfield said the law was “a recognition that individual salary increases should be decided on a county-by-county basis.”
“Because the responsibilities of the elected officials vary so much and because the financial condition of the county commissions are also very different, we felt these issues could be more effectively addressed with local legislation,” he said in a statement.
The ACCA supports the current process as the local bills to raise salaries were negotiated among the county commissioners, the body that funds the salary increases, and the legislators who introduced the bills.
“That process has served the taxpayers very well.” Brasfield said. “I think it has also served the elected officials very well. That legislation came from inside our organization as a way to try and eliminate what, at the time, was an almost constant fight in the Legislature over elected official salaries.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Statehouse-0747-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Trump administration officials, looking at the possible impact of large insurance premium increases for millions of next year’s Obamacare customers, want more people to consider plans with less generous benefits and high deductibles.
The agency that oversees the ACA announced early this month that it would expand eligibility for “catastrophic” plans sold in Affordable Care Act online marketplaces. The plans require people to spend more than $10,000 a year on deductibles before the policies pay most medical costs but carry lower monthly premiums than other Obamacare policies.
The move reflects growing concern among Republicans about political backlash if Congress doesn’t extend larger tax credits put in place during the covid-19 public health emergency to help consumers pay their premiums. The extra subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year, resulting in an average 75% increase in the amount people pay for coverage, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
A small, bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced legislation to extend the enhanced covid-era subsidies for one more year, which would keep them in place through midterm congressional elections in fall 2026.
But the fate of that legislation is uncertain, with many Republicans opposed to extending the extra tax credits, with a permanent change costing at least $335 billion over 10 years. Without an extension, tax credit amounts would revert to pre-pandemic levels.
“They spent the last 15 years against the ACA, so a lot will be steadfast, but others are worried about the effect of massively spiked premiums on their constituents,” noted a Democratic Senate staffer who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.
Republicans currently control Congress by slim margins, raising the stakes if voters who lose their ACA tax credits blame them at the ballot box.
Catastrophic plans are a little-known type of Obamacare policy that have previously been limited mainly to people under age 30. While they come with lower monthly premiums than other types of ACA plans, the coverage has higher annual deductibles, which are set at the out-of-pocket maximum for the year: $10,600 for individuals in 2026 or $21,200 for families.
A deductible is the amount patients must spend on health care before insurance plans pay for most services. Catastrophic plans do cover three primary care visits a year without having to pay the full deductible and, as with other ACA policies, policyholders pay nothing for preventive services such as some cancer screenings and vaccines.
The catastrophic plans will automatically show up on the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, for consumers who lose tax credit coverage entirely next year due to their household income. Another category of consumers — people who continue to qualify for tax credits but not for subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs — may also be eligible but would have to send in paperwork.
“By expanding access to catastrophic plans, we are making sure hardworking people who face unexpected hardships can get affordable coverage that protects them from devastating medical costs,” Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement.
It isn’t clear whether the policy changes will make the plans more attractive to consumers. Catastrophic plans aren’t available in all states, and the size of the deductibles can be off-putting.
“It’s a ton of money,” said Louise Norris, a health insurance analyst and broker who writes regularly about the ACA. “A full-price catastrophic plan is still more expensive than some people can afford, but they’re doing this to offer a slightly more affordable option.”
Catastrophic plans have had limited appeal, with only about 54,000 out of Obamacare’s 24 million enrollees currently opting for the coverage, according to government data, Norris said.
“Uptake has always been quite low,” said Katie Keith, director of the O’Neill Institute’s Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. “It’s not a bad option if it is the only option you have. I question whether consumers are looking for this kind of coverage.”
CMS plans to grant people a “hardship” designation to enroll in catastrophic plans if they lose eligibility for ACA tax credits next year. Most likely to qualify are people earning more than four times the federal poverty rate ($62,600 for an individual this year, or $106,600 for a family of three), who will lose access to all premium subsidies if Congress does not extend the current enhanced tax credits. It’s also unclear how much premiums will cost. Insurers, reacting to the new administration guidance, might seek to recalculate their rates based on what they estimate may be an influx of older people into the plans, Norris said.
AHIP, the insurance industry lobbying group, is pushing hard for the larger tax credits to be extended. It did not comment specifically on how the new guidance might affect catastrophic health plan premiums. Still, AHIP spokesperson Chris Bond said that “while catastrophic plans can provide important coverage for specific needs, they are not a replacement for affordable comprehensive coverage.”
There are other hurdles. Norris said insurers don’t offer plans at all in 10 states: Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, and Wyoming. And where they are available, options are few. This year, for example, a 25-year-old in Orlando, Florida, had a choice of 61 “bronze” plans, the cheapest level of coverage available to all ACA shoppers, but just three catastrophic plans.
Policy experts say the expanded eligibility for catastrophic plans makes it more important than ever for consumers to consider all options when shopping for ACA coverage during the annual open enrollment period, which starts Nov. 1. In addition to the catastrophic and bronze plans, there are also “silver” and “gold” plans, each with varying premiums and deductibles.
Bronze plans have the lowest premiums but the highest deductibles; the average bronze deductible this year is $7,186, which is still lower than the catastrophic plans, according to KFF.
Catastrophic plan deductibles, while high, are comparable to some bronze plans, Norris noted. People who choose catastrophic plans are not eligible for any ACA tax subsidies to help pay monthly premiums.
A pending court battle may provide lawmakers concerned about voter pushback on Obamacare changes an unintended reprieve.
In late August, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily put on hold some changes the Trump administration had ordered for next year. Those changes, included in a June regulatory filing by the administration, would have added additional verification paperwork requirements for some people enrolling in ACA plans, and were challenged by several cities, which cited government estimates that the changes could cause up to 1.8 million people to lose their insurance in 2026.
The court ruling stayed several provisions of the Trump administration rules, including income verification requirements that would affect people below the poverty level and those without tax return information. The move also paused verification requirements affecting people who apply outside the annual open enrollment period and blocked a $5 monthly charge for people who are automatically enrolled into plans in which subsidies cover the entire premium — unless they contact the marketplace and confirm their selection.
The Trump administration is appealing the decision, but the case may not be settled until next year, said Keith at Georgetown University.
That makes it likely that the pause of the new requirements will stay in place for this year’s open enrollment season.
Keith said the ruling was a “bigger deal” than expanding eligibility for catastrophic plans. “Consumers all across the country won’t have to deal with red tape the Trump administration rushed to put into place ahead of the new plan year,” and the ruling also “helps people keep their coverage.”

(Photo courtesy of USC)COLUMBIA — The University of South Carolina is seeking a partner to help run its new $30 million brain health clinic scheduled to open in March in downtown Columbia.
The center will house the most powerful MRI scanner in the state and be staffed by neurologists and radiologists with the necessary training to diagnose the most complicated cases of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia, said Julius Fridriksson, USC’s vice president for research.
The state’s largest university system is looking for a management company to staff and run the clinic on a day-to-day basis.
The center is located in a renovated 75,000-square-foot building the school owns on the Prisma Health Richland Hospital campus. It will be the main hub in a network of seven clinics already set up across the state in an effort to increase access to brain-related disease research and cutting-edge treatments, even in rural areas.
Since opening its first clinic in partnership with Prisma Health more than a year ago in Winnsboro, the USC Brain Health Network has seen more than 1,000 patients, and the number of visits keeps increasing, Fridriksson said.
What USC’s planned $350M neurological hospital could mean for SC

While awaiting the new center’s completion, USC medical school doctors have been booking appointments more than four days a week in university-leased space within the neurology department of Prisma’s Richland Hospital.
“So the Brain Health Center can’t come online fast enough,” Fridriksson said.
Also at the center, those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s will have the option to undergo treatment with recently approved drugs meant to slow the disease’s progression.
While Alzheimer’s makes up less than half of all dementia cases in South Carolina, those that are diagnosed early with the disease could greatly benefit from the state-of-the-art drugs, which received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval just last year.
“The drugs are good,” Fridriksson said. “I mean, if it was me or a family member that was starting to show signs of cognitive decline and the workup revealed that it is most likely Alzheimer’s disease, I’d do it in a heartbeat.”
The center will have six infusion rooms where patients can get their monthly treatment. The Medical University of South Carolina health system and Prisma offer these injectable drug treatments but on a smaller scale, Fridriksson said.
USC building $30M brain health center for Alzheimer’s, dementia treatment

“I think it’s the first time in my time as a researcher that we’ve had any significant improvement in managing Alzheimer’s disease,” he added. “And I hope that as many people can get those drugs as possible.”
But the drug does not come without risks, including a chance of stroke.
Part of administering it is having a powerful enough MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanner and a team of specially trained physicians to be sure the patient has Alzheimer’s rather than a different form of dementia that wouldn’t benefit from the treatment.
At the center, that will include a 7-tesla MRI scanner with a magnet strong enough to generate images of the brain with minute detail, as well as a 3-tesla scanner.
Tesla is a scientific term for the strength of a magnet. By comparison, most hospital MRI machines are just 1.5-tesla.
USC has collected bids from companies interested in joining in the center’s operations and receiving a share of the revenues. According to the public procurement schedule, the winning bid will be posted online Dec. 16.
If a suitable partner isn’t found, the school will consider running the center itself, Fridriksson said.
After all, it’s a sector of health care that does not generate a profit.
SC hospitals to give dementia patients more extensive care with federal program

“The Brain Health Network wouldn’t be needed if there was a lot of money to be made,” Fridriksson said. “There’s a reason why the big players are not rushing into this space.”
The network — with locations in Sumter, Seneca, Orangeburg, Lexington and Darlington, in addition to Winnsboro and Columbia — is run using $5 million in taxpayer dollars annually. So, while a potential partner isn’t likely to earn much, it won’t risk losing money.
The real benefit, according to Fridriksson, is the prestige of partnering with a major state research university. He said the relationship and the potential for participating in college-run research and clinical trials could be a recruiting tool for health care providers trying to hire the best doctors.
“So, for a hospital, if you want to attract physicians and nurses who want to be involved in cutting-edge stuff, partner with us,” Fridriksson said. “Even though these new drugs are coming online, there’s a lot more work to be done.”

The brain health clinic is located a half mile from the site of USC’s new $300 million School of Medicine campus, set for completion in 2027, and a $350 million neurological hospital and rehabilitation center planned for downtown Columbia’s BullStreet District. The Legislature provided $150 million this year toward the specialized hospital for neurological diseases.
The broader plans are another selling point for doctors and researchers considering a career in South Carolina.
Fridriksson imagines technological advances within the next decade that could help quadriplegics control their limbs and walk using brain implants and exoskeleton. Those suffering from locked-in syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that causes paralysis of all muscles except for those that control eye movements, could be able to speak through a computerized voice machine controlled by implants.
“We know that treatment is advancing with artificial intelligence and neuroscience,” Fridriksson said. “Rehab is going to be very different five years from now. And having the hospital be in the thick of that, the timing could not be better.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/braincenter-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)To Christopher Roberts, president, Auburn University:
Last week, you announced that you fired Auburn employees over “insensitive” social media posts. But you left a lot of unanswered questions, such as:
1. How many employees were actually fired?
2. What was the point of not disclosing the number of employees you had sacked? Was there some personnel issue here? Not doing so would suggest an attempt to intimidate Auburn workers.
3. What exactly was posted that led to these firings? Were these done by people speaking in their positions as Auburn employees, or as private citizens expressing their opinions?
4. You wrote that “actions that endorse, glorify or trivialize violence . . . have no place at Auburn.” Agreed. So if these posts did so, why not quote them or show the kind of speech you see as condoning violence, to ensure people are clear on what condoning violence is? Keeping them in the dark would appear to create uncertainty and compel silence from the people who work for you.
5. You made this announcement after U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville spent Wednesday morning away from the nation’s business to make Facebook posts complaining about public comments in the wake of far-right activist Charlie Kirk’s killing. Did Sen. Tuberville influence your decision? He sure seemed happy with your announcement.
6. Speaking of which, you said the posts were at odds with “Auburn’s values of respect, integrity and responsibility.” So I have to ask: Considering your belief in those values, will Sen. Tuberville be barred from speaking on campus?
7. Do I have to remind you why? Just in case:

        a. In 2022, Tuberville said at a Nevada political rally that descendants of enslaved people “do the crime.”
b. In 2023, Tuberville took months to condemn white nationalism, often retreating to claims of victimhood when challenged.
c. In 2024, he said most immigrants “are garbage.”
d. Last June, he referred to people who live in urban areas as “inner-city rats.”
e. In the same interview, he said Muslim-American immigrants in Alabama would “overwhelm us” and that “we have to fight back.”
f. And if none of this seems like a problem to you, you might note that Tuberville last year said U.S. Sen. Katie Britt — a former Business Council of Alabama CEO and the soon-to-be senior senator from Alabama — delivered the response to then-President Joe Biden’s State of the Union because she was “picked as a housewife.”

8. You’re aware that this is just a sampling of some of the despicable things Tuberville, now running for Alabama governor, has said?
9. So would you allow someone to speak on campus who has repeatedly shown zero respect to nonwhite Alabamians and little responsibility in what he says? Or is there a different set of standards for people like Tuberville?
10. Do you remember when white nationalist Richard Spencer spoke at Auburn in 2017? Boy, was that a mess. Auburn somehow let Spencer rent a hall, then tried to cancel his appearance. Not because Spencer believes in the creation of a white ethnostate; advocates ethnic cleansing and spreads false, hateful rhetoric that white people are more intelligent than other races, but because of “public safety.” Spencer got an injunction against the university and spoke regardless.
11. So, just curious: Considering your concerns about “respect, integrity and responsibility,” can you make a guarantee to the Auburn student body, particularly the women and minorities in it, that Auburn will oppose any speaker on campus who would call for anyone’s forced exclusion from public life because of some innate characteristic? Or who calls for their forced expulsion from the country of their birth? Or will you stand by and shrug about “free speech” as your students and colleagues get threatened?
12. Oh, speaking of which: When posting that letter about firing employees, did you take the time to email Auburn’s workforce? I mean, if you’re going to make a major decision about the employment status of their colleagues and the university’s policies about what can and can’t be said, you should have the courtesy to first inform the people most affected by it, right?
13. Or was this whole thing — the vagueness, the menace, the veiled threats — done for Tuberville?
I fear that I already know the answers to these questions. After all, you and your colleagues at the University of Alabama folded faster than a raincoat when state officials began menacing Black and LGBTQ+ students on your campuses. Whenever there’s been a clash between a better future for our state and bowing to the petty hatreds of the political present, our universities’ administrators have shown a distressing tendency to go for the latter.
But if Auburn is going to start obsessively monitoring employees’ comments on public events, you should at least let your workers know what is and isn’t free speech. And who gets to speak freely at Auburn, and who doesn’t.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Auburn-University-04-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

(Courtesy New Mexico Historic Sites)Just after a Civil War infantry re-enactment during Fort Stanton’s annual celebration, as Mescalero Apache dancers suited up for a warrior dance, the fort’s manager Oliver Horn stepped onto the stoop of the site’s old guardhouse in order to address a few dozen people gathered there — some of them costumed like Union soldiers.
“There was a real chance that we would have lost this amazing location of such rich New Mexico heritage and culture and history if it wasn’t for them,” Horn said, gesturing to a group of firefighters from different agencies lined up on either side of him. “We would not be here.”
Horn’s words on Aug. 23 referenced the Camp Fire, which had burned during Memorial Day weekend a few months prior and threatened to destroy the historic site. 
First established in southeastern New Mexico in 1855 as a base to ward off Mescalero Apache raids, Fort Stanton since that time has hosted an array of historical figures like Billy The Kid and Kit Carson. Buffalo Soldiers posted there; tuberculosis patients received treatment in its halls; and the United States interned German sailors there during World War II.
This year’s annual celebration acknowledged much of that history, but Horn also took a moment to honor more than a dozen firefighters from local, state and federal agencies who represented the 150 or so who responded to the blaze. He presented them with plaques commemorating their “exemplary actions in protecting and preserving the culture and history in New Mexico,” in an effort he said amounts to the largest firefighting operation to save a cultural resource in New Mexico history.
After honoring the firefighters, Horn walked from the guardhouse across the fort’s courtyard, where the Buffalo Soldiers regimental band once practiced, and entered its chapel, first built in 1913.

There, amid the periodic booms of cannon blasts from the other side of the courtyard, he presented to a handful of attendees his approach to keeping the fort resilient to wildfire despite being in one of the most “fire-prone areas in New Mexico.” 
While the firefighters’ work on the Camp Fire was crucial, the fort still stands today, Horn contends, due to a multi-agency effort over the past few years to protect it from wildfire and counteract mistakes made over the last couple centuries. It’s an effort he thinks serves as a model for others trying to protect cultural resources amid increasing wildfire risk, and has improved safety ratings, he said, for the area’s volunteer fire department, which keeps homeowner’s insurance affordable in a county where prices are skyrocketing elsewhere. 
“Essentially our water system, our infrastructure, helps protect nearly a billion dollars in private property in this county,” he said. “What I’m hopeful for is that if we can execute this project, it will be a model for other communities across New Mexico to establish defensible space for themselves.”
While the project Horn embarked on is making significant progress, he said, much is left to be done, including restoring an acequia irrigation system surrounding the courtyard and removing a stand of dead and dying Siberian elms: “noxious weeds” that can catapult any wildfire into the historic buildings Horn is trying desperately to preserve. 
So Horn said he panicked when he got the call about the wildfire barreling toward Fort Stanton. His mind flashed to the elms. He thought to himself, “I just need a few more years.”
Holding the fort
It was about 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 24 when a nearby landowner spotted smoke at the Fort and called 911. Jake Canavan, chief of the volunteer Lincoln Fire Department, showed up a few minutes later, followed by Lincoln County Manager Arron Griewahn, who took over command of the situation.
According to public records, firefighter accounts and Horn’s eyewitness testimony, Griewahn and Canavan then paged firefighters across the county, reporting that a northeasterly wind pointed the blaze directly at the fort. About 50 local volunteers arrived quickly, and the State Forestry division, which is building its own teams of professional fire crews, dispatched two engines from its headquarters in nearby Capitan.
Federal agencies, including the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, heard about the fire over the radio and dispatched teams from the nearby ranger office in Ruidoso. One of those teams was a helitack Hotshot crew from Mississippi that was deployed to high-fire-risk areas.
About 150 firefighters ultimately mobilized to fight the blaze, which quickly spread more than a mile toward the fort, crawling along the Rio Bonito valley lined with dry grass, junipers and piñons.

Within hours, the blaze descended one side of a valley, rushed toward the Rio Bonito and destroyed three historic buildings, including a gymnasium used by interned German soldiers and two wooden structures the Civilian Conservation Corps built in the 1930s. 
If the fire had kept going up the other side of the valley, it would have fed on an outcropping of dead or dying Siberian elms that were first introduced during the Dust Bowl, launching it further toward the fort. 
Just beyond the elms sat the rest of Fort Stanton’s historic buildings, many of them with wood shake roofs. Canavan said a single ember on one of those old roofs could have destroyed the entire fort. 
“It would have caught some of those wood shake shingles on fire,” he said. “Once one of those buildings goes, it’s gonna be a bad day.”
But no ember made it past firefighters, Canavan said. They stood on the edge of the ridge with the blaze below them and the fort behind them. They had quick access to all the water they needed, thanks to the hydrants, and the helicopter pilot from Mississippi had access to a nearby dip site Canavan previously staged there. 
Even with the blaze only 4% contained on May 26, incident commanders reported that fire lines had held, sparing the fort any further damage. By May 29, the blaze was 87% contained and largely out.
The fire burned about 875 acres. Its cause is still being investigated. 
A fire ‘170 years in the making’
Once the fire was out, Horn — who was born and raised in Albuquerque but drawn to Fort Stanton after getting  a Ph.D in history from Notre Dame — wrote an essay laying out what he saw as the long threads of history that culminated with the Memorial Day weekend conflagration, a fire he sees as “170 years in the making.”
Horn maintains that the buildup of fuels in the area has largely been uninterrupted since Carson’s troops forced the Mescaleros to Bosque Redondo in 1862. The thinning and other work in the area is vital, he says, to restore the landscape to the way it looked for thousands of years, when the Mescaleros regularly used fire on the landscape.

A photograph, circa 1870, shows a band of Mescalero Apaches outside the newly built fort. Open grassland surrounds it. Horn attributes that emptiness to the longstanding Mescalero practice of setting fire to the grassland, which burned dead plant material, provided nutrients and prevented large-scale fires. 
The Mescaleros were enduring “hellish” conditions at Bosque Redondo between 1862 and 1865, according to Horn, and never returned to the grasslands after they left the forced reservation. Instead, the Mescaleros moved into the safety of the mountains nearby, what is now the town of Mescalero. 
In doing so, they surrendered the grassland below to ranchers, who introduced tens of thousands of cattle to the landscape. 
“And so what the cattle did is they started feeding the grass, and they tore up the grass, which created space for those saplings to take root and expand. And these forests, whether piñon-junipers down here in the lowlands, or the Douglas fir forests up in the mountains, started to increase in density,” Horn said during his presentation. 
Enter the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, which prompted the United States Agriculture Department to introduce the drought- and cold-resistant Siberian elm, which has since reproduced around the fort.
Today, a photographer capturing an image from the same vantage point as the photographer did back in 1870 would see a landscape cluttered with piñons and junipers, along with a build-up of Siberian elms around the fort’s perimeter, all desiccated by drought or riddled with disease and, as a result, rendered highly combustible.
“The USDA had the best of intentions at the time in terms of planning these Siberian elms,” Horn said. “Today, communities across New Mexico are trying to figure out ways to get rid of these trees. They are highly, highly invasive.”
 ‘It felt good to win’
The state’s Department of Cultural Affairs has invested about $8 million in capital projects recently, including $3.5 million on upgrading the water system. Improvements include replacing the visitor center’s old wood shake roof with synthetic material and installing 17 fire hydrants; and they have a plan and a $300,000 federal grant to replace invasive Siberian elms with native oaks. 
The Bureau of Land Management has also conducted multiple thinning and prescribed burns in the area in recent years, including in the area where the Camp Fire burned between May 25 and 30. According to a Source New Mexico review, the BLM has done more than 140 fuel treatments in the area since 1995; more than a third of those were in the last five years. 
Subsequently, Fort Stanton’s survival stands in stark contrast to other recent Lincoln County disasters. The McBride Fire in 2022, along with the South Fork and Salt Fire last summer, continue to wreak havoc on the Ruidoso area about 20 miles south of the fort, where deadly post-fire flooding occurs each monsoon season and homeowners insurance rates are growing increasingly unaffordable.

Canavan told Source that, as a result of fire hydrants and recent investments, a half-dozen homeowners approached him this summer and told him that they’d actually gotten rebates from their insurance companies, “which is unheard of,” he said. 
In addition to the recent investments, Canavan cited the quick mobilization of firefighters as the reason they were able to save the fort. 
And he and Griewahn also noted the thinning in the area, which helped them hold the fire “in check” and “get around it,” Griewahn said, pointing across the Rio Bonito, at a sparse array of slightly charred junipers and a landscape that bears the closest resemblance in the area to Horn’s old pictures of the pre-fort desert.
Griewahn, who has been in the thick of those natural disasters, told Source that the fort’s survival is worth celebrating. 
“I don’t want to use the wrong term, so to speak. But it felt good to ‘win,’” Griewahn said as he looked out over the Camp Fire burn scar, which stopped a few hundred feet from where he stood. “For us to get a fire stopped, and for us to meet our objectives and save all these buildings, it felt good to finally win.”
After looking at the burn scar, Griewahn and Canavan returned to the fort’s courtyard, taking shade under an antique fire truck next to a group of Civil War re-enactors, who were taking down their tent at the end of a long and festive day.
They watched children playing tag across the historic courtyard, running under an American flag lightly flapping in a mild breeze.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Public health advocates are hoping Maryland’s participation in the newly formed Northeast Public Health Collaborative will help bring clarity to ongoing “confusion” around vaccine recommendations under the Trump administration — but how well that  group messaging works is yet to be seen.
“Time will tell – I hope it clarifies,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All Coalition. “I hope that a group of experts advises this coalition of states so that what they put out is trustworthy. Vaccines are critical for public health and we think it’s absolutely critical that everybody be able to get a vaccine if they want it.”
Maryland has joined a newly formed coalition of states trying to counter the Trump administration’s effort to restrict certain vaccine use — challenging longstanding public health wisdom that vaccinations are safe and effective.
The Maryland Department of Health announced its participation in the cohort of states last week. Other states involved in the collaborative include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. New York City is also a major player.
The state health department also released a set of vaccine recommendations for various respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV.
Health advocates worry feds’ new COVID vaccine guidelines will mean fewer vaccinations

“These actions follow recent federal changes made to increase confusion and undermine proven public health protective measures,” the department said in a written statement Friday.
In recent months, federal health agencies operating under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have limited recommendations on who should receive certain vaccinations – going against the guidance of many medical societies.
Public health advocates say the administration has contributed to a climate of confusion around vaccinations, and report that patients are not sure who to trust.
The Northeast Public Health Collaborative hopes to counter that confusion by developing vaccine recommendations and other public health guidelines. But it’s not clear yet if the collaborative’s messaging will cut through the noise or add to it.
Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, thinks Maryland’s participation in the group is an imperfect step in the right direction.
“We think it’s a good idea,” he said. “Vaccines should be based on science. Is it a perfect solution? No, but it’s a step in the right direction.”
Matthew Celentano, executive director of the League of Life & Health Insurers of Maryland said it’s “too early to tell” if the collaborative’s effort will be effective in countering the Trump administration’s messaging.  But he agrees the effort is worth pursuing.
“They (the collaborative) want to replicate the public health work that’s been done for generations in the United States — and not bend to the will of political posturing that seems to be happening in the public health world right now,” he said. “If that leads to improved Marylanders’ health — that’s worth engaging in.”
In addition to joining the collaborative, the Maryland Department of Health has also released 2025-26 guidance for the flu, RSV and COVID-19.
Those recommendations largely reflect guidance from major medical societies such as the  American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
CDC panel opts against requiring prescription for COVID shot, wants greater emphasis on risks

Maryland’s COVID-19 recommendations also reflect guidance issued by the Northeast Public Health Collaborative last week as well. The group has not released guidance on RSV or the flu.
Essentially, Maryland’s recommendations suggest that most everyone get vaccinated for COVID-19 and the flu. The COVID-19 vaccine recommendation is “especially important” for those 65 years old or older and those who are at increased risk of severe infection.
Meanwhile, the RSV vaccine is recommended for those aged 75 and older or those aged 50 and older who are at an increased risk of severe disease.
Before the state joined the collaborative, Gov. Wes Moore (D) assured Marylanders that access to vaccinations would be protected in the state for the time being. In May, he signed legislation that required insurers to cover vaccinations that had been recommended by federal health officials as of December 2024, avoiding any change to coverage based on recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). That law took effect June 1.
“The Maryland Department of Health is focused on using evidence-based science to make decisions that best serve the people of our state,” state Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said in a written statement. “Research continues to show that vaccines are an effective way to keep our communities healthy. We encourage everyone to talk with a health care provider who can help assess your personal health care needs and determine if a vaccine is right for you.”

It's unclear what Democrat Mikie Sherrill would do. (Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)As Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill vie to become New Jersey’s next governor, Ciattarelli has used countless public appearances to tout how he’ll shift state policy on immigration, while Sherrill has been largely quiet about her own plans.
Ciattarelli has said if he is elected governor in November, he’ll move on “day one” to rescind the state order that provides sanctuary to undocumented immigrants, the Immigrant Trust Directive. The order from the state attorney general, which dates to 2018, restricts when state and local law enforcement can assist federal immigrant agents and from asking someone’s citizenship status if it’s not related to an investigation.
“Executive order No. 1 is ‘no sanctuary cities,’ and we will not be a sanctuary state,” he said at an event in Elizabeth on Thursday.
Sherrill, a congresswoman since 2019, has previously praised the directive without explicitly saying whether she’d seek to continue it if she’s elected. Asked during a Sunday gubernatorial debate whether the directive would remain in place if she is elected governor, she declined to answer.
“What I’m going to do is make sure we’re following the law and the Constitution, so that’ll include due process rights and the Constitution,” she said.
New Jersey has become a key battleground in the nation’s political war over immigration. The Trump administration worked with private prison firm Geo Group to open a migrant jail in Newark, Delaney Hall, earlier this year, the first immigrant detention center to open in President Trump’s second term and the largest one on the East Coast. The Trump administration is also eyeing Fort Dix as a potential home for migrant detainees.
The Trump administration has sued four New Jersey cities and their mayors over their local sanctuary policies, while acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is reportedly investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin, both Democrats, over the Immigrant Trust Directive. Murphy is leaving office in January after two terms.
A Quinnipiac University poll from last week said immigration is a top issue for likely Republican voters, second only to taxes, while the issue ranked less important for Democrats. In a November 2024 poll of New Jersey voters, the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University found that independents and especially Republicans named immigration as their second most important issue, while for Democrats, many other issues ranked higher.
Ashley Koning, the director of the Eagleton-Rutgers poll, said it’s not a surprise Sherrill has highlighted other topics on the campaign trail, like affordability and rising utility bills.
“These candidates are defining who they are, who they are not, and talking about those affordability issues in a way they think will best resonate that will best resonate with voters,” she said. “I don’t think we’ve seen a lot on immigration, and time will tell if we see this issue come to light and get a spotlight.”
Nearly 1 in 4 New Jerseyans are immigrants, and the state is home to more than 400,000 undocumented immigrants.
Sherrill’s public comments on the Immigrant Trust Directive have shifted in recent months.
During the campaign preceding June’s primary, when Sherrill faced five other Democrats also seeking the state’s top spot, she called the Immigrant Trust Directive “a plan that’s working.” Earlier this year, she characterized the directive  Politico New Jersey as “important protections.”
Her support of the directive was muddier when she spoke at a New Jersey Policemen’s Benevolent Association event, where an officer asked what she’d do about illegal immigration and whether she’d allow New Jersey cops to assist federal immigration officers. She responded as she did at Sunday’s debate — saying, “I’m going to follow the law and the Constitution” — comments that were met with some groans from the officers in attendance.
“I am a federal prosecutor. I’m the only one in this race who’s actually deported people for breaking the law,” she responded. “And I get that, that’s what I do. That’s what many of us want to see.”
She added: “We don’t want lawbreakers here. But at the same time, we also need our officers to follow the law, and that’s what I’ll require. Following the law and the Constitution.”
Her comments have frustrated immigrant advocates like Amy Torres, the executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. Torres said after eight years of Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, championing rights for immigrants, she’s concerned the state is “certainly not going to see more protections for immigrants” under either Ciattarelli or Sherrill.
“It’s not that there aren’t people who understand and realize the importance of this issue. It’s just that, unfortunately, of the two people that are running for governor, one understands it’s an issue, the other seems to think it doesn’t exist at all,” she said.
Torres noted that even though Ciattarelli lands on a different side of the fight than she does, she knows where he stands, unlike with Sherrill.
Torres criticized the comments the congresswoman made at the PBA event and said she wants to see Sherrill forcefully stand up for immigrants.
“I don’t want to hear the words ‘diversity’ or ‘belonging’ or ‘community.’ I want to hear, ‘This is a state of immigrants and we will defend them, which we’ve been doing for the last eight years,’” Torres said. “It’s impossible to tell where she is.”
Sherrill’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-22 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"New CT laws taking effect Oct. 1: E-bikes, towing, Sunday hunting",Gabby DeBenedictis,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/22/new-ct-laws-oct-1-2025/,Over seven dozen Connecticut laws concerning a range of issues will wholly or partially take effect. Here's a look at some of them.,"Over seven dozen Connecticut laws concerning a range of issues, from regulations around e-bikes and helmets to hunting on Sundays, will wholly or partially take effect on Oct. 1. 
Connecticut laws are passed by the General Assembly during the legislative session each year — this year’s ran from Jan. 8 to June 4 — or in a special session. They typically take effect on Jan. 1, July 1 or Oct. 1.
Here’s a look at some of the laws that will be implemented next month.
Towing laws overhaul
An overhaul of Connecticut’s century-old towing statutes takes several steps to make it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow.
State law allows tow companies to begin the process of selling a towed vehicle with a value of $1,500 or less after 15 days, among the shortest windows in the country. The new law still allows towing companies to start the sales process after 15 days, but they will now have to take more steps to give the owner a chance to claim the vehicle and the actual sale couldn’t go through until 30 days after the tow.
It also requires towing companies to accept credit cards and doesn’t allow them to tow vehicles immediately just because of an expired parking permit or registration. Vehicles can’t be towed from private property without notice unless they’re blocking traffic or fire hydrants or are parked in a handicapped accessible spot.
The bill was passed following an investigation by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that showed how state towing laws have come to favor tow companies at the expense of vehicle owners. 
A Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles working group is poised to examine portions of the state’s towing law that range far beyond its original mandate, potentially leading to more extensive reforms.
Sunday hunting
As of Oct. 1, Connecticut will permit hunting on Sundays — with some limitations.
The new law allows Sunday hunting, but limits it to private property and prohibits any hunting within 40 yards of a blue-blazed or federally designated hiking trail. The bill also prohibits the hunting of migratory birds on Sundays.
Hunters fought unsuccessfully for decades to overturn the state’s ban on Sunday hunting, which they have described as the last of Connecticut’s historic “blue laws.” In 2015, lawmakers partially repealed the ban for bow hunters.
Helmets
A new law raises the age under which motorcycle drivers and passengers are required to wear a helmet from 18 to 21, with a minimum $90 fine for infractions.
That law also requires that children under age 18 wear a helmet while riding vehicles like bicycles, scooters and skateboards. Previously, only children under age 16 were required to wear a helmet.
E-bikes
Another new law classifies some e-bikes, which previously lacked regulation around licensing and registration, as motor-driven cycles or motor-driven vehicles.
The law classifies e-bikes without pedals and with batteries over 750 watts as motor-driven cycles, which require a driver’s license to operate but are not required to be registered with the state.
E-bikes with batteries over 3,500 watts will be classified as motor-driven vehicles. It’s essentially the same classification as motorcycles and requires that vehicles be registered and insured.
Additionally, since e-bikes can be easily modified to reach speeds upwards of 60 miles per hour, the new law generally requires people who change an e-bike’s speed capability to label the vehicle with the appropriate modification.
Handcuffs on children
Police officers will now largely be prohibited from putting handcuffs on children under age 14, except in cases where handcuffing is necessary for public safety or the child is using or threatening physical force against an officer.
Existing law states that restraints like handcuffs be removed from a child before and during a court appearance. That law was unchanged.
First-cousin marriages
Connecticut law will now prohibit first cousins from knowingly marrying each other. Children born to first cousins are at an increased risk of genetic disorders and birth defects.
Existing Connecticut law, which remains in place, prohibits a person from marrying their parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, parent’s sibling, stepparent or stepchild.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_064-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

(Photo by Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder)ATLANTA — The top vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Friday to change long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed.
If approved by CDC leaders, the recommendations will also place a new emphasis on the risks of COVID-19 immunizations, despite the agency’s own data demonstrating that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people.
The panel, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a wide range of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. Several states —including Georgia, where the CDC is headquartered — have codified the committee’s recommendations into law, allowing the panel to play a key role in determining which vaccines are covered by insurance companies and how accessible immunizations are for the general public.
Though the panel did not withdraw an existing CDC recommendation that individuals between the ages of six months and 64 years get vaccinated, it does require “an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination is most favorable for individuals who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and lowest for individuals who are not at increased risk.” For adults ages 65 and older, vaccine recommendations will be “based on individual decision-making.”
COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Americans is currently much lower than that of other immunizations, such as the flu shot. Only 13% of U.S. children were up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines as of April, according to Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, who serves as the acting chief medical officer for CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Among adults ages 65 and older, that number hovers around 43%.
The CDC’s own data showed that COVID-19 vaccines reduced serious disease and emergency department visits among both children and adults. But during Friday’s meeting, some ACIP officials questioned — without evidence — whether COVID-19 vaccines provide any advantage to the people who choose to get them.
“What is the true efficacy and true benefits that these vaccines provide?” said Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Robert Malone, an ACIP member and biochemist who has previously said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise,” also pushed back on data showing that COVD-19 vaccines provide protection for the general public.
“There is no established correlative protection for COVID, period, full stop, and stop saying otherwise,” he said in a tense exchange with a fellow committee member.
Other public health officials criticized the proposed rule change that would have required patients to obtain a prescription before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
“If we start asking for prescriptions for vaccines, which are again, a primary prevention public health strategy, we are going to overwhelm physicians’ offices,” said Dr. Amy Middleman, who serves as a liaison member on behalf of the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. “It’s alarming to me that for a primary preventive strategy, we are actually adding access concerns and barriers, rather than diminishing them.”
The committee also signaled that it would be open to revising current CDC recommendations that advise all pregnant Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Current guidelines state that mRNA vaccines are safe and effective for those who are pregnant, and can help provide immunity to babies under 6 months of age, who are too young to get vaccinated.
But Levi, who delivered a presentation that centered on the risks of COVID-19 vaccines, argued that current guidelines do not fully underscore the risk of adverse effects from vaccines.
“We decided not to bring it to a vote today, but we do hope that the FDA and the CDC will look much more carefully into this,” he said. “Most of us are extremely concerned about the safety and the lack of robust evidence for not only pregnant women, but their babies.”

Mikie Sherrill (D) met at Rider University on Sept. 21, 2025, for the first of two scheduled debates between the two gubernatorial hopefuls. (Photos by Dana DiFilippo and Amanda Brown)Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Rep. Mikie Sherill (D) met on Sunday night for the first gubernatorial debate of the general election campaign, a 90-minute session that occasionally veered into testy but never devolved into an outright slugfest.
The event was a town hall-style debate, with questions from three moderators — including our own Sophie Nieto-Muñoz — and from audience members gathered at Rider University in Lawrenceville. Here are my takeaways, in no particular order:
 Joke of the night

Usually, candidates in a debate try to land jokes, but on Sunday, the debate’s host, Laura Jones with On New Jersey, easily had the best barb of the night when she said David Wildstein was not responsible for the bumper-to-bumper traffic headed onto the Rider campus before the event. Wildstein, editor of debate sponsor New Jersey Globe, was an architect of the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane closures that caused days of traffic jams in Fort Lee and led to state and federal investigations (Jones noted that Wildstein gave his OK for the joke).
 Did you know that Sherrill was a U.S. Navy helicopter pilot?

Sherrill had the microphone for all of nine seconds before she noted that she was once a Navy helicopter pilot, in case you missed that bit of biographical info from her campaign ads and her campaign logo and her million tweets about it.
 Political violence

In addition to being the day of this year’s first one-on-one gubernatorial debate, Sunday also saw the funeral for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose Sept. 10 killing sparked widespread condemnation and renewed calls to investigate and punish political violence. Asked whether they’d sign onto new GOP-led state legislation to label political violence a hate crime, Sherrill declined to answer, while Ciattarelli said he would and noted Sherrill’s evasive response.
Ciattarelli also used the moment to attack Sherrill for voting in favor of a House resolution honoring Kirk on Friday and later posting a message to social media condemning Kirk as racist.
“I think that was wrong,” Ciattarelli said.
“That’s a neat trick to say you don’t want to divide people, and then in your answer, bring up something that’s very divisive,” Sherrill responded.
 Jersey roots

Ciattarelli likes to remind voters that he’s a Jersey native and Sherrill is not (she’s from Virginia). He made a pointed reference to this on Sunday in a dramatic moment that saw him stare directly at her while he tied incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy’s support of offshore wind energy to the Democratic governor’s status as a Jersey transplant.
“Now if he was from New Jersey, and anybody who was from New Jersey would know, that the Jersey Shore is sacrosanct here in this state. Nobody wants wind farms off our Jersey Shore, male, female, young and old, Republican, liberal, conservative, liberal, for different reasons,” he said.
 Taxes

Wildstein asked both candidates a yes or no question: Would you commit to not raising the state’s 6.625% sales tax as governor?
Ciattarelli answered, “We are not raising the sales tax here in New Jersey.”
Sherrill (eventually) answered, “I’m not going to commit to anything right now, because I’m not just going to tell you what you want to hear.”
Her answer was notable because Sherrill spent a lot of the debate hammering Ciattarelli over some votes he made in support of raising taxes as an elected official. Her campaign has also circulated a misleading audio clip of Ciattarelli to claim he’d support raising the state’s sales tax to 10% and slapping it on food and clothing.
 Unanswered questions

Despite valiant efforts by the debate’s moderators and members of the audience to ask basic questions, the candidates skillfully avoided answering them when they didn’t feel like it, though it felt like Sherrill did this more than Ciattarelli.
The most obvious example came when the candidates were asked whether they would continue the Immigrant Trust Directive, an order from our attorney general that restricts when state and local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.
Sherrill answered by saying she would not allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to walk around masked and accused Ciattarelli of supporting policies that allow people in the United States legally to be detained. When pressed about whether she would continue the directive, Sherrill again declined to answer.
“What I’m going to do is make sure we’re following the law and the Constitution, so that’ll include due process rights and the Constitution,” she said.
Ciattarelli, who liked to remind the audience when Sherrill evaded a question, said, “I don’t think she answered your question. Executive Order No. 1 on day one, we’re getting rid of the Immigrant Trust Directive.”
 Segregated schools

The Sherrill campaign and her allies are making a lot of Ciattarelli’s answer to a question about segregated schools, one they claim reveals something far more sinister than I think it does.
The question was, would you as governor continue to fight a lawsuit filed by a group of parents and activists who allege the state’s school districts are unconstitutionally segregated and what do you think the state can do to achieve less segregated schools?
Neither of them initially answered the first part. Ciattarelli said he would focus on improving schools with “high-impact curriculum.” Sherrill said county-based school systems would help, as would high-intensity tutoring and phonics-based reading lessons in third grade. I’m not convinced these answers include a legitimate solution, though county-based schools might help if a Gov. Sherrill could get buy-in from towns (a gigantic if).
It was the initial part of Ciattarelli’s answer that won quick condemnation from Democrats.
“We do have the most segregated schools, but I wonder if we would be having this discussion if the performance of schools with predominantly Black student populations were outperforming schools with predominantly white populations. We need to get back on day one to improving all of our schools, and I intend to do that with a high-impact curriculum,” Ciattarelli said.
When I heard that, I heard him arguing that the problem is not segregation but terrible schools in districts that serve Black students. But a Democratic super PAC posted a clip of his comments — sans the bit about improving curriculum — and said, “Jack Ciattarelli defends racial segregation in schools,” a sentiment that appeared to be shared by some of Sherrill’s allies. Sen. Andy Kim (D) called the comments “shameful,” while Sherrill said Ciattarelli “doesn’t care about” segregated schools.
 Boos

No one asked about the issue of trans students in sports, but that didn’t stop Ciattarelli from shoehorning the issue in.
Ciattarelli, who has told voters on the campaign trail that he would ax a state policy that allows school officials to keep students’ gender identity changes from their parents, interjected his thoughts on this when answering a question about vaccines.
Sherrill said she’s worried that declining vaccination rates will lead to the spread of serious illnesses. Ciattarelli said he also finds the rise in measles and mumps cases concerning.
“The obligation of any governor on day one after they take their oath of office is the public health and safety, and we’ll do that under Governor Ciattarelli,” he said, then added, “I just wish my opponent showed the same concern when it came to biological males participating in female sports. We should be protecting all students.”
To my ears, the comment elicited the loudest set of boos of the night.
If the idea was to bait Sherrill into a response, it did not work. In her response, she attacked Ciattarelli for not criticizing Trump health appointees.
The two candidates will meet for one more debate in about two weeks.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ciattarelli-sherrill-2-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

(Via Karla Hernández-Mats)Educated We Stand, a national education organization founded to combat the influence of the conservative Moms for Liberty, have announced a new chair dedicated to tackling what she believes to be a “fascist playbook.”
That’s Karla Hernández-Mats, ex-president of the country’s third-largest teachers’ union and a former Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. The organization was founded in 2024 to promote the importance of public education, school board races, and taking on “far-right extremists” in the education sphere, their website says.
“I truly believe in public schools being the cornerstone of democracy,” Hernández-Mats told the Florida Phoenix in a telephone interview. “But we are seeing so many MAGA extremists attacking its foundation.”
Hernández-Mats, who takes over on Monday, condemned Republican officials for “spreading fear” by banning certain books in schools and “censoring” teachers and professors who have criticized conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on social media following his assassination. Although she denounced any speech inciting violence, noting that “senseless” attacks are dangerous to democracy, she stressed that expressing harmless opinions is a First Amendment right.
“I think if we just study history and we make sure that we’re not censoring history, that we are teaching it with authenticity, we will see that fascism has a playbook,” Hernández-Mats, 45, continued. “It’s occurred in many countries, and they attack education and they ban books, and they censor — this is part of the fascist playbook.”
Her comments came as dozens of public school teachers and university professors nationwide have been suspended or fired for either celebrating Kirk’s death two weeks ago or denouncing the conservative views he had held. 
It also follows a broader conservative education push from Gov. Ron DeSantis, who paved the way for the nationwide crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in higher education; pushed for legislation banning school books deemed inappropriate; and waded into school board races during his second term in office, overhauling the former non-partisan races into political affairs.
This gave rise to Moms for Liberty, a conservative parental rights organization that’s supported DeSantis’s agenda at nearly every turn. Founded in 2021, DeSantis has appointed two of its three co-founders to state commissions. He appointed another member to the State Board of Education. 
‘Front line fighting for democracy’
Hernández-Mats is a first-generation American of Honduran descent who credits her father, a farmer and carpenter, with teaching her the importance of getting an education.
“Education is the key to success, and that’s how you break cycles of poverty,” she said. 
The new chair has been highly involved in both the education and politics throughout her career, including teaching special education at a South Florida middle school, becoming Teacher of the Year in 2010, and serving as the President of United Teachers of Dade for nine years — the largest teachers’ union in the Southeast and the third-largest nationwide.
In 2022, she ran alongside former Gov. Charlie Crist as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor.
Hernández-Mats hopes that Educated We Stand can expand into more states, highlight the importance of city and county school boards by endorsing candidates aligned with public school values, and quash right-wing advances into education.
“We need to make sure that people understand how school boards, which are often overlooked, are really the most important right now because they are on the front line fighting for democracy and for our children’s future,” she said.
She will take over the post from Jennifer Jenkins, founder of Educated We Stand and a Democratic candidate hoping to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody. 
Jenkins, who upset Moms for Liberty co-founder Tina Descovich in a 2020 Brevard County school board race, started Educated We Stand in 2024 specifically to combat that organization, whose growing conservative influence had stretched to 25 states and resulted in a roughly 40% win rate in school board races during 2022 and 2023. 
Educated We Stand has since raised over $375,000 in the past six months and has lauded its 78% win rate across endorsed races nationwide, boasting 27 school board incumbents on its website who won their races with Educated We Stand’s endorsement. During Florida’s 2024 election, 10 of 17 backed candidates won outright on election night. 
“We’re going to continue to raise flags and raise awareness so that we can be that stop gap in these moments where we’re seeing so much anti-public education rhetoric, and we’re seeing an attack on teachers, an attack on public schools,” Hernández-Mats said.
“We are about sharing dialogue. We are about sharing ideas and thoughts and opinions, and making sure that people are safe and are learning from that process.”

(Photo by Grant Stringer/States Newsroom)The torturously slow pace and increasingly expensive price to replace the Interstate 5 bridge across the Columbia River have some Oregon and Washington lawmakers growing uneasy and frustrated.
After years of planning and lining up billions of dollars in state and federal funding, it continues to be an educated guess when construction will start, how much the project will cost and what the new bridge will look like when traffic finally drives over it. 
Project planners had estimated the price tag for replacing the bridge would range from $5 billion to $7.5 billion, with a likely figure of around $6 billion. But legislators said last week that they now expect the total could reach $10 billion as costs have escalated 30% on transportation projects in the Seattle and Portland regions in recent years.
None of this sits well with members of a bi-state and bipartisan committee tasked with keeping tabs on the megaproject’s progress. Meeting last Monday for the first time in 10 months, several didn’t hide their pique as they pressed the administrator of the Interstate Bridge Replacement Program for answers.
One Washington lawmaker is even suggesting that the project may need to be ended or dramatically narrowed, and has contacted the Trump administration to suggest pulling back previously awarded federal funding. 
In the meantime, the existing bridge is in danger of collapse in a major earthquake, and one of its spans is over a century old. Supporters of the project predict fewer crashes, faster commutes and more transit options when the new bridge is done.
A final environmental review for the project was supposed to conclude this year, Oregon state Sen. Khanh Phạm, D-Portland, told the committee. Completion is now expected in 2026. 
“I’m just concerned because this is driving up costs for Oregon and Washington taxpayers, and when we miss our deadlines, it really does have an impact on our transportation budget as we try to find the funding to make up for the increased costs,” she said.
Program administrator Greg Johnson acknowledged the timeline slipped, noting the environmental analysis must be finished before required federal permits can be obtained. He estimated it could be the middle of next year before initial work begins.
“There are complex issues we are dealing with. We cannot skip steps,” Johnson said.
If required approvals are in hand in 2026, as planners anticipate, cars could begin driving across a new bridge in 2032 or 2033.
Ever-changing price tag
Project planners now say that an updated cost estimate for the project should be completed before the year’s end, as staff examine “100 risk factors,” including inflation and tariffs.
Oregon lawmakers are in special session and expected to pass a major transportation package to raise $4.3 billion over the next 10 years for maintenance and operations of the state’s roads by the end of the month, pending one Democratic senator leaving the hospital. Nothing in the legislation is dedicated to covering increased costs for the interstate bridge.
In Washington, the Legislature enacted a six-year, $3.2 billion package for its transportation system earlier this year. It also contained no money for any escalation of the bridge’s costs.
At this point, financing is coming from several sources. Each state has committed about $1 billion. Tolls — which will be imposed in both directions on the existing bridge starting in 2027 and managed by Washington — are relied on for a minimum of $1.2 billion. Oregon has a moratorium on any tolls other than the bridge.
Federal grants totaling $2.1 billion were awarded last year under the Biden administration. Planners are pursuing $1 billion from the Federal Transit Administration’s Capital Investment Program. This would help pay for a 1.9-mile extension of light-rail from North Portland to a future station near Evergreen Boulevard in Vancouver, Washington. A decision on that funding isn’t expected until the project is further along.
Joe Cortright, the chair of the Oregon Governor’s Council of Economic Advisers, testified in opposition to the project during last week’s meeting. He said federal funding isn’t guaranteed as the Trump administration cracks down on federal grants. 
“It’s reckless to embark on this project before you know whether you’re going to get some or any of the billion dollars you’re counting on from the federal government,” he said. 
Washington state Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, in an interview afterwards, preached patience.
“I’m not thrilled,” he said of the slowdowns and unresolved issues. “This is a big, complicated project. There are going to be complicating factors. It’s the way these things go.”
Responding to concerns the Trump administration or the U.S. Coast Guard could make decisions that reduce federal support and add costs, Liias said, “We’re in the figure-it-out stage.”
Resources will be there to replace the bridge, Liias said, even if it means other pieces of the sprawling project are delayed. There are nearly 30 separate items — from new bus shelters to off-ramp improvements — in this endeavor.
Fans, foes and the future
Because the height of the bridge could affect ship traffic on the Columbia River, the U.S. Coast Guard is one of the federal agencies with sway over permitting. And the bridge’s final design may hinge on the Coast Guard’s input about accommodating vessels.
There are two main configurations under consideration for the replacement bridge. One design is for a single-level bridge with fixed spans, and the other is a single-level bridge with a movable span, similar to what exists today.
If the new span is a drawbridge, the vertical clearance will be 178 feet, as it is today. But the other potential design of a fixed span would have only 116 feet of vertical clearance. That would prevent vessels with clearance requirements greater than 116 feet from traveling under the bridge, absent some kind of mitigation.
Johnson, the program administrator, said a movable span would add roughly $400 million in costs.
Khanh Tran, an advocate for Oregon businesses owned by people of color, told the committee that replacing the bridge would benefit communities that have historically been left out of projects at this scale.
“A new bridge strengthens Oregon’s ties with Washington, supports interstate commerce and ensures we remain as a region a competitive global economy,” he said. 
But Washington state Rep. John Ley, R-Vancouver, an ardent opponent for years, said the lack of answers supplied as of last week solidified his stance that the project needs to be sharply scaled back — or even ended.
He said he reached out to U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to encourage him to scrutinize the project and consider clawing back the $2.1 billion in federal grant dollars — almost all of which has yet to be sent to the states. 
That could force leaders of the two states to reset expectations. Oregon and Washington could go it alone, he said, but it would mean ditching light rail and other bells and whistles.
“I think this is so far gone that the only way to stop this eight to 10 billion dollar boondoogle is to kill it,” Ley said.
Liias, the Washington senator, remains optimistic about the bridge replacement. “We are going to get to the finish line,” he said. “Leadership in both states are committed to getting it done.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/i5-bridge-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)It felt like a combination of a fast-casual restaurant, a health store and a mall pop-up shop, except at this retailer, you can buy what you need to get high.
Customers packed into the Brooklyn Park location of RISE dispensaries on its first day of adult-use cannabis sales on Sept. 17, one of the first non-tribal pot shops to open about two years after the Legislature fully legalized cannabis in 2023.
“I’ve been waiting for them to make it recreational ever since they opened,” said Elijshae Washington, a 29-year-old, stay-at-home mom who lives nearby. “It took way too long.”
Around 40 people stood in the adult-use line, which led to a long counter manned by nine staff members. The medical marijuana line had at most one or two customers at a time.
As those who have been to recreational dispensaries in other states can attest, the experience is about as far from buying weed from a guy in a gas station parking lot as you can get. It even stands in contrast to how THC gummies are sold at a gas station store, which is to say, just like how regular candy gummies are sold at a gas station store.
At a dispensary, however, “there’s more of the process of making sure it’s safe and everything. You kind of take a risk with it on the street, a little bit,” Washington said.
Prices, which ranged from $40 to $50 for an eighth of an ounce, are “a little high, but you don’t have to wait for anybody,” said Heather Hiivala, 54. “You can just come and get it, you know?”

The scene at RISE last week was just one of many all over Minnesota, where cannabis aficionados over 21 lined up at the first non-tribal recreational marijuana dispensaries. Though the state’s stoners have, for years, been able to legally grow weed, possess marijuana and buy THC edibles at thousands of breweries, gas stations and head shops, it was the first time non-tribal retailers could sell the real, green stuff — THC flower — at a dispensary to adults without medical cards.
The wait since the drug was legalized — edibles and drinks in 2022 and for real in 2023 — has been long. So far, two dispensary franchises have started selling recreational weed — Green Goods and RISE, which both previously sold only medical cannabis products. They join a handful of tribal dispensaries, such as NativeCare in Red Lake, which got a head start in selling non-medical cannabis thanks to compacts between Minnesota and tribal nations.
RISE delivered a streamlined experience complete with self-service kiosks and staff walking around with QR discount codes, dressed in purple tie-dyed shirts that read “Best Buds Forever.”
Customers perused one of several curated brand displays featuring empty product packaging — the drugs were kept behind counters — and merch on mannequins, including a dog hoodie on a dog mannequin. The store was oddly odorless.
It was a true 21st-century commercialized experience that almost makes you forget the real possibility of addiction and the risk of various side effects like respiratory problems (when smoking), lower neurocognitive functioning, especially for young users, and even psychosis.

Jesus Muñez, 24, usually buys THC edibles at a smoke shop in Blaine. Muñez said he feels more at ease with the process in the dispensary, which includes an ID check and sign-in upon entrance.
“I like that they’re able to show you the percentage of THC in it, too,” Muñez said. “A lot of places you go, it’s like: this is what we have, take it or leave it.”
Customers also said they were curious about the quality of the products.
“I’m kind of trying to see what this is like to see how good the flower is or not good it is, but we’ll see,” said Ray Lawrence, 41, who grows his own weed.
Lawrence expressed some pessimism on how the government will handle the nascent legal marijuana industry.
“I’m just waiting for them to screw this up,” he said, anticipating a rise in taxes.
As of a new law that took effect in July, Minnesota’s cannabis tax is 15%. After adding the state’s sales tax, the total tax rate for cannabis is around 22%, and higher in many metro cities. That’s the fourth highest in the nation, according to the Star Tribune. The hefty levy has some industry watchers concerned that if taxes and prices are too high, people will opt for the black market, which would partially defeat the purpose of legalization. 
On quality and taxes, the jury’s still out. (Feel free to write the Reformer a review of dispensary weed: AChen@minnesotareformer.com.)",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_1245-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

(Getty Images)Childhood obesity in Indiana is rising, and the latest data show a challenge that is both urgent and complex.
According to the report “Weight Trends Among Children and Adolescents within Central Indiana,” more than one in five Hoosier children between the ages of 2 and 19 were living with obesity, and nearly 4 out of every 10 children in the region were overweight or obese. The share of overweight and obese children rose steadily over the last decade, with much of the rise occurring during the pandemic years. While the data for this report focus on central Indiana, these findings mirror trends found across the state.
Of particular concern is that the highest increase in obesity prevalence was found in our youngest children. Obesity prevalence among children ages 2 to 5 grew by 83% from 2014 to 2023, with most of that increase occurring during the pandemic. Boys in this age group saw the sharpest rise. Racial and ethnic disparities are also clear, with Hispanic and African American youth experiencing the highest increases, highlighting broader social and economic factors tied to health.
The impact of obesity extends well beyond the weight itself. Children living with obesity face greater risks of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and orthopedic problems, along with psychosocial challenges such as low self-esteem, anxiety, and social isolation. These concerns ripple into schools and communities, affecting attendance, focus, and participation in activities. Without intervention, childhood obesity often persists into adulthood, compounding the risks for lifelong chronic illnesses.
The economic stakes are also high. Children living with obesity face an estimated additional $19,000 in lifetime medical costs compared with their healthy-weight peers. These expenses burden families and the health care system, while the human cost in lost health, confidence, and opportunity, is even greater.
It is important to recognize that obesity is not simply the result of personal choices. Research confirms that it is shaped by multiple factors: genetics, access to nutritious food, neighborhood safety, sleep quality, and opportunities for physical activity. Food deserts, limited access to recreational spaces, and economic pressures often overwhelm families’ best intentions.
Tackling the issue requires a broad, community-wide approach, and it must be done without shaming or blaming children or families. Every child deserves support, encouragement, and access to the resources that foster health.
What works
Evidence points to several strategies that can help reverse these trends:

Start early: Healthy patterns begin before birth. A mother’s diet and activity during pregnancy influence a child’s future weight and metabolism. For infants, feeding and sleep routines matter. Soothing without food and promoting adequate rest reduces risk.
Family-based approaches: Studies show that when parents and children make lifestyle changes together, results are more sustainable. Eating meals as a family, being active together, and modeling healthy behaviors support healthier outcomes. Family-based programs have helped children and parents maintain weight loss for up to a decade while also improving mental health.
Nutrition and access: Offering fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while reducing processed snacks and sugary drinks has long-term benefits. Schools and youth-serving organizations can provide healthy meals, educate youth about food choices, and ensure that healthier options are the most affordable and accessible.
Physical activity: Children and adolescents need at least 60 minutes of movement each day, yet only 23% of Indiana high school students meet this standard. Expanding safe spaces for recreation, partnering with parks and community centers, and weaving short movement breaks into classrooms and after-school programs can help.
Sleep and screen time: Insufficient sleep is linked to higher obesity risk even in infancy. Encouraging consistent bedtimes and reducing screen use improves both weight outcomes and mental health.

Working together
Reversing the childhood obesity trend in Indiana will require coordinated action among families, schools, health care providers, policymakers, and community organizations. Parents can model healthy choices, share family meals, and limit screen time. Schools can facilitate and promote daily activity and ensure that food served in cafeterias supports health. Youth workers can integrate play, healthy snacks, and positive conversations about wellness into programs. Health care providers can screen for obesity early and connect families to resources. Policymakers can address systemic barriers ranging from improving nutritious food access to investing in safe recreational spaces, to helping children access preventive and other health care services.
Indiana Youth Institute is proud to partner with Jump IN for Healthy Kids on the latest data brief that makes this growing problem clear. While these trends are troubling, solutions exist and are within reach for Hoosier children when we work together.
Childhood obesity is a statewide issue, but it is also a statewide opportunity. Indiana can create an environment where every child has access to nutritious food, safe spaces to play, and supportive adults who reinforce healthy habits. By working together and rejecting shame and blame, we can give every child the foundation for a healthier, brighter future.

Mike Braun, then the governor-elect, assembles the majority of his cabinet in December 2024 at the Indiana Statehouse. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun’s decision to give two of his top officials additional leadership posts has revived a longstanding constitutional question in Indiana: when can one person legally hold two government offices at once?
Last month, Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner was confirmed as the state’s next higher education commissioner, while also keeping her K-12 role. 
Just weeks later, following the abrupt resignation of Jennifer-Ruth Green, Indiana State Police Superintendent Anthony Scott was tapped by Braun to take on a second job serving as the secretary of public safety. 
Green stepped down amid an ongoing ethics investigation by the state inspector general into alleged ghost employment and misuse of state property. It’s now up to the State Ethics Commission to decide whether she violated state law — and what sanctions, if any, to impose.
Jenner’s salary will remain the same $275,000, according to the state’s online transparency portal. Scott’s compensation is expected to rise from $184,842 to about $275,000 — the same pay as other cabinet secretaries — Braun’s office confirmed.
Administration officials say the appointments reflect Braun’s broader push to make state government leaner and more effective.
“Gov. Braun campaigned on streamlining government and making it work better for Hoosiers,” said Griffin Reid, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. “Combining these roles is a common sense move that will save taxpayer dollars and improve service.”
What Indiana’s Constitution says
Indiana governors have occasionally consolidated power by stacking responsibilities on top officials — a practice sometimes referred to as “dual hatting.” 
Braun’s predecessor, Gov. Eric Holcomb, named then-Public Safety Secretary Rob Carter to also lead the Department of Correction in 2017.
And under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, some cabinet secretaries simultaneously headed state agencies such as the Department of Workforce Development and the Office of Management and Budget.

The Indiana Constitution prohibits most public officials from holding more than one “lucrative office” — meaning a public post created by law that carries a salary or other fixed compensation — at the same time. 
Article 2, Section 9 states that “no person may hold more than one lucrative office at the same time, except as expressly permitted in this Constitution.”
But that provision — in place since Indiana’s 1851 Constitution — leaves gray areas. 
Not every government job qualifies as a “lucrative office.” 
Some positions are created in statute with sovereign powers and a set salary, making them clearly covered. Others are more administrative, created by the governor without legislative definition, making them less likely to trigger the constitutional ban.
A “Dual Office Holding Guide” published by Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office lays out a four-step analysis to evaluate whether someone can legally hold two public positions at once.

Are both positions “lucrative offices” under Article 2, Section 9? If yes, the dual role is unconstitutional and must end. If not, move to step two.
Would holding both violate separation of powers? Indiana’s Constitution bars one person from exercising powers of different government branches simultaneously.
Are the positions incompatible or do they create a conflict of interest? Dual service is improper if one job is subordinate to the other or the responsibilities clash.
Is the combination prohibited by other law? State or federal statutes — including the federal Hatch Act — can separately bar some officeholders from taking another role.The guide cautions, however, that even if a dual role passes all four tests, it still may pose “public policy concern[s]” or risks of conflict that should be carefully considered.

Although the education secretary and the higher education commissioner are paid positions, which would normally raise red flags under step one, Jenner is continuing with one salary rather than drawing two paychecks. As such, the governor’s office held that the arrangement does not amount to holding two lucrative offices. 
Steps two and three also pose little conflict for Jenner, given that both of her roles fall squarely within the executive branch and share the same policy goal of overseeing Indiana’s education system. Additionally, no other state or federal law blocks the overlap, clearing step four.
For Scott, the position of ISP superintendent is created by statute and is clearly lucrative, while the secretary of public safety is a cabinet designation crafted by the governor. That makes it more akin to an advisory role than a separate office. 
Like Jenner’s case, Scott’s appointment passes the separation of powers test, and the governor’s team contends there is no inherent conflict since both positions share the same public safety mission. Scott, too, will be paid one salary, not two.
The governor’s rationale
Braun’s office has maintained that Jenner and Scott’s new assignments comply with this framework. Administration officials confirmed both appointments were reviewed under the four-step analysis.
Jenner, who now oversees both K-12 and higher education policy, additionally defended the combination as an opportunity for alignment across sectors. 
“Presently, in Indiana, about 60% of our budget is devoted to education,” she said shortly after her commissioner role was confirmed last month. “The opportunity we have in Indiana is to ensure we’re getting the best return on investment for those dollars,” she told reporters. “What is really working? What is moving the needle? Let’s invest more in that.”

Dan Peterson, chair of the Indiana Commission for Higher Education board, praised the move, too. 
“When you’re a great leader, you get more and more responsibility,” he told reporters. “This move, which helps bring the education vertical as close together as possible, makes a ton of sense.”
Scott, in a Sept. 9 message to state police staff, called his appointment “an opportunity [that] goes far beyond me as an individual and would not have been possible without ISP’s well-established commitment to professionalism, excellence of service and public trust.” He emphasized that greater collaboration across Indiana’s “public safety vertical” would benefit from the standards of the state police.
Still, Scott asked for patience as he learns to balance both jobs: 
“As your Superintendent, my commitment to you and to the Department will never waiver,” he wrote. “I do ask for your patience as I continue to navigate the responsibilities of this new position.”

At the League, we know kids and their families come first when making budget and policy decisions, and the Michigan they inherit will depend entirely on the investments we make today in their schools and neighborhoods as well as in workers and our economy. 
While the pandemic era saw incredible investment from 2020 to 2024 to help kids, families, and young adults cope with the disruptions, state and federal policy in 2025 has reversed course in a big way. The federal megabill signed into law in July saw the largest cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on record, programs that 43% and 23% of kids in Michigan rely on, respectively, to access health care and nutritious food. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The new Kids Count in Michigan data shows declines in infant mortality and teen births, high rates of health insurance coverage and improvements in access to prenatal care and lead testing, but these bright spots in the health domain may prove tenuous as the bill’s worst cuts take effect. The bill will devastate state funding with nearly $2.2 billion in Medicaid cuts alone while ripping away health care from over a million Michiganders in the coming decade. 
In addition, the bill cuts SNAP by over 20% over the next 10 years, taking away vital food assistance even as food costs and childhood food insecurity continue to rise. An estimated 74,000 Michigan adults — including 35,000 with children ages 14 to 18 — are at risk of losing food assistance because of new work reporting requirements. 
Federal budget cuts are not the only risk to a vibrant future for children in Michigan. The continued failure to pass a state budget threatens to deepen these harms.
Lawmakers in Lansing have neglected to pass a state budget on time, held up by an ongoing conflict on how to fund road repairs. But the solution to Michigan’s long-decaying roads cannot come at the expense of kids. The impasse continues to delay a state budget even as students across the state have returned to schools that remain in the dark about their funding future. 
While Michigan sees improvements in childhood health, education outcomes raise concerns

And now is not the time to ignore the needs of Michigan students. Education is the Kids Count domain that continues to see the worst outcomes, with third-grade reading and eighth-grade math scores down and fewer students graduating college-ready. In addition, the new data shows an all-time high number of students eligible for special education services, but the state continues to employ an inequitable funding formula that reimburses schools just 28.6% of special education costs. 
If we envision a future where families want to raise their children in Michigan, we need to be investing in a truly pro-kid policy agenda. This includes meeting families’ care needs, such as funding the true cost of early care and education as well as enacting paid family and medical leave for all workers.
A pro-kid agenda will also prioritize children’s health by offering continuous Medicaid coverage for young children, improving access to mental health services in public schools and increasing state spending on tobacco prevention and cessation. It will prioritize education by fully funding the Opportunity Index for schools with high levels of concentrated poverty and adopting universal free community college to help the state reach its Sixty by 30 goal.
A pro-kid agenda will also include young adults, who face the highest poverty rate of any age group but are currently left out of the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit. It will reexamine life without parole for emerging adults as research shows they are still in a phase of heavy brain development.
Finally, a pro-kid agenda will provide economic security for all families through the adoption of a Michigan Child Tax Credit and by improving access to the Family Independence Program, Michigan’s primary cash assistance program for families with very little or no income. 
The official deadline to pass a state budget is disappearing further into the rearview mirror with no compromise in sight, but now is not the time to forget the needs of our youngest residents.

My first political contribution was supposed to be free — Minnesota promised to give the money back. Instead, I found myself staring at a paper form, dreading months of waiting for the check. I donated but never claimed the refund. If the process discouraged me, as an eager first-time voter, it’s no wonder so few Minnesotans use it.
The Minnesota Legislature created the political contribution program in 1974, a post-Watergate reform to curb the influence of big money and amplify the voices of everyday Minnesotans in state elections. It began as a tax credit and was converted in 1991 into the Political Contribution Refund, or PCR, with added spending limits for participating candidates. 
Fifty years later — and 15 years after Citizens United unleashed billions into politics — the PCR feels outdated: overlooked, underfunded, and sustained only by modest tweaks. 
Budget shortfalls repeatedly suspended the program from 2009 to 2017, and earlier this year, Gov. Tim Walz proposed eliminating it altogether as a cost-saving measure. But the PCR has survived, thanks to rare bipartisan support. Both Democrats and Republicans have long recognized that empowering small donors is common-sense politics. Last year, lawmakers raised the refund from $50 to $75 for individuals (and from $100 to $150 for couples). In 2025, the program is moving into the digital age with direct deposits for refunds, and a pending bill aims to create an online application system.
As Minnesota just begins to modernize PCR, 14 states and more than two dozen cities now offer some form of public campaign financing — ranging from Maine’s Clean Election Act, which lets campaigns run entirely on public dollars, to New York’s small-donor match that multiplies grassroots contributions, to Seattle’s Democracy Voucher Program, which gives every resident four $25 coupons to direct to candidates. 
Across the country, public financing has energized grassroots campaigns and opened politics to new voices. 
In New York, Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral campaign was powered by the city’s 8:1 match, multiplying small-dollar contributions that propelled his long-shot victory in the Democratic primary. 
In Seattle, democracy vouchers have drawn thousands of first-time donors, particularly younger, lower-income, and racially diverse residents — and just last month, voters overwhelmingly chose to renew the program. 
In comparison, Minnesota’s PCR has fallen short. Participation has plummeted: the share of eligible contributions refunded dropped from 58% in 2007 to just 13% in 2021; and in 2022, fewer than 1 in 100 Minnesotans claimed it. Even for those who know about the program, the hassle of upfront costs and paperwork keeps many on the sidelines — something online filing alone won’t fix.
In 2022, the Coalition for Integrity ranked Minnesota 13th in its State Campaign Finance Index. For a state that prides itself on clean and accessible elections, it’s a reminder of the room for progress, and the influence big money continues to hold on our state politics. 
From 2000 to 2022, independent expenditures in Minnesota rose from $3.7 million to over $63 million; in many races, and particularly the most important races, outside spending now outpaces candidate fundraising. 
At a time when Americans are more disillusioned by politics than ever, Minnesota can invest in reforms that level the playing field and restore confidence in our elections. 
The good news is this won’t require breaking the bank. The PCR costs under $2 million a year — a rounding error in Minnesota’s $66 billion budget. Seattle funds its Democracy Voucher Program at about $3 million annually, or just $8 per homeowner. For a modest investment, cities and states have delivered outsized returns: higher civic engagement and campaigns powered by people rather than wealthy networks.
Minnesota can follow Seattle’s lead, introducing a new model for public campaign financing. Instead of clinging to the rebate model, lawmakers should flip it: an up-front voucher system where voters direct coupons straight to campaigns. Minneapolis DFL Rep. Emma Greenman’s “Democracy Dollar” proposal pointed the way, though it stalled in committee in 2023. The bill didn’t pass, but it lays a roadmap for what’s possible. 
And lawmakers can go even further. That could mean pairing vouchers with a small-donor match to reward candidates with broad community support, or extending public financing beyond state races to city elections in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where outside money often drowns out the voices of residents. The goal is to evolve PCR into a broader system that makes participation easier and puts small donors at the center of every election. 
Minnesota once set the standard for fair elections. We can do so again — by reimagining the PCR to put power back where it belongs: in the hands of everyday Minnesotans. With the right reforms, we will open the door to new voices, reduce candidates’ dependence on corporate money and big donors, and help restore trust in our democracy.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/campaign-money.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

By that time, signatures are due for the group seeking to force a referendum on the new congressional district map, intended to hand Republicans the 5th Congressional District. Missourians will also be voting at some point next year on new majority requirements for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative, and by that time the political alignments and funding for the upcoming campaign will be clear.
Finally, before the end of the year at least some of the court challenges being heard in Cole and Jackson counties will likely be through the trial courts and in the hands of appeals court judges.
Judge hears arguments in case seeking to toss Missouri’s new congressional maps

Richard von Glahn, a veteran of four initiative campaigns on minimum wage, is leading the effort to put the new congressional map on the ballot. If the campaign committee People NOT Politicians collects about 110,000 signatures by Dec. 11, the law revising the state’s eight congressional districts will not take effect until there is a statewide vote.
“In less than a week since this map was passed, we’ve had over 2,200 Missourians sign up to volunteer to gather signatures,” von Glahn said. “I’ve obviously been through this a couple times, but I’ve never seen the sort of groundswell we’re seeing now.”
The final verdict on the Legislature’s work will come next year, when voters would see the referendum, if successful, on a statewide ballot. The election would be held in November 2026 unless the General Assembly sets an earlier date.
That is also when voters will act on the measure targeting initiative petitions and perhaps a second proposal on initiatives, proposed by petition, to counter the one passed by lawmakers.
During the 10-day special session, Republican leaders changed the rules and shut down debate in the state Senate to pass the legislation. Now they must face the people, von Glahn said.
“It’s so clearly politicians not focusing on what Missourians want and need, but simply on what politicians want,” he said. “I think you’re going to see a huge outpouring of anger.”
Along with volunteer sign-ups, People NOT Politicians has raised $805,000 for the petition effort, including a $500,000 check from Global Impact Social Welfare Fund, a 501c4 nonprofit that is not required to disclose its donors.
“I feel very confident, and we’re going to turn in the signatures needed by December 11,” he said.

 Initiatives campaign

The measure passed by lawmakers to change majorities for initiative proposals will appear on a ballot as Amendment 4. It will go before voters in November 2026 unless Gov. Mike Kehoe sets an earlier election date.
There are two campaign committees ready to oppose it, one supporting it and another trying to get an alternative on the ballot.
It would change the way majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition. Instead of just a statewide majority, initiative proposals would need both a statewide majority and a majority within each of the state’s eight congressional districts.
As few as 5% of voters could defeat initiative petitions under Missouri GOP legislation

That would allow as few as 5.3% of voters to control the outcome. Recent election results show that Missouri would not have legal marijuana, Medicaid coverage for working-age adults, sports betting or legal abortions if the proposed new standard were already in place.
The most powerful group, financially, working to defeat Amendment 4 is the Missouri Realtors, who in their internal blogging set themselves apart as a separate political party. They are building a campaign under the name Missourians for Fair Governance.
The Realtors have used the initiative process twice, in 2010 to prohibit sales tax on real estate transfers and again in 2016 to prohibit sales tax on services.
The initiative process safeguards industry and empowers voters to protect their rights, a recent post stated. 
“Efforts to weaken it or limit it are bad policy,” the post read. “They threaten the balance between lawmakers and the people they serve, while limiting Missourians’ ability to directly shape laws and constitutional protections.”
There are 25,000 Realtors in Missouri and fundraising by the organization’s PAC shows their financial strength. In the second quarter, the PAC raised $395,000, with donations from 648 realtors or affiliated employees.
Sam Licklider, lobbyist for the Realtors, told legislators in his testimony that the entire network would be activated to work against the initiative changes.
“We have somewhere in the neighborhood of $8,317,000, so we are well-positioned to ensure our arguments reach the public,” Licklider said.
The other opposition committee, in formation, is the Will of the People Coalition. Denise Lieberman, director of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, said it will bring together all the groups opposed to Amendment 4.
“The fate of Missouri democracy is on the ballot next year,” Lieberman said.
The committee supporting passage of Amendment 4 is Protect MO Voters, led by Andy Bakker, executive director of Liberty Alliance USA, one of many not-for-profit political organizations backed by the foundation established by the late St. Joseph business owner Stan Herzog.
The proposal on the ballot also bans foreign contributions to Missouri ballot campaigns, something prohibited in a law that took effect Aug. 28, and tightens rules for collecting signatures.
“We look forward to working with a broad coalition of Missourians who want to protect our initiative petition process from signature fraud and safeguard our constitution from foreign adversaries seeking to undermine it,” Bakker said in an email to The Independent.
The name chosen for Bakker’s committee is almost identical to the social media handle and hashtag identifier for Lieberman’s group. She said she expects a lot of traffic to her sites because of the similarity and welcomes the chance to get the opposition message out.
“So if you look up Protect Mo Voters, you’re going to get to the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, which is working to protect the citizens in this process,” she said.
Bakker, however, said the committee is just adopting the name for the amendment included in the legislation.
“Any confusion is being caused by liberals who oppose these common-sense reforms,” Bakker said.
The measure that will be Amendment 4 goes further in giving a small portion of the state a veto over the whole than proposals in previous years. A measure debated up to the final days of the 2024 session would have required a majority in five of the eight districts.
James Harris, a long-time Republican consultant and lobbyist, backed the 2024 proposal and this year’s measure for clients FGA Action and State Shield. He said the argument that will work best is one highlighting portions of initiative proposals that were not well known at the time of passage.
“Citizens will likely support this ballot measure because it will make common sense to them,” Harris said. “I have sat through focus groups, and when you tell them a little more about what they voted on, they are irritated by what they learn.”
The initiative proposal that would counter the legislative amendment is being circulated by a committee called Respect MO Voters. Instead of making it harder to pass an initiative, it would make it harder for lawmakers to change one after it passes.
Missouri Republicans shut down Senate debate to pass abortion ban, repeal sick leave law

Last year, voters approved an initiative that increased the minimum wage and required employers to provide paid sick leave. Republicans in the state Senate shut off debate to pass a bill repealing the paid sick leave and a provision adjusting the minimum wage for inflation that had been law since 2006.
Under the Respect MO Voters proposal, passage of a bill changing anything in a successful initiative would require support from 80% of lawmakers in both chambers and be subject to another statewide vote.
The Republican plan to increase the majority requirement found no support at the 25 town halls the campaign has conducted, campaign director Benjamin Singer said.
“What we kept hearing from people across the political spectrum at these town halls and listening sessions was that they wanted it to be as difficult as possible for politicians to repeal or change what the people decided,” Singer said.
The campaign is operating on a small budget, raising only about $280,000 so far. It is relying heavily on volunteers to circulate petitions, Singer said.
The similarity of names in the coming campaign may confuse voters, von Glahn said, but the issues should not.
“It doesn’t actually matter what political party you come from, Missouri voters like having power themselves. They want things that encourage accountability back to our needs and desires,” he said. “I’m not worried about people being confused by the different things, because a lot of it is actually from the same framework of a power grab by politicians.”

Proposition A, approved by nearly 58% of voters in November, gave workers one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked — about seven to eight days a year for a full-time employee. The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the law in April, rejecting a lawsuit from business groups that claimed it was unconstitutional and too costly. 
By repealing Proposition A, the Missouri legislature overrode both the will of Missouri voters and the state’s highest court.
At a time when communities are still recovering from the lessons of COVID-19 and other infectious outbreaks, repealing paid sick leave is dangerous. 
During the pandemic, I worked as an ICU nurse. We were eventually told we could come to work COVID positive if we had no symptoms, as long as we stayed masked. That decision kept hospitals staffed in a pandemic, but it spread risk to patients and workers. 
What we learned was simple: when sick workers can’t stay home, everyone is at risk.
Missouri has already seen the consequences when staff cannot stay home sick. By late October 2020, 1,241 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in the state’s nursing homes and long-term care facilities — nearly 46% of all COVID deaths at the time. State reports pointed to staff working across facilities, weak infection control, and policies that allowed asymptomatic employees to remain on the job. With residents already at high risk, outbreaks spread quickly and proved devastating.
Missouri voters expanded paid sick leave. The GOP undid it, and the repeal just took effect

Paid sick leave helps stop outbreaks before they spread. The CDC has found that it reduces infection in the everyday community spaces Missourians rely on — schools, daycares, restaurants and nursing homes. When that protection is taken away, families who depend on these places are more vulnerable.
For many Missouri households, two incomes are essential to make ends meet. Nationally, nearly two-thirds of mothers are primary, sole or co-breadwinners, according to the Center for American Progress. Without paid sick leave, parents risk lost wages or even their jobs if they stay home with a sick child. In rural areas, limited providers and long travel times make the strain even greater. 
Voters across party lines supported paid sick leave in Missouri. A 2022 Navigator survey found that more than 70% of Republican and independent voters supported paid family and medical leave. According to the National Partnership for Women & Families, more than a dozen states already guarantee paid sick leave, making it a standard workplace protection Missouri briefly adopted.
Missouri faces growing disparities in access to health care. 
Without paid sick leave, workers delay care and arrive sicker. Studies show that access to paid sick days increases use of primary care and reduces avoidable ER visits.
Rural Missouri is home to nearly one-third of the state’s population, and nearly a quarter of residents rely on Medicaid, compared to just 15 percent in urban areas. These pressures fall hardest on the state’s 35 Critical Access Hospitals, many chronically understaffed and underfunded. 
According to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, From 2014 to 2023, 19 hospitals closed across Missouri, including 12 in rural counties. Those closures left 50 rural counties without a hospital, forcing residents to travel long distances for treatment. The facilities that remain operate on tight budgets and short staffing, and all 19 closures occurred in federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas, underscoring how limited access to care already was in rural Missouri.
Supporters of the repeal offered two main objections. 
The first was practical: small businesses argued that even modest sick leave mandates increased payroll costs and complicated scheduling, a challenge felt most acutely by restaurants and nursing homes with shallow hiring pools. 
The second was philosophical: opponents insisted that the government should never mandate benefits, regardless of their effectiveness. 
Small business concerns deserve attention, but the long-term costs of high turnover, preventable outbreaks, and lost community trust outweigh short-term adjustments. Evidence from Connecticut, New York and California shows no negative effect on overall employment. 
Employers absorbed modest costs, often offset by reduced illness and higher retention. The business community itself was divided: Gina Meyer, owner of J E Meyer Construction Co. in Jackson County chose to keep offering sick leave voluntarily, while trade groups pressed for repeal. That split shows compliance was possible, yet organized opposition pushed ahead anyway, discarding evidence and experience to roll back a vital protection.
Health economists and Missouri health policy leaders warn that rural hospitals are already operating on razor-thin margins. Any spike in uncompensated care could tip them into collapse. 
Sheldon Weisgrau, vice president of health policy at the Missouri Foundation for Health, says many of the state’s 67 rural hospitals “operate on the financial edge” and are at risk of closure if coverage decreases. Without paid sick leave, more patients delay care or rely on emergency services, which adds costs to hospitals least able to absorb them.
Paid sick leave could have been phased in gradually or paired with targeted support for the smallest employers. Instead, lawmakers chose a full repeal, stripping away a safeguard against public health risks.
If the pandemic taught us anything, it is that sick workers forced onto the job do not just endanger themselves. We all pay when staff work sick. Hospitals absorb the costs, families absorb the risks, and outbreaks become a community-wide concern. 
Repealing Proposition A will not save jobs. It trades short-term payroll savings for higher infection risk, higher turnover costs and preventable harm in Missouri.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051525_workersrally10-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-22 06:58:21.388585

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
ICE arrests in Wisconsin from January to the end of July this year increased 22% compared to the same time period last year and most of that increase has come from federal authorities arresting people who have been charged with but not yet convicted of a crime, according to federal data compiled by the Deportation Data Project. 
Advocacy groups say the increase in arrests has sown fear and confusion among the state’s immigrant communities, and the intensity of ICE’s tactics have drawn attention and controversy across the country. But Wisconsin has thus far avoided the full brunt of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown compared to the state’s four midwestern neighbors. 
Iowa, which of the five states had the lowest number of ICE arrests last year under President Joe Biden, has seen arrests increase 293% this year under Trump. 
Illinois, where Chicago has become a focus of federal law enforcement and ICE activity, has seen ICE arrests increase 46% this year. 
Minnesota, despite its similarities to Wisconsin in  total population and number of Hispanic residents, has seen ICE arrests increase 95% this year. 
Last year, Michigan and Wisconsin had nearly equal amounts of ICE arrests. But under Trump, Michigan ICE arrests increased 152%. 

Luis Velasquez, statewide organizing director for Voces de la Frontera, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the administration’s tactics have caused fear to spread through immigrant communities across the state — even if the total number of arrests hasn’t increased as much as in other places. And while the numbers haven’t increased substantially, local law enforcement across the state has shown an increased willingness to devote resources to the federal immigration crackdown. The number of county sheriff’s offices participating in a federal collaboration program with ICE has jumped from nine to 14 this year. 
“In many ways it is like a psychological warfare that this administration has launched,” Velasquez said. 
Tim Muth, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Wisconsin, said the data can’t be used to predict future ICE activity in the state, but in the first eight months of the Trump administration, ICE is working with local law enforcement in ways that have terrified immigrants. 
“We don’t want to speculate on individual statistics or on what the future plans of the Trump regime may be, but we can say that increased collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE is instilling a sense of fear and instability in Wisconsin’s immigrant communities,” Muth said in an email. “We know they are ramping up their deportation agenda, and they are relying on local authorities to make it happen.”
Trump was elected after running on a platform of “mass deportations” and taking advantage of a backlash against a spike in the number of people making claims for asylum at the U.S./Mexico border under President Joe Biden. But Velasquez said it feels like ICE’s increased role is doing nothing to address the real challenges of immigration policy.
“There isn’t this thoughtful, strategic conversation, to really solve these issues,” he said. “It has been very radical, the way that it’s been enforced. So on the ground people have lost that kind of sense of let’s talk about solutions. It feels very reactive. People are not shopping, with school started again, there’s fear about ICE going into schools. It’s charged with anxiety and fear. It’s unnecessary suffering that is being caused statewide.” 
He points to instances in which people living in the country without legal authorization  have been arrested after showing up for court dates or been accused of bizarre crimes by the federal government. 
“What people are sensing in one way is this is a system that doesn’t make sense. It’s not working for us,” he said. “And then, on the other hand there’s people who are saying, ‘Well, I can be accused of any crime, and then I could just be detained.’”
The Trump administration and Department of Homeland Security officials have regularly claimed ICE is targeting “the worst of the worst,” rooting out violent criminals and gang members. But NBC5, a Chicago TV station, reported this week it could find no criminal record for people the department arrested on immigration charges, claiming they were violent offenders. 
Across the Midwest the increase in ICE arrests has been driven by targeting people who have been charged but not  convicted of crimes — a tactic that experts say violates due process and makes communities less safe. 
In Wisconsin, under Biden, 56% of those arrested by ICE were convicted of a crime and 9% had pending criminal charges. This year under Trump, 60% of those arrested have been convicted of a crime and 24% have pending criminal charges.

That data includes cases such as Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the Mexican immigrant who had appeared for a court date in Milwaukee County in a misdemeanor battery case when federal agents from ICE, the FBI and DEA arrived at the courthouse to arrest him. That arrest led to federal authorities charging Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan with a felony for allegedly obstructing the arrest. 
Nationally, 70.8% of people in ICE custody have no criminal convictions, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. 
“ICE will continue to prioritize the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have committed violent crimes, ensuring our children are protected and justice is served,” the agency, which did not respond to a request for comment, said in a news release on Wednesday about its arrests of six individuals without legal documentation convicted of sex crimes in six different states. 
While the administration emphasizes justice when it says it is targeting dangerous criminals, Muth said arrests of people not yet convicted damages the criminal justice system. 
“Picking up persons on ICE detainers while charges are still pending subverts the criminal justice system and deprives persons of their right to trial,” he said. “We also remain deeply concerned about the ongoing erosion of due process, as immigrants across the country have been abruptly rounded up by masked agents, detained and arrested without explanation, all while their families are kept in the dark about what’s happening to them. These horrifying scenes point to the federal government’s willingness to ignore the rights of immigrants and betray fundamental principles of our immigration system.”
Luca Fagundes, a Green Bay-area immigration attorney, says ICE operating in courthouses is the “easy road” for rounding up immigrants because people have little choice to avoid a court date — even if the crime is as simple as driving without a license, which immigrants without legal authorization to live in the country are unable to obtain in Wisconsin. 
“People are showing up to traffic court, and when their case is called their identity is confirmed, which makes it very easy for an ICE officer to detain them after leaving the courtroom,” Fagundes said in an email. “That person, who showed up for court (again, for perhaps something as simple as driving without a license) is now being arrested and detained by ICE. They will then be transferred to an ICE facility where they wait weeks or months for a bond hearing with an immigration judge. While in ICE custody waiting to see the immigration judge, they typically then miss the next court appearance they may have on their traffic court matter, and that results in a warrant for their arrest on that simple traffic matter.”
“It’s a domino effect of catastrophe for that individual,” she added, “and, if applicable, their family.” 
Velasquez said the modest increase in arrests here in Wisconsin has triggered fear. But he said successful organizing efforts to protect migrant farm workers and prevent more law enforcement from signing agreements with ICE may have helped stave off raids on farms and, for now, helped keep Wisconsin’s immigrant workforce safer than workers in other states. 
“There’s people who are being detained, so people are feeling it, regardless of the data,” he said. “But I do agree [about] the power of local communities being able to reject and say that we know  what’s best for our local communities. We’re not going to be seduced by money, by this administration. … We know our local communities better, and we don’t want our workers to suffer.”
“I think that there are powerful alliances that are being built across Wisconsin,” he continued. “That may be the reason why we haven’t gotten hit. But who knows — that could dramatically change tomorrow, right? So we do recognize the small victories, and this is good news, right? But at the same time, I think we need more dialogue. We need more common sense policies. We need more conversations of what we agree on.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)More of Indiana’s state agencies are earning approval for their mandatory expense-shrinking strategies — albeit with varying levels of enthusiasm.
Some have warned the effective 10% cuts could jeopardize statutorily required work, while others concluded their filings with cheery mantras.
“We realize that it is not about equal giving but equal sacrifice across our great state government agencies because we are ‘#INThisTogether,'” Department of Revenue leaders wrote. “We appreciate the partnership with the State Budget Agency and understand the monumental task that has been thrust upon you to provide the necessary guidance that will ultimately help stabilize our state government’s finances.”
A grim May revenue forecast prompted lawmakers to cut most agency appropriations by 5% in the latest budget — and authorized the State Budget Agency to withhold another 5%.
Agencies were required to describe how they’ll meet that target in “strategic spending reduction plans” due at the end of June. Gradually, they’re nabbing the go-ahead, and their filings are being uploaded.
Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute President Stephanie Wells celebrated the reports’ public availability.

“More transparency is always better — more data and more information on the decisions of Hoosier government is our preference,” Wells said, though she noted that “some are a little bit more informative than others.”
There’s a long way to go, however. Indiana is less than three months into its two-year budget; the fiscal year began July 1.
“I hope that they continue to report on the impact the holdback has made to the delivery of government services over the course of the biennium,” Wells said.

Many agencies with labor-intensive responsibilities noted almost all their budgets are spent on employees — leaving little room to slash expenses without reducing headcount.
The Office of Inspector General, for instance, reported that salaries and benefits account for 92% of operational costs. The office advises and investigates alleged wrongdoing to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in Indiana’s executive branch agencies.
“Despite efforts to minimize the impact, these budget cuts will inevitably affect the OIG’s ability to fully serve its core mission,” leaders wrote. 
OIG successfully requested an exemption from the 5% reserve standard.
Others are taking the hit.
Analysis: Latest Indiana budget drops spending 7% — with cuts ‘telling’

The State Personnel Department — the government’s human resources arm — and the Office of Administrative Law Proceedings also expend 92% of operational dollars on staff.
They planned to meet the reserve requirement with stringent, near-identically worded “position management strateg(ies).”
“Newly vacant positions will undergo formal review by (agency) leadership to determine if the position is critical or non-critical to operations,” their spending plans read. “Where appropriate, we will attempt to collapse the responsibilities and functions of vacant positions into existing positions, programs, or teams” before seeking to fill the roles.
Critical jobs can be filled — but first, must be vacant for at least 30 calendar days before posting.
“This will ensure at least 60-90+ days of cost savings,” the plans read.
Non-critical positions will be “deactivated” or kept vacant. If empty roles are still considered non-critical after 90 days, they’ll also be deactivated.
It’s unclear if all agencies are subject to this policy.
“Agencies weren’t directed to include a position management strategy in spending plans specifically. However, they were asked to address staffing with the expectation that requests for compensation or classification reviews would be factored into spending plans,” an SBA spokesperson said. “SPD is focused on helping agencies with strategic workforce management.”
The Department of Workforce Development is also downsizing.
It was dealt a whopping 27% cut in the budget, according to a Fiscal Policy Institute analysis, before the additional 5% reserve requirement. It also had a “sudden and unforeseen” federal funding drop.

Leaders, in their plan, explained that DWD’s funding and workload run “countercyclical” to the economy.
“In times of economic downturn, federal funding increases significantly; in times of economic growth, federal funding tapers off,” they wrote. “However, the associated workload of economic downturns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, often last(s) well beyond” the extra money’s end.
The agency’s workforce peaked in 2022 at about 1,300 employees but has since dropped. “Further reductions” are coming.
Leaders estimated a staff of less than 900 in 2025, but are “targeting pre-pandemic staffing-level costs.” Headcount hit a low of about 800 in 2020.
“That’s sort of indicative of how much — not all — of government works: you have to hire individuals to do the work,” Wells said. “… Personnel is, I wouldn’t say, the easiest place to cut, but it’s the most logical place to cut.”
The role reductions and vacancy policies are “very reminiscent of what was done during the Great Recession at a state level,” she said. She worked for former Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration during that time period.
“What I’ll be interested to see is when that stops — when we get back to the baseline, and then we slowly start to bring folks back into government and replace open positions in a more standard way,” Wells continued. “And that may not be this biennium. We’ll just have to see.”
Uniquely enough, the Public Access Counselor’s Office is betting on past underspending to “cut” costs. The office provides guidance on state public records and open meeting laws.
Indiana public access office goes quiet amid turnover

Former Counselor Luke Britt said his longtime deputy and administrative assistant left partway through 2024. He resigned in February this year. Gov. Mike Braun appointed new Counselor Jennifer Ruby in March.
“This office should not have fully used its payroll allocation,” Ruby wrote, but will need to spend to address its backlog.
Other savings strategies include having the Office of Administrative Law Proceedings pay for a part-time, temporary legal intern, and a part-time paralegal through next June.
Still, she asked for a waiver from the 5% reserve in order to pay for a senior attorney — who would “still be paid below average.”
Meeting that requirement would force the salary to an entry-level amount, Ruby explained. “This … would leave our office with no deputy PAC to support the operations to meet our requirements under Indiana law.”
Other entities primarily make grants. In its plan, the Commission for Higher Education celebrated that administrative costs are just 2% of spending in fiscal year 2026 — “well below the 4-5% industry standard.”
Contractor considerations
Agencies were required to take a hard look at their contract expenses in their spending plans. Some brought contracted tasks in-house.
The Department of Revenue, for instance, will take over paper check scanning for the Department of Child Services when its current vendor agreement expires in November, saving between $200,000 and $300,000 annually. 
DOR also plans to seek legislation “dramatically” reducing mailing requirements, like limiting the number of attempts to resend returned mail, and by letting Hoosiers opt into e-notices. The agency hopes to cut $1.75 million from its annual $3.5 million in mail expenses.
But there’s still plenty of uncertainty.
“A potential risk to our plan” is the legislator-authorized tax amnesty program, which is to be conducted before the end of next year. DOR asked for an exemption from the 5% reserve to fund that. “An additional risk” is that the agency may absorb all administrative functions for the Child Support Bureau.
Meanwhile, data-centric Management Performance Hub doesn’t have enough money to cover Informatica functions past March.

“We will be discussing ownership with (the Indiana Office of Technology), and agency stakeholders to determine the best way forward,” leaders wrote.
MPH also requested to hold $350,000 from the amount reverted to the General Fund at the end of last fiscal year. The agency is rushing to migrate its databases from one vendor to another before the end of the year to avoid pricey consequences. The move is expected to cost $400,000 to $600,000.
Missing that deadline would cost MPH an additional $490,000 to $610,000 in annual renewals. But to finish it all in time, the agency might need to lean on the vendors or other contractors — to the tune of between $200,000 and $250,000.
The State Board of Accounts was also hard-hit. The auditing entity’s workload increased 30% during the pandemic, and that won’t let up until the end of 2027, according to the spending plan.
That’s because the influx of federal spending came with new federal audit requirements and push many local governments past a federal spending threshold that triggered more audits.
“Reduced funding will directly lead to a reduction in the number of examinations that the SBOA can complete,” agency leaders warned.

To deal with the work, SBOA contracted private examiners. But to complete all statutorily required audits without contractors, the agency would need about 30 more field examiners. 
The spending plan listed challenges: a “significant reduction” in college accounting majors, the lowest number of Certified Public Accountant candidates in over a decade and experienced accountants leaving the field.
 SBOA also reported struggling to stay competitive with private sector starting salaries — and dealing with the “targeted recruitment of our most experienced auditors by private firms and other governmental units.”
The agency has no layoffs planned. It’ll keep hunting for new additions instead, and any reductions in staff will be based on attrition.
Exemption efforts
Requests for exemptions from the 5% reserve or other fiscal requirements were commonplace among the spending plans approved thus far.
For Wells, that’s to be expected.
“Of course, you’re going to ask for exemptions, as an agency director, where you can,” she said, “so that your operations can continue to function at a high manner.
“You might shoot your shot, as it will, and see what you can get.”
The Indiana Department of Health successfully requested an exemption to fund the licensing and surveying of healthcare facilities, according to the spending plan. That includes 173 hospitals, 157 ambulatory surgery centers, 225 residential care facilities, 246 home health agencies, 97 hospice agencies, 43 blood centers, seven birthing centers, and approximately 3,000 personal care services agencies.
The agency also makes recommendations on certifications for about 510 nursing homes, 6,900 laboratories, 161 end stage renal disease facilities, 46 outpatient rehabilitation facilities, 151 rural health clinics, and much more.
IDOH leaders said the agency wouldn’t be able to complete high-importance surveys quickly enough for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — “which could lead to them cutting agency funding to even lower levels.”
Not every waiver request is granted.
IDOH asked for an exemption from the Statewide Cost Allocation Plan, citing cuts in the federal funding that typically makes up a lot of the agency’s budget. The agency expects to owe the state $1.5 million in fiscal year 2026 because it is two years in arrears and because personnel expenses have increased.
The Indiana State Police also submitted a spate of exemption requests — some of which were granted, some in-progress and some seemingly denied.

ISP was one of the few agencies that got more money out of lawmakers. But some of its accounts still got cut, including Forensic and Health Sciences Laboratories, the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center and Indiana Operating/Motor Carrier Inspection. Those escaped the 5% reserve requirement.
Some money for drug interdiction and DNA sample processing will be held from the agency’s planning budget.
Leaders submitted several pages of detailed expense-cutting strategies, like bringing radio repairs in-house; fueling at ISP posts “when practical,” “avoiding excessive idling” and “always using 87 octane fuel.”

“Oconomowoc is a great place,” Kevin Ellis, an alderman on the Common Council and a member of the private fundraising committee, told Wisconsin Examiner. “It’s a great city. It’s one that I’m glad that I found 21 years ago.” 
While Oconomowoc — the city’s name is derived from a Potawatomi word meaning “where the waters meet” — isn’t known for gun violence, a member of the city’s fundraising team compared the purchase of the gear to buying insurance. During an incident in July, for example, a Shorewood officer’s ballistic vest reportedly prevented serious injury by gunfire. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
By the end of its fundraiser, Oconomowoc’s police department had far exceeded its $40,000 goal, according to a column in the Oconomowoc Enterprise by council president Matt Rosek.
While the new body armor has the potential to be lifesaving, some remarks about crime and unrest made by supporters of the fundraiser weren’t supported by data, records and past reporting reviewed by the Examiner.
Oconomowoc gun crime claims lack data support
Oconomowoc city officials announced their ambitions to augment protection for officers by fundraising for rifle-rated body armor inserts and pistol-rated ballistic helmets in early June. According to a budget priorities memo in May, Police Chief James Pfister said that with the right equipment, Oconomowoc officers can confidently respond to dangerous situations involving an active assailant. Officers could quickly assist victims, perform life-saving evacuations and effectively manage threats, “ultimately saving lives and reducing risks.”   
As the fundraiser was announced, however, members of the public took to social media to question the department’s efforts on Facebook. 
“I think more people would be happy to donate to the cause if we could have some background information,” one commenter, Morgan Murphy, wrote in a June 5 post. She asked what situations call for the new gear and how frequently those situations arise.
“If it’s a common occurrence shouldn’t there already be some on hand?” Murphy posted, wondering whether concern about such situations is increasing, and if the public should be concerned. 
City officials described the present moment as a “time of continued unrest and potential for escalated violence in our community and those around us” in a letter to potential donors, which the police department provided to the Examiner in June.

“Over the last five years, communities have seen a variety of incidents of unrest,” said Lou Kowieski, fundraising team member and former council president, when asked about the letter. He said he didn’t know if this would happen again, but that he wants the police department to be prepared. 
In a separate letter posted to Facebook, Police Chief James Pfister said the department had been responding to more gun-related calls over the past three years and that this was “a stark reminder of the growing challenges our officers face in keeping our community safe.”  
Wisconsin Examiner reviewed gun call data from the department’s dispatch center for June 2022 to June 2025, which did not show a definite increase in calls involving a gun. The number of “10-32” calls — police shorthand for gun-related calls — stayed the same from June 2022 to June 2025 at just under 40 calls or less. In order to give a more complete picture, the police department also provided data on all calls in which the word “gun” was mentioned, which rose slightly from 108 calls annually in the 2022-2024 years, to 119 in 2025. It is not known whether a gun was found at the scene in any of these calls. Neither data set includes information on the types of guns referenced in the calls.
Oconomowoc PD Captain Brad Timm said Pfister’s statement referred to the chief’s personal knowledge of “major gun calls specially from Target and Roundy’s,” and Timm said the equipment would be used for those types of calls. 
A shooting at the Roundy’s distribution center in Oconomowoc left the shooter and two co-workers dead in 2021. In a separate incident, a Milwaukee man was charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide earlier this year. The man reportedly pulled a gun out of his pocket and pointed it at a co-worker and a security guard at the Target warehouse in Oconomowoc, later telling police that he pulled the trigger and his gun jammed.
Wisconsin Examiner also requested crime data from the police department for June 2020 to June 2025. As requested, the data appears to break down reported crimes into 13-month periods, from the beginning of June of each year  through June of the following year.
The department reported more aggravated assaults recently, up from two in 2022-2023 to five in 2024-2025. An aggravated assault involves either the offender using a weapon, the offender displaying a weapon in a threatening way or the victim suffering obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury. It was unclear how many of those assaults involved a firearm. The department reported seven aggravated assaults in 2020-2021. 
The most recent data reported fewer weapon law violations than in past years. The weapon law violation definition involves the offender breaking a rule relating to a deadly weapon, such as a rule about the possession, manufacture or use of the weapon. The department’s data reported no murders or non-negligent manslaughters after two incidents that occurred in June 2020-June 2021.
 
 

 
According to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, if a murder or assault involved a deadly weapon, it could also be counted as a weapon law violation. However, a murder, for example, would not be also counted as an aggravated assault. 
 
By comparison the police department for Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s most populous city, reported 132 homicide offenses in 2024 and has seen multiple gun-related officer deaths since 2018. The Milwaukee Police Department declined to provide the rating for officers’ standard body armor due to security concerns. 
Ricky Burems, who retired from the Milwaukee Police Department in 2014 with 32 years of experience, told the Examiner over text message that he used a vest that was resistant to AR-15 rounds. 
“A vest doesn’t make you impervious to gunfire,” wrote Burems, who worked as a plain-clothes drug unit officer and as a homicide detective. “It really hurts to get shot even if you’re wearing a vest. I recall a couple of officers who were killed when bullets went between the panels of their vests. But vests definitely help.” 
Oconomowoc’s Capt. Brad Timm said the rifle plate inserts the city was fundraising for are rifle rated, while the ballistic helmets are pistol rated.
In July, Timm said that most officers had a level-two bulletproof vest that protects against pistol-caliber firearms. He said at the time that when officers are hired, they are given a level-two vest, and the cost of more resistant level-three body armor would be the officer’s responsibility. Police departments in Madison and Milwaukee also allow officers to purchase more protective equipment on their own. 
Why did Oconomowoc pursue the gear this summer?
Wisconsin Examiner asked Timm what led to the fundraising push for more protective gear this summer. Timm said that “it was brought up to better equip our officers with higher rated ballistic head protection and vests, essential gear for high-risk situations.” 
In his June 5 column Rosek, the Common Council president who also recently announced he is running for mayor, said the fundraiser’s goal was to protect officers from high-power, large caliber rifles. While Oconomowoc is a safe place to live, there had been “several significant tactical situations over the last several years,” he wrote.
Rosek mentioned a bank robbery, a shooting at a Kroger’s, and a shooting incident on the overpass at Interstate 94 and Highway 67. Since Roundy’s is a subsidiary of Kroger’s, Rosek, who did not respond to the Examiner’s requests for comment, might have been referencing the 2021 shooting at the Roundy’s distribution center. Waukesha County court records show that the bank robbery incident involved suspects with pistols, which the department’s standard body armor should be rated to withstand.

In the May 6 budget memo, Pfister said that “recent events, like those at the Oconomowoc industrial facilities, sadly underscore the urgent need for advanced gear to keep our officers safe.” 
While the Target distribution center incident took place earlier this year, it appears the bank robbery, overpass shooting and Roundy’s shooting occurred prior to 2022. Lou Kowieski, a fundraising team member and former council president, told the Examiner that he didn’t think there was a correlation between the incidents mentioned by Rosek and the police department’s request for protective equipment. Kowieski said he thinks “those incidents help provide, unfortunately, the real-world scenarios of where those are needed.” 
Kowieski also referenced the July shooting that injured a Shorewood officer, and said that “in general, not just in Oconomowoc but in multiple communities, that threat level of use of firearm power is there.”
“You’re going to get insurance for tornadoes,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that you’re going to have a tornado tomorrow. But if it happens, you need to make sure you’re covered.” 
Timm was unable to give an exact number of the calls or incidents the department had responded to that involved a type of firearm their current gear wasn’t rated for, and for which the new gear would have provided sufficient protection. Asked whether or not he could say this type of situation had occurred at all in the last several years, Timm only replied “Yes.” 
Supporters cite mutual aid, 2020 unrest and protests
Rosek’s column also mentioned the potential for Oconomowoc officers to be deployed outside of Oconomowoc, without mentioning any specific city or situation.
“We also know that our police officers will respond to situations outside of our community if called upon,” Rosek wrote. “Violent situations put our officers at greater risk than we have seen before.”
Asked if Oconomowoc has sent officers to assist other communities in need of additional officers for an incident in the last several years, Timm replied “Yes.” 
Kowieski said that not too long ago, officers from Oconomowoc helped support situations in other communities, such as Wauwatosa, Racine and Kenosha “when the social unrest became a challenge for all police departments.” Kowieski said this connects to the fundraiser because it helps prepare the department to provide mutual aid when requested by other communities in various scenarios, including civil unrest or school shooters.

Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the Wauwatosa Police Department about whether OPD had assisted them since 2020. A spokesperson said that to the contrary, Wauwatosa officers assisted OPD in 2021 during an incident at Roundy’s, but that there are no records showing Oconomowoc officers assisting during situations in Wauwatosa. 
If concern about protests and unrest are causing the city to procure the equipment, John Norcross, who lives in the nearby village of Lac La Belle, thinks “we ought to have a public conversation about that.”
A community Facebook page, “Oconomowoc Supports Our First Responders,” also suggested the gear would help keep officers safe during protests and unrest, specifically mentioning civil unrest that took place in Kenosha during a summer of nationwide protests over police violence and misconduct. The post mentioned Black Lives Matter protests organized in Oconomowoc’s Fowler Park and stated that “5 years ago this summer the threads of our community fabric were at a breaking point.” 
The Fowler Park protest, however, was peaceful, as were most Black Lives Matter protests across the country, according to a 2020 University of Connecticut study.
Norcross thinks the reference to the Black Lives Matter protest feeds an unfounded fear that any kind of protest has the potential to create social unrest. 
“I was at the BLM protest in Oconomowoc,” Norcross said. “There was absolutely no fear, no fear of any social unrest from that. But I do sense that [there is] rhetoric of using Kenosha for years as a keyword for, ‘Hey, we need to be careful. We need to be armed. It could happen at any moment.’”

Mutual aid documents from the curfews in Kenosha and Wauwatosa do not list the Oconomowoc Police Department. Although records from Wauwatosa documented a single Oconomowoc police captain as being present in or around the command center, it does not appear that the department had an on-the-ground presence during Wauwatosa’s curfew. 
Two people were killed and another severely injured in Kenosha after heavily armed teenager Kyle Rittenhouse fired an AR-15 style rifle at protesters. No gun violence or deaths occurred during the curfews in Wauwatosa or Milwaukee. (Rittenhouse was acquitted of charges related to the shootings in a jury trial.)
Fundraisers ‘freed up’ tax dollars for other needs
In a column on Aug. 28, Rosek wrote that he was asked why the city hadn’t added the purchase of body armor to the 2026 budget. 
Rosek’s June column praised the police department for providing “24/7 patrolling,” a citizen’s academy, and other services. “There is no question we are a safer community because of their commitment to our citizens,” he wrote. “Our police department is completely funded by our property tax dollars and is the largest single spend we have in the annual budget.” 
Rosek wrote about previous fundraising, stating that “most of the funding for the body cameras ($150,000) and for the K-9, Gabo, ($125,000) was privately fundraised.”  
In memos from May 2025, where various parts of the Oconomowoc city government shared budget priorities, the police department included about $37,000 in body armor inserts and ballistic helmets. 
Rosek’s column, published a month later, said that the department is funded by a tax levy which comes with restrictions. Sometimes, this means “certain initiatives need some help to get over the finish line,” he wrote.

But when Wisconsin Examiner asked Oconomowoc police captain Brad Timm in July if he believed the city would still buy the equipment if it could not fundraise in the community, he said yes. Community fundraising is the quickest way to obtain the equipment, Timm said, and without a fundraiser the equipment would have been requested in the 2026 budget. 
The police department didn’t respond to some of the Examiner’s questions, including whether donors were informed that the city could afford to purchase the body armor inserts and ballistic helmets through the budget, and that private fundraising was chosen because it was quicker. 
Jerry Wille of the Oconomowoc Lions Club, which donated $10,000 to the fundraiser, said that “budgets are very difficult in today’s world. So we don’t really worry about that. We know if there’s a need, as a Lion we’re there to help.”
Timm said he believed the city would have made the body camera purchase without the donations from the community, but was unsure about the K-9. He said that the body camera and K-9 fundraisers freed up taxpayer money for other city budget items.
In his column on Aug. 28, Rosek wrote that the city could have funded the protective gear, the body cameras and the K-9 officer through the budget, but that fundraising for one-off purchases “frees up more tax dollars to commit to other critical needs.” 
Part of a trend
Oconomowoc’s use of donations when purchasing protective gear for law enforcement is not unique. In 2018, the Green Bay Press Gazette reported that 50 law enforcement officers in Oconto County had gear providing protection from long guns, using donations from businesses, organizations and individuals. 
Purchases for protective gear were also made by the Milwaukee Police Department and Dodge County Sheriff deputies. The Milwaukee Police Foundation, which has operated since 2019, has also raised private funds to upgrade surveillance cameras, technology used to track phones and body cameras. 
Large donations were also made by the Green Bay Packers and PESI, Inc. toward body cameras and other equipment for the Green Bay Police Department and for Eau Claire police officers and sheriff’s deputies.
Fundraisers also help build relationships between the community and the police, said Lou Kowieski, the fundraising team member and former council president. “You can’t put a value on what the relationship between a community and a police department is,” Kowieski said. In communities without that strong bond, “You feel less safe living in those communities,” he said. “In Oconomowoc, we’re very fortunate and very blessed to have a strong sense of community that is outwardly and proudly supporting our police department and all of our first responders.”

In a statement to Wisconsin Examiner, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin highlighted issues with police fundraisers for equipment. 
“When police acquire new tools through private funding, it raises serious transparency and oversight concerns,” the ACLU stated. “Equipment purchased with private donations receives less scrutiny and examination into whether that technology is appropriate and necessary in a community. Private donations bypass public discussion and necessary public notification about why law enforcement needs the tools and how they will be used.” 
The ACLU statement added that, “with the rapid rise of new, high-tech police and surveillance technologies, it’s never been more critical for people to know how they’re being policed. However, when private donors pay for that equipment, the public is completely cut out of the process. Police should be beholden to the communities they are sworn to serve and protect, not the interests of private donors who may pledge the money with strings attached.”
With the exception of Kevin Ellis, members of the Oconomowoc Common Council did not comment for this article. 
As of Aug. 28, the fundraiser had raised $53,000, with additional funds still coming in. The team said it plans to use the extra funds to equip community resource officers. 
Rosek said the next fundraising event will be for Western Lakes Fire Department, which he said has critical needs in the next year. In 2022, seven Waukesha County communities considered a referendum that called for nearly doubling the annual budget for the Western Lakes Fire District. The referendum failed, but the city of Oconomowoc was one of the two municipalities where voters supported it.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Each year, Oklahoma leaders seem content to let June pass by without ordering our states’ flags be lowered in remembrance of one of the worst acts of racial violence in our nation’s history: the Tulsa Race Massacre.
In fact, for at least the past decade, a review of state records shows governors haven’t typically issued executive orders requiring flags be lowered to half-staff to commemorate the anniversary of the attack, including during the 100th anniversary events in 2021 that drew thousands to Tulsa.
The omission feels purposeful. Oklahoma officials lower flags frequently to memorialize the fallen of Sept. 11, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Pearl Harbor attack, the Vietnam War, Peace Officers Memorial Day and for federal holidays such as Veterans Day and Memorial Day. We, as a state, show this sign of reverence after the deaths of state and federal officials, judges, firefighters, soldiers, astronauts, law enforcement officers and even students killed in mass shootings at schools outside of Oklahoma.
But not  on June 1 each year. That’s the date of the culmination of a white mob looting and burning 35 blocks of homes and businesses in Tulsa’s affluent Black neighborhood of Greenwood from May 31 through June 1, 1921. Until then it had been a Black cultural and economic hub known as “Black Wall Street.” Records show at least three dozen residents were killed, but some estimates indicate that the number of dead could be in the hundreds. Up to 1,200 homes were destroyed.  
Apparently, June 1 is a day that many of our state leaders would rather forget.
So a pastor in Tulsa believes she should take matters into her own hands to force our state to remember those victims, too.
Francetta L. Mays, who works at Vernon AME Church in Greenwood, is running a petition to get a measure on the ballot that would designate June 1 each year as “Greenwood Remembrance and Reconciliation Day.”
And this isn’t just to remember history from a century ago. There are believed to be at least two survivors still living. Experts, including the University of Oklahoma’s Oklahoma Archaeological Survey, have been excavating a cemetery in the area to search for more victims who might have been killed to get a more accurate count of the deaths.  Some historians say that some victims were hastily buried in unmarked graves and the true death toll may be much higher.
Passing a law creating a day of remembrance seems like something lawmakers could easily do to acknowledge the event. Instead, Mays is being forced to collect over 92,000 signatures to even get the measure before voters.
It’s puzzling in a state whose lawmakers are willing to commemorate many others who were slain.
If you don’t believe me, check out what they’re already trying to do to honor Charlie Kirk, the close ally of President Donald Trump, who was assassinated while holding an event at a Utah college this month. 
Kirk hadn’t even been laid to rest in his home state of Arizona before Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, filed legislation to declare Oct. 14 as “Charlie Kirk Free Speech Day.” He also filed a bill that would require every public college and university in the state to develop a prominent area and name it the “Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza.” Additionally, he wants these institutions to erect a statue of Kirk. He’s also filed a proposal  seeking to recognize Kirk as a martyr for “truth, faith and free speech.”
The Oklahoma State Republican Party, meanwhile, wants lawmakers to create a state holiday in Kirk’s honor, with the party chair saying that “we feel like his death should be commemorated and is no different than Martin Luther King, or any other civil rights activist.” 
Let’s not forget that Oklahoma doesn’t have state holidays to honor former U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln, who were both assassinated, and also very influential in their own ways. Lincoln, after all, is credited with helping end slavery in America.
Our leaders can muster up the energy to honor Kirk, but we can’t do the same to honor the victims and survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre — people who lived here?
It doesn’t seem that complicated. In fact, it seems laudable.
But perhaps it’s easier for lawmakers to ignore this night of terror. We’re a state, after all, whose lawmakers passed a law that bars teaching topics that cause feelings of “discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress.”
This is a legacy that causes discomfort, and we’ve treated it like a dirty family secret. 
It wasn’t until the 100th anniversary of the rampage approached that I learned about it for the first time. Historians believe the incident was sparked by a 19-year-old Black man accidentally stepping on the foot of a 17-year-old white female elevator operator. Misinformation quickly spread about what happened in that elevator, and a newspaper reported that the man had attempted to sexually assault the teen. Historians say the paper also published an editorial promoting lynching.
It took decades before the massacre was first required to be taught, but in 2002 there was little guidance about how it should be taught. In 2019, education leaders fixed that to include required content in various grades. Sometimes I wonder though how those lessons can be taught without running afoul of state law.
It seems like lawmakers are A-OK with remembering one horror, Charlie Kirk’s killing, over another, the race massacre.
If that’s the case, that leaves us with a quandary. How should we choose the lives we remember and honor?

,WyoFile,2025-09-22 10:25:00+00:00,WyoFile,Wyoming could be the ‘guinea pig’ as U.S. modernizes its nuclear weapons,"by Wyoming Public Radio's Kamila Kudelska, Hanna Merzbach, Nicky Ouellet",,,,,https://wyofile.com/wyoming-could-be-the-guinea-pig-as-u-s-modernizes-its-nuclear-weapons/,"

But the updates, in the form of the new Sentinel missiles,  are running years behind schedule.
The post Wyoming could be the ‘guinea pig’ as U.S. modernizes its nuclear weapons appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. is in the process of updating hundreds of nuclear missiles, and Wyoming may be the “guinea pig.”
“There’s going to be a lot of lessons learned from this process that are, then in theory, going to be transferred down to Montana and then to North Dakota,” said Matt Korda, associate director of the Nuclear Information Project with the nonprofit Federation of American Scientists.
F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, which oversees missiles, will be the first to see changes, he said, including more communication towers and land easements. 
But the work is years behind schedule. 
Cold War-era Minuteman III missiles in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming were supposed to be replaced with new Sentinel missiles by 2029. Now that may not happen until 2033.
“Whenever a country says we’re going to build a new nuclear related system by a certain date, you can probably add a few more years onto that,” Korda said during a Q&A session hosted by WyoFile.
He added that the U.S. government is millions of dollars over budget, and is now extending the life of the old missiles, since the new ones aren’t ready.
“All of these delays and these cost overruns are ultimately going to trickle down to people who live in these states  and, really, to Americans who pay taxes,” Korda said.
Korda sat down with Wyoming Public Radio News Director Kamila Kudelska to talk more about the Sentinel project’s potential impacts on Wyoming. 
Editor’s Note: This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.

Kamila Kudelska: I’m eager to pick your brain about nuclear weapons in Wyoming, but first, let’s get some context. You are one of the authors of the Nuclear Notebook, which puts together estimates of nuclear forces and trends around the globe. What’s the big picture from this year so far?
Matt Korda: All nuclear armed countries, all nine countries with nuclear weapons, are currently modernizing their nuclear arsenals. What do I mean by modernizing? I mean that either they are qualitatively improving the types of weapons that they have, or they’re quantitatively increasing the number of nuclear weapons in their stockpile.

KK: Wyoming has played a role in the nation’s nuclear weapons program almost since the beginning. Can you give us some context of what the role of the F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne has been?
MK: Wyoming is really at the heart of the United States’ land-based nuclear missile component of the triad. The U.S. refers to its nuclear weapons as composing part of this triad of land, air and sea. Wyoming plays a really big role in the land-based part of that program because there are 150 silos that are deployed around the F.E. Warren Air Force Base.
KK: And what is a silo?
MK: It’s a big hole in the ground where missiles, which carry nuclear weapons, are placed into. These are something that the U.S. has had in its arsenal for the past 50, 60 years, and this modernization program that the U.S. is embarking on is going to have them for the next 50, 60 years, as well.
KK: The United States modernization effort, as I understand, it’s from the new Sentinel Nuclear Missile Program. Wyoming, along with Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Arizona will get new intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMS, or provide support. Where is the project currently?
MK: This program has been in progress now for the past maybe 15 years or so, and this is kind of just the nature of nuclear weapons programs. They take a really long time to build.
Where we’re at right now with the Sentinel is really challenging. It sort of seems like every month we get this new update as to how the missile program is either behind schedule or over budget, or there’s some other sort of thing that’s happening, whether it’s relating to mismanagement of the program, poor contractor performance, that sort of thing. This has created a lot of problems.
The initial plan for this program was to reuse a lot of the old silo infrastructure. There’s already been a ton of construction that was done during the ‘70s to build all of these different silos and place them into these various states. The hope was to save as much money as possible and reuse a lot of that infrastructure, and then just put a new missile into the same silo.
What the Air Force is now finding is that this is basically impossible. This program was sort of accelerated in many ways, but before the analysis was fully baked. And so what’s happened now is acquisition costs of the program have risen to 81% over the baseline. The original acquisition costs were supposed to be somewhere in the realm of about $77 billion in 2020.
Now we’re at about $140 [billion], and what’s happened is that that has triggered a breach of what’s called the Nunn-McCurdy Act, which is this act in Congress that says you’re not supposed to go 25% over budget. If you do go 25% over budget, then the program basically has to be scrutinized really heavily by the Department of Defense.
There’s a lot of work that has to be done to change things. We’re seeing that there’s gonna be a lot more construction than originally planned, because these various pieces of the silo that they thought they could reuse, they can’t reuse anymore. What this means is that some of these costs are going to trickle down to taxpayers.
In addition, there are challenges with landowners, because the plan was originally that the Air Force was going to just use the same kind of cabling that already exists underground for the new silos. Now that that’s not possible, they have to go and dig new holes, new passageways for the cabling.

Warren Air Force Base had the two conduct the test in tandem with an associated launch control center in Nebraska. (Staff Sgt. Christopher Ruano/U.S. Air Force)

This is going to require more land that gets leased to the Air Force by local farmers and ranchers, and other folks who own that land. The Air Force is preparing to go around to these different folks who own this land and basically offer to buy it. It’s likely going to be that the landowners probably have no choice but to sell to the Air Force because this is the land that the Air Force needs for this missile program, and historically that’s how it’s worked.
KK: What’s going to come to Wyoming as a result of this project?
MK: In terms of the construction, there’s gonna be a lot of on-base construction at F.E. Warren. They’re producing a lot of buildings and things like that, new facilities that are meant to help test out the new system, that sort of thing.
There’s gonna be a lot of construction off-base as well. I mentioned that there’s going to be these new easements that are required for the new cabling.  That means that folks are going to have to sell their land to the Air Force to allow the Air Force to come in and add new fiber optic cabling underground, that sort of thing.
In addition, we’re going to see a lot of these new construction camps that pop up in the area. There’s a bunch of small ones that are coming and there’s going to be one big one coming to Kimball, Nebraska, which is quite close by. That new workforce hub is going to have approximately 2,500 to 3,000 people that are going to be added into the community.
What’s really interesting is that the Air Force completed what’s called an environmental impact statement (EIS). They talk about how the program is going to impact the local ground squirrel population and all these things. 
But what they also do is they talk about how it’s going to impact local communities. They have all these statistics on how adding this kind of influx of folks into the area is going to impact things like housing costs, rental costs, crime rates, noise, things like that, where it kind of goes down the list. The statement itself notes that there’s likely to be adverse effects to things like socioeconomics because folks are going to come into the community, and public schools will be even more in demand. So there’s things like that, that do tend to get affected when you have these major construction projects.
KK: Do we know the timeline?
MK: The plans are for about three to five years. It’s already kind of starting.
KK: You mentioned the construction site in Kimball, which is about 20 miles from the Wyoming border and about 40 miles from Cheyenne. And that could cause these local impacts, like housing and crime issues, potentially. How much say will the state or local communities have?
MK: In some ways, not a ton.
The way it’s [this project is] sort of described is that it’s too big to fail. A lot of money has already been sunk into it. It’s really challenging to push back against that. It’s challenging to even ask questions, I think, that are very reasonable: Why are we so over budget? Why are we so behind schedule? Why are landowners going to have to have these impacts to them that they didn’t anticipate? Those type of questions I think are really valid and it’s tough to even get concrete answers about those things.
What’s historically happened is that when the Air Force was figuring out where to base their missiles back in the ‘60s, local landowners did not really have a ton of say in where those missiles would be placed. It did create quite a bit of tension between local landowners, who in many ways are actually quite supportive of the military and quite supportive of the nuclear complex, but did resent the fact that there was this faceless bureaucracy that would come down and say, ‘We’re putting a missile next to your house. It’s going to devalue your land, and there really isn’t that much you can do about it.’
There are ways right now in which local residents can engage with the Air Force, and they’ve set up a hotline and there were these public town halls and things like that for folks to go and ask their questions. These are all public record, and so we can see the types of concerns that people have had. 
The big question is, are those concerns going to be taken into account? At least historically, they really weren’t. There’s one anecdotal instance in which the Air Force in the ‘60s sited a missile silo within spitting distance of someone’s house. And then when that family complained, the Air Force said, ‘Okay, then move. We’re not moving our missile. You have to move instead.’
I would hope that maybe there’s some lessons learned from that this time around, but it’s hard to know exactly how the process will go.
What we do know is that they’ve already begun to engage with local landowners. A letter was sent out from the Air Force to folks in the area surrounding F.E. Warren as recently as May of this year. It basically said, ‘Hey, we are about to start this process for the conversion of these silos. This is going to involve us acquiring more easements, and so we will be in touch shortly about how to evaluate your land and we will try and offer you fair market rate,’ and that sort of thing.
KK: You mentioned that there has been some public meetings and some concerns were raised. Do you know what those concerns were? 
MK: You can bundle them into a few different categories.
Some are just folks writing in and saying, ‘I live nearby and I just wanna stay informed.’ 
You’ll have some folks who are saying, ‘I’d really prefer that you don’t build on my land. There’s some much better land over there – my neighbor’s land, you can build over there.’
Instead, there are folks who are writing in, who have legitimate questions and concerns about the ecology in the area. They’re saying, ‘There are endangered plants and animals and trees and things like that. Is the construction going to disrupt those ecosystems?’ The Air Force has stated through their environmental impact statement that it will disrupt some of those endangered species, and so people have a lot of fair questions about that.
Then there’s other people who are writing in who are saying, ‘I support this project, I wanna learn more about it. How can I help?’ It’s actually a really wide range of things.
KK: What do you see as the benefits and downsides of this program?
MK: In terms of the benefits of this program, it fits what the U.S. deterrent strategy is right now. When you think about what nuclear weapons are for, you can really fall into a couple of different camps here. 
One is just that the mere presence of nuclear weapons is enough to make your adversaries think twice about wanting to launch at you. So in that sense, if you only have a couple of hundred nuclear weapons, that’s probably enough.
The U.S. has historically taken a really different approach to nuclear weapons. Their idea has been more about damage limitation. In the event of a nuclear crisis, the U.S. has all of these ICBMs, these intercontinental ballistic missiles that are deployed across these states to be able to hit another country with so much firepower that it will limit the damage coming back to the United States.
So it really sort of comes down to how you think about what nuclear weapons are for, as to whether or not this program is a good idea or whether it’s an unnecessary public expense.

In terms of the downsides of the program, I can see a few. One is clearly the additional construction and cost is absolutely going to affect local folks, local community members, ranchers, farmers, landowners, that sort of thing. And the costs will be borne by Americans all across the country. 
Another thing is that by having ICBMs in these areas, it makes you a target. The point of these ICBMs is they’re there to launch in a crisis and have this damage limitation mission, but they’re also there to be shot at with nuclear weapons. So if you are someone who lives in the state of Wyoming, whether you like it or not, you are a target and you are essentially the first target for a nuclear attack.
That, I think, sort of puts your relationship with, maybe, the military and with the United States government and thinking about what role you have – it raises significant questions as to whether or not that’s the type of role that you want to have in relation to your government. 
I think what’s particularly interesting is that the ICBM force, this land-based missile force, is the only part of the nuclear triad that exists among the American population. The submarines, these are for the most part relatively isolated. There’s two ports. The bomber bases, these are their own enclosed things. 
[But] the silos, you can walk up to them. They’re on people’s land. That’s amazing. They are dotted around the country. People live among them. I think that’s something that people deserve to really think quite critically about and be empowered with the information to assess this for themselves, as to whether or not that’s something that they want.

(Photo courtesy of the city of McCammon)In McCammon, local officials aren’t even sure how old the water pipes are.
But some sections could go back to the 1940s, said City Council President Aaron Hunsaker. 
So, the rural eastern Idaho town started $3 million of work to replace pipes that funnel drinking water from a nearby spring. But at the same time, McCammon is replacing a well, prompting watering restrictions, shutoffs and temporary boil orders in parts of the less than 1,000-population town.
Hunsaker said he hasn’t heard many complaints from the community, who he thinks recognize that the work needs to be done. But he knows it’s been hard. 
“With our water shut off, I think nobody has liked it,” Hunsaker told the Idaho Capital Sun. “Our school has to shut down each time we do it, because of the risk of a boil order.”
McCammon isn’t alone. 
Across Idaho, communities need more than $1 billion to work on infrastructure for wastewater and drinking water this year, a recent study by the University of Idaho McClure Center for Public Policy Research found. A small fraction have secured funding.

“This is funding that’s needed to bring systems up to a level where they’re functioning now and going forward,” said Liz Bageant, the lead economist on the study. 
But tackling those needs could get harder, as Congress considers President Donald Trump’s proposal to nearly entirely defund a federal program that funds low-interest grants for local governments to finance water infrastructure projects.
 Infrastructure report card graded Idaho’s water systems at a C+

Idaho’s needs are driven by aging facilities, the state’s fast population growth, and environmental regulations, the U of I study found. But across the U.S., communities have high needs for water infrastructure, Bageant said. 
The issue is especially acute in smaller communities, like McCammon, which have less people to spread the tax burden over. That’s most of Idaho, Bageant said.
Most of Idaho’s water systems are serving small communities, the U of I study found. That means they might need to charge local residents higher fees to pay for one-time projects and maintenance.
“When you have a small number of users, that doesn’t necessarily mean that your upgrade is going to be proportionally cheaper,” Bageant told the Sun. “… And when you do the math for a lot of these small systems, the cost is just too high for your community to bear.”
Earlier this month, the American Society of Civil Engineers’ Idaho section released the state’s latest infrastructure report card, grading Idaho’s infrastructure the same as the nation’s overall: C. That meant the state’s infrastructure was holding up, but is aging and stressed.
The state’s drinking water and wastewater infrastructure systems scored higher, at a C+. 
Idaho’s public water systems provide safe drinking water, but they “face mounting challenges from aging infrastructure, limited funding, and climate pressures,” the report found.
In 2023, more than half of Idaho’s wastewater treatment plants reported violations of the federal Clean Water Act, which were “often tied to aging equipment and capacity issues,” the report found. 
Predictable funding could help both systems, the report said: 

For drinking water, stable access to funds could help. “Long term, predictable access to federal and state infrastructure funding, paired with locally sustainable rate structures, allows utilities to recover full lifecycle costs, reduce deferred maintenance, and invest in needed upgrades while maintaining affordability.”
For wastewater, creating a dedicated state infrastructure fund “could help smaller and rural communities access consistent, matchable funding to replace aging infrastructure and comply with regulatory requirements.”

In McCammon, the city’s ongoing water projects totalled roughly six to seven million million dollars between replacing a well, water lines, and addressing other local water issues, Hunsaker said. The city’s operating budget each year is usually less than $1 million, he said.

The projects are mostly funded by federal loans and grants, and raises to local water rates. 
“It is a challenge for a rural community like our size because a million dollars for a well — it doesn’t matter if we’re a town of 1,000 people or the city of Pocatello,” Hunsaker said. “The cost is still the same. But we have fewer users that we can share that cost with.”
What’s happening in McCammon “is happening in so many towns across Idaho,” said Idaho Rural Water Association CEO Shelley Roberts. 
Wells are going out, and aquifers with dropping water levels are forcing communities to dig deeper wells, she said. 
Because water infrastructure work is expensive, local governments often delay, which can lead to more issues down the road, she said. 
“Projects are becoming more expensive, so then the project even becomes more unaffordable,” Roberts told the Sun. 
 Trump proposed nearly eliminating key federal water infrastructure fund

Water infrastructure projects are largely funded through the federal government, mostly through low-interest loans and occasional smaller grants, Roberts said. 
But Congress is debating cutting a key source of federal funding: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water and Drinking Water revolving funds. In the president’s budget proposal, Trump sought to nearly eliminate the funds, but U.S. House Republicans’ plan in July called to scale back the fund by $662 million, down to $2.1 billion, E&E News reported. 
The final pool of funds was already getting smaller in recent years, as Congress decided to set aside funds for specific communities — a practice called earmarking. 
It isn’t clear how federal funds for water projects might change, said Association of Idaho Cities Executive Director Kelley Packer. 
“We’re very, very nervous that there will be a reduction,” she said. 
The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, which distributes the federal funds for water project loans, didn’t weigh in on how impactful the federal cuts could be.

“Congress is still working through the appropriation process, including determining earmarks, and final levels … have not yet been determined,” agency spokesperson Anna Marron told the Sun in a written statement. 
An earlier draft of the agency’s written responses, shared with the Sun, discussed the proposed cuts at length. 
The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality canceled a scheduled interview with the Sun about changes to federal funding, requesting emailed questions instead. Asked about the change, Marron said “given the technical nature of these topics, and after discussing it with (the agency’s) director and the Governor’s Office, a written response was a better method of communicating our answers.”
 Idaho recently boosted state investments in water. But now, revenues are down.

Historically, the state of Idaho’s main role in funding water projects has been through matches to grants that fund the federal government’s funds for loans, Roberts said. But in recent years, Idaho has invested more — through allocating federal COVID-related funds and state general funds.
In fiscal year 2023, the Legislature appropriated $300 million from funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, which were federal COVID-relief funds, for water infrastructure, Marron said. Then in fiscal year 2024, the Legislature set aside another $23 million from the federal COVID fund and $92 million from the state’s general fund for water projects, she said. 
It isn’t clear how the state would fund water projects next year.
Idaho state agencies told 3% budget cuts will continue into 2027 and beyond

Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s state budget chief last week told state agency directors to permanently extend budget cuts the governor ordered for this year. 
Since Little ordered 3% midyear budget cuts in response to an $80 million projected budget shortfall, the state’s budget outlook improved slightly. 
This month, the Legislative Services Office projected the state was on track to end the current fiscal year next June with a $21.8 million budget surplus, the Sun reported. 
But revenues were still lower than expected, and the budget projection still didn’t account for tax cuts in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which could cost Idaho another $167 million to implement. 
A week before the latest budget projection came out, Packer with the Association of Idaho Cities said until the Legislature meets, the state’s future water investments won’t be clear.
“We hope the state revenues start to trend up, so that there’s more likelihood of them investing,” she said. “And then we will just do our work in trying to continue to educate them on the need and encourage their investments.”

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)BLAIR, Neb. — Tucked away on a hillside in Blair, the Dana College campus sat vacant for the better part of 15 years. But in recent years the property has gained new life through the work of a local nonprofit.
The private Lutheran-affiliated college closed abruptly in the summer of 2010, leaving the staff and roughly 600 students at the time in a lurch. After the land shuffled through several different owners, the property ended up in the hands of Lutheran Family Services, a nonprofit that offers family and health services.

The group has since repurposed two of the college’s aging dormitory buildings — Mickelsen and Blair Hall — into apartments, and some of the units are now occupied by young adults who have aged out of Nebraska’s foster care system. The campus grounds now have a new name: “Dana Village.”
Lutheran Family Services CEO Chris Tonniges said the nonprofit plans to renovate the remaining buildings for other uses over the next few years. Multiple Dana alumni said they are thrilled with the new direction their old campus has taken.
“We have faith now that our shining college on a hill is going to have a strong future,” said Sandra Jensen, who leads the Dana College Alumni & Friends Association.
Small colleges have been closing at an increasing pace throughout the U.S., which can prove detrimental both to the campus population and the communities they’re located in. But in Blair, while Dana College’s closure certainly made a dent, the city has survived.
Dana’s closure
Bob Coffey, president of the still-operating Dana College Foundation and who served on the college’s Board of Regents in 2010, said the regents knew the college was in financial trouble. Specifically, it was in debt to bondholders who intended to seize the campus if they weren’t paid.

Even so, Coffey said the board was hopeful about ways they could keep the college open. He said the group’s main avenue was to shift the college to a for-profit model, but when regents were denied by accreditors, they didn’t have enough money to remain open for another year. The college closed that summer.
The closure was “brutal” to the college’s community, Coffey said, as most were not expecting it, and there was no telling what would come next.
“There’s no blueprint to follow when a college closes,” he said. “People think they will be there forever.”
Many alumni also have strong emotional ties to the campus. Coffey was the second generation in his family to attend Dana College, and started his schooling there 55 years ago. He got tearful recalling the “family” environment that was forged there between the students and their professors.
“They weren’t there to do research,” Coffey said. “They were there to do teaching.”
Dana’s closure also had a major impact on Blair’s business community, as the student population contributed between 300-500 part-time workers each year, according to Mike Rooks, director of Washington County Economic Development.
Blair City Administrator Phil Green called Dana College the “backbone” of Blair’s part-time workforce. The sudden loss of a consistent base of workers made it harder for Blair officials to attract new businesses, Rooks said. Thankfully, several other factors helped the city recover.

One major factor is that Blair is less than a 30-minute drive away from Omaha. Rooks said this offers “the best of both worlds” to residents, who can enjoy Blair’s small-town vibes and the amenities of a larger city.
While Blair serves as a “bedroom community” for many Omaha workers, Green said, there are also plenty of Omaha residents who commute to Blair for work. The city features an industrial park that is one of the largest biorefineries in the Midwest, Rooks said. It hosts multiple companies, including Cargill. Green said the number of workers at the industrial park nearly doubles Blair’s population during the day.
Fifteen years after Dana College closed its doors, Green said Blair has restored its population and workforce back to what it once was. The city’s total population has grown by about 300 people since 2010, and now stands at just under 8,000 residents.
“We’ve been growing, but it just doesn’t look like it,” Green said.
Ownership of the 150-acre hillside campus stayed with the bank for several years. Green said the city had no interest in acquiring the property because of all the associated costs of maintenance.
The land was briefly owned by Midland University, a private college based in Fremont. Green said city officials saw transferring the property to another college as the smoothest option. However, when then-Midland President Ben Sasse left to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, interest in transitioning the campus died out.

Eventually, Dana’s former campus was acquired by Ed Shada and his nonprofit Angels Share. According to Bev Carlson, associate vice president of communications for Lutheran Family Services (LFS), Shada more or less single-handedly organized the refurbishment of what was once the youngest building on Dana’s campus, which opened in 2003, into suite-style housing for people in need. That building reopened for its new purpose in 2021.
Shada had plans to renovate more buildings for housing, but Carlson said he ultimately realized it was more than a one-man job. This was how he got connected with LFS, where he now works on its development team.
What happened next?
After Lutheran Family Services took over the property, it stuck to Shada’s vision to repurpose campus buildings. In early 2024, the group officially opened two former dormitory buildings that now serve as apartments.
Including the building Shada repurposed, the three buildings host 73 housing units, and all but two of those units are occupied, said Stephanie Gardeman, the group’s director of transitional living. Fourteen are occupied by young adults ages 18-25 that have aged out of the foster care system, she said.
Every year, roughly 300 people age out of Nebraska’s foster system after they turn 18, Gardeman said. Many quickly become homeless, she said, if their foster family is unable or unwilling to continue caring for them.

Such was the case for Derek Maxwell, who was in and out of foster care from the age of 4. He was kicked out of his home at 19. Now 25, Maxwell got connected to the Dana Village program while doing research for a college paper on Nebraska’s foster care system.
These residents pay rent, but at a subsidized rate with maximum out-of-pocket costs of $450 a month, Gardeman said. They offer additional rental assistance based on need, and offer case management services that typically last about one-year per resident.
Lutheran Family Services fully furnishes the units with brand new furniture, which the program’s participants can take with them when they move out, Gardeman said. Most residents have had little to call their own for their entire lives — and rarely ever own any new items — so the fully furnished apartments often come as a shock, she said.
Gardeman described older kids within Nebraska’s foster system as a sort of “forgotten population,” as most parents hoping to adopt out of the system are looking for younger children or infants.
Maxwell said most foster kids live without certainty about how long they will be able to stay in a given household. In one of his homes, for example, he said he was kicked out without any warning. It’s the consistency that Dana Village’s housing provided that he said has made the biggest difference in his life.
“I know that I’m safe here and that it’s my home, and I don’t have to move,” Maxwell said.

Those transitioning out of the foster care system often have dealt with limited access to resources for most of their lives, Gardeman said. Maxwell lived with braces for eight years, despite not needing them for more than three.
He got them applied while he was in foster care, but by the time he could get them off he was out of the system and lacked resources to get them removed. A couple weeks ago, Gardeman was able to get him an appointment to have them removed without Maxwell needing to pay.
Aside from some original tile flooring and a few other small features, everything inside the two dormitory buildings has been replaced, Tonniges said. One of the buildings was in such disrepair that the group had space to install an elevator, he said.
In total, the refurbishment of both buildings took about two-and-a-half years to complete and cost about $17 million, Tonniges said. Most of that was donor-funded.

To the uninformed, the apartments appear pretty standard, with shiny new appliances including a washer and dryer in each unit. They’re also compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Carlson said.
Out of the roughly dozen buildings that make up Dana’s campus, less than half are currently operational. In addition to the three buildings for housing, one more building — the Margre Henningson Durham Center — is used by Lutheran Family Services, Dana’s alumni group and Christ Lutheran Church.
The old gymnasium also gets occasional use from sports groups and plays host to annual homecoming celebrations for alumni. Jensen said the homecoming events typically attract between 120-150 attendees.
Signs of the former college remain prevalent across campus, but especially in the gym, where there logos of the college advertising their mascot — the Vikings — can be seen throughout the building.
While the building is in use, Tonniges said no updates have been made since 2010. The gym has working electricity but lacks many other amenities like a working HVAC system.
Signs of age also show in subtler ways. Tonniges said during the winter, the corner walls of the basketball court become see-through because they separate due to the temperature.
Looking to the future
Lutheran Family Services has been working through a 10-year plan for the campus and plans to release a fuller masterplan this year, Tonniges said. The first phase was refurbishing the dorms into apartments, Carlson said.
Most of the remaining buildings were built in the 1950s and 60s, Tonniges said. Because of the college’s abrupt closure, the interiors have been largely untouched and serve as a sort of time capsule back to 2010.
The old library, for example, still has about 50,000 books that were on the shelves when Dana closed its doors, which have been collecting dust.

But the fight to preserve history also combats wear and tear. Most of the unoccupied buildings are currently unsafe for people to enter, Tonniges said, due to concerns about air quality or stability.
On top of that, the nonprofit has been battling vandals who sometimes break in and damage property, along with critters that sneak in and wreak havoc. Tonniges compared the challenge to a game of “whack-a-mole.”
Eventually, Tonniges said LFS would like to reopen all the buildings on campus. His goal is to offer between 400-600 housing units, but he acknowledged that not every building can be repurposed that way.
At this point, Tonniges said LFS has a “big picture” view of what it wants to do with the campus, but the group doesn’t yet have the hard details ironed out. The next phase of the 10-year plan LFS is focused on is fixing the gym.
Carlson said the group plans to continue partnering with the city and other organizations on ideas for how the extra space could be used. She said she hopes they can eventually turn the campus into a destination for the city.
As far as Dana’s alumni are concerned, Jensen and Coffey said they are happy to see their alma mater serving people again. Each observed that though the operation is different, the vision is similar — helping young people prepare for their futures.
“It’s still keeping with the mission,” Coffey said. “It’s just a little bit different direction.”

FOSCOE — Sherrye Trice pulled up to the store five minutes before it opened, holding a box of diapers with her phone on speaker.
She unlocked the front door, flicked the lights on and made her way back to the storage rooms. After sliding the diapers onto a storage shelf, she began quickly moving bunches of bananas into a new container for the produce section up front.
She froze and covered her mouth when the person on the other end of the phone told her they planned to make a sizable donation, and to match others’ donations for a time.
“You just made my day,” she said, wiping tears from her eyes. After a minute, she hung up the call, took a deep breath and picked up the box of bananas. Shoppers were already waiting outside.
“Good morning, everybody!”

‘A safety net for the high country’
Trice had two volunteers this Wednesday morning.
Luke Barber, a freelance journalist-turned-Appalacian State student, planned to help Trice with everything tech and media. Michelle Daoust, a crisis counselor with the state’s Hope4NC program, comes by weekly to lend a hand.
“You, young man, are going to get to follow me around and chase me today,” Trice said, motioning to Barber. “Because that’s the only way I can get anything done.”
Daoust turned to help the first visitors of the day. They each grabbed a one-gallon white bucket — the store’s version of a shopping cart — and began to walk down the canned goods aisle.
At Foscoe Home Team’s Storm Relief Store, groceries are free. And customers are limited to those living in Ashe, Watauga and Avery counties, all hit by Hurricane Helene. Almost 80 households who are among the store’s frequent shoppers still don’t have reliable running water — still relying on bottles to cook, clean and bathe. “A safety net for the High Country,” is how Trice described the store to the donor on the phone.
Helene hit on Sept. 27, 2024, an unthinkable storm that flooded and buried homes and livelihoods in the mountains. The needs of many are now less a matter of life and death, but for Trice they are no less urgent.
So the store stays open — accepting donations and handing out food, clothes and other basic needs — five days a week. And for the next few hours, a steady parade of cars arrived at the white-sided building in Watauga County, tucked below the Grandfather Mountain.









Trice is constantly dictating text messages to volunteers, friends and neighbors as she dashes around the store. Her iPhone is, it seems, permanently connected to a portable charging bank.

The store is a charity, but there are rules. Verifying your identity and address is non-negotiable. Food and other items have strict limits per person. Each shopper gets one white bucket — and it can’t overflow. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)

Another chilly mountain winter looms in western North Carolina. “When this weather changes, we’re going to be in trouble again,"" Trice said. In the back of the store, two boxes are labeled for adult and children’s gloves. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)







“Nobody is freezing to death,” said Trice. “People have power back. Even if they don’t have drinking water, they’ve got showering water.” But another chilly mountain winter looms. “When this weather changes, we’re going to be in trouble again.” (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
‘I’m the one who lays awake at night when we don’t have enough’
Trice isn’t keen to talk about herself. “I’ll text you the interviews,” she said, dashing off links to a previous radio hit and Facebook video about her and the store.
The short version: She’s an Army veteran whose family has lived in the area for generations. She began collecting donations just days after Helene, at an Avery County community center. Now she has a formal 501(c)(3) for Foscoe Home Team and a two-year lease in the building off N.C. Highway 105, a 15 minute drive from the town of Banner Elk.
She doesn’t take a salary, and donated the amount that would’ve been her pay for the first year back to the nonprofit.
Pen and paper govern the store — workers jot down first-time customers’ info on index cards and verify it with their drivers’ licenses. Trice is “hopeless” with technology, by her own admission. But she’s very familiar with the voice-to-text function, and is constantly dictating text messages to volunteers, friends and neighbors as she dashes around the store. Her iPhone is, it seems, permanently connected to a portable charging bank.
One veteran’s description of Trice running the store: “Not unlike a base commander in a combat operation.”
Wednesdays are usually a bit less busy, and there was a bit of free time between customers. Daoust and Trice took a quick inventory: canned meats are running low, and shampoo and body wash remain big needs. The store doesn’t have any corporate donors, but Trice said they’re “dying” for them: “we’ll take pallets.”
Trice needed to run by Food Lion and the bank. But the errands will have to wait; she doesn’t want to leave the store for too long.
The summer has brought some reprieve. “Nobody is freezing to death,” Trice said. “People have power back. Even if they don’t have drinking water, they’ve got showering water.” But another chilly mountain winter looms. “When this weather changes, we’re going to be in trouble again.” In the back of the store, two boxes are labeled for adult and children’s gloves.
The store is a charity, but there are rules. Verifying your identity and address is non-negotiable. Food and other items have strict limits per person. Each shopper gets one white bucket — and it can’t overflow.
“I do feel bad sometimes,” Daoust said quietly, about the per-person limits.
“It’s not personal,” Trice replied. “I just remember that I’m the one who lays awake at night if we don’t have enough.”
‘They need to be able to talk to somebody’
Zane Tester backed his car up to the front of the store. He waited in the driver’s seat while his dog Sammy impatiently pawed around the back, and a couple plastic bags of essential goods were dropped in the trunk.
Tester was the police chief up in Boone for decades. In the years since, he’s served as a pastor at churches around the area — a “country preacher,” he calls himself.
“It was tough on us, tough on everybody,” he said of Helene. “The little church I pastor, it tore the fellowship hall to pieces. It got the furnace in the big church.”
“A pastor needs to be there. I couldn’t be there.”

Tester is fighting Crohn’s disease. He’s been told time and again to stay home and take care of himself. But dozens of churches in the region still lack regular pastors, he said.
“If we ever needed guidance, a lot of people need it right now,” Tester said. “A lot of people are so discouraged, have so much anxiety, they can’t do nothing. They need to be able to talk to somebody.”
‘I might not have it, but I’ll find a way to try to get it for you’
Jacob Roninger comes by the store most days to pick up the trash and cardboard.
He works just a few minutes away, where he manages the barn and tends to Grandfather Stables. That’s where he was when the flooding began, washing away the fencing and forcing him to bring the horses in.
Roninger spent three weeks after the storm fixing the fences and cleaning. His mother also lives nearby. The small creek by her home had washed out the foundation of three separate buildings.
“I’ve noticed that when it rains now … it don’t take much for it to start flooding,” he said.
Months ago, Roninger saw a sign Trice had posted along the road and pulled into the lot. He’s been a regular since, hauling away garbage bags and folded-up boxes in his truck.
“I do the best that I can,” he said. “I help whoever needs help.”
As he drove around the area after Helene, he recalled seeing mobile homes washed away, leaving some living in tents and others totally homeless.

Marcia Grimes counts herself among the lucky ones. She and her husband stood on top of their 43-year-old mobile home as the water rushed through a year ago, she recalled as she walked back to her car from the store.
Grimes lives in a mobile home community behind a Walmart in Boone. Before the storm, she estimates there were more than 100 homes there. Now there are about 20.
The slanted street their home sits on prevented total loss, but their new SUV suffered some water damage. As she remarked several times: others had it far worse.
“There’s people … who still don’t have anything,” Grimes said. “I’m a people person, I’ll talk to anybody. I might not have it, but I’ll find a way to try to get it to you.”
‘It ain’t junk in there’
Boxes are stuffed like Tetris pieces in the back of the white SUV now sitting in front of the store. One of its four passengers walks in to find Trice, while the others begin unpacking the trunk.
The group of men come from American Legion Post 48 in Hickory, an hour south. They’ve made donation trips to every county in the west since Helene, and multiple trips to most of them.
One of them, John Harden, loaded up his car days after the storm: warm clothes, quilts and blankets, canned goods. His wife died eight years ago, and he had plenty to give that he’d never use himself.
“We had a lot of winter coats that looked like new,” Harden said. “I just cleaned them out.”
The 90-year-old has made dozens of trips around the mountains since, alongside his fellow veterans, though he admits that now he’s “slowed down” a bit.

“A friend of mine is a production manager for Trevor Noah,” Trice said, grinning ear to ear. The box was full of signed copies of the comedian’s memoir. She’d be auctioning them off at the store’s fundraiser in weeks. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)

Wednesday’s boxes were packed with, among other things, winter clothes and candy. “Good stuff,” one of the veterans remarked. “It ain’t junk in there, let me tell you what.”
The delivery didn’t come at the best time for Trice, who was also juggling multiple customers. “Next time guys, please call,” she pleaded. But it was hard for her to be too annoyed as she began to hang flannels and jackets on the clothing racks outside the store.
Harden recalled one trip they made around Easter, with boxes of toys. A boy approached him and asked if he could have the last toy left — a doll.
“I said, ‘you play with dolls?’” he remembered asking the boy. “And he said, ‘no, but I want to give it to my sister.’”
Trice ducked away from the SUV and approached another car, a blue Jeep that just pulled up. After a moment, she walked back into the store holding an Amazon Prime box.
“A friend of mine is a production manager for Trevor Noah,” she said, grinning ear to ear. The box was full of signed copies of the comedian’s memoir. She’d be auctioning them off at the store’s fundraiser in weeks.
‘We’ll be waiting here’
Connie Aldridge starts helping unload the boxes from the American Legion car. She’s a neighbor — the next road over bears her surname — and a veteran, like Trice.
“Just by the grace of God, I met her,” Aldrige said. “And she didn’t stop. I had to get a job to pay my bills, so I went back to work. I stop by randomly, and she puts me to work. She’s good at it.”
She had returned to the region from military service just before Helene struck. She remembered seeing people on the other side of surging rivers and creeks, asking if she could get them food.
They’ve made strides in the year since, despite all the frustrations that remain. And Aldridge is hoping to soon see a steady stream of visitors again — for travelers and outsiders to come re-discover the stretch of the mountains they call home.
“Come see what’s hiding behind that next knoll,” she said. “We’ll be waiting here. Lots of us were taught to suffer, in silence. It doesn’t have to be that way.”

The hefty price tag, highlighted in a newly released report by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth, comes after two consecutive years of corporate tax breaks have squeezed revenues — and as state leaders head into fall budget planning for the next fiscal year.
The federal overhaul is also occurring as hunger levels remain high in Tennessee. More than 700,000 Tennesseans — or one in every 10 state residents – rely on the SNAP program to put food on the table. But a larger portion of the population, more than 1.1 million people in Tennessee, experience hunger, a third of them children, according to Feeding America.
“These are the deepest cuts to SNAP we have ever seen to the program. It will make it harder for Tennesseans to make ends meet, and that hurts our communities and our economy.” said Signe Anderson, senior director of nutrition advocacy for the Tennessee Justice Center.
SNAP provides monthly assistance to people below the poverty line in the form of loaded debit cards to use at the grocery store. The average family on SNAP in Tennessee receives about $340 per month.
Until now the federal government has paid half of the $128 million in administrative costs Tennessee incurs to run the program and picked up the tab for the entire $800 million in cash benefits, according to 2023 data published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Under the new Trump administration law, states starting in 2026 will have to pick up 75% of the administrative costs and an escalating percentage of the cash benefit beginning in 2027 — an amount tied to state error rates in processing applications. Paying out too much or too little in SNAP benefits is an error.
Three charts showing the impact of the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ on Tennessee

Tennessee, which had an error rate of just under 10% in the last fiscal year, could be responsible for 10% of the $800 million in cash assistance.
An analysis by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth estimated the cost to the state to preserve benefits only for children could require an additional $110 million in state revenue.
States are required to provide SNAP benefits to anyone who qualifies and the federal government sets the benefit amount, limiting the ability of states to rejigger the program. States squeezed by their new cost-sharing responsibilities could opt to end SNAP benefits entirely, Anderson said.
The state has released no comprehensive analysis of the impact of SNAP changes to Tennessee and the final outlook is complicated by other cuts to the program mandated by the Trump administration.
The new federal law requires states to exclude refugees, asylum seekers and immigrant crime victims from receiving benefits, a number that food advocates said is relatively small in Tennessee. 
The law also expands work requirements. The majority of SNAP recipients in Tennessee are already required to work, receive training or attend school until they are 54 years old, but will now have to work until age 64 to receive SNAP — a change that is expected to disqualify many older recipients. Another shift in work requirements will require parents of children 14 and older to work or go to school; previously the requirement was for parents with kids 16 and up.
Danielle Cotton, a spokesperson for the Department of Human Services, said her agency is currently examining the impact of the federal law and expects to release new details during budget hearings in November.
“We look forward to sharing the specific information with the public at the Department’s public budget hearing with Governor Lee, Commissioner Bryson, Director Thurman, and Chief Gibson,” she said.

(Photo courtesy of Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue)Ron Christensen of Nampa does not think of himself as a hero, although he checks off all the boxes. The same goes for the more than 100 volunteers associated with the nonprofit Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue. 
They are not in it for money or recognition. 
Christensen, 67, is a coordinator for the rescue operation and has spent 12 years either leading or participating in back-country missions. As with other volunteers, holidays are not a given for “peaceful” time with the family.
Boise-based foundation has the backs of our wildland firefighters

“Over the years, I’ve been out during every holiday on the calendar,” he said. “Operations never happen at a convenient time, but when we are sent out on a call, we have an expectation to respond and be at our compound within an hour. That means that people are literally dropping whatever they are doing and going to where they need to be within an hour’s time.”
For no pay. 
And along the way, rescue teams often are navigating extreme weather and fighting through darkness – from the desert in Owyhee County to the terrain of the Sawtooths and Boulder-White Clouds Wilderness.
Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue is not a high-profile operation by any means. Every year, some of the volunteers can be seen selling hot-buttered corn at the Western Idaho State Fair, the organization’s major fund-raising venture. But few people have reason to think much about the group.
Until they are needed, somewhere in the backcountry of Idaho, Oregon and Nevada. And it’s an operation that local sheriffs can’t do without.
Four years ago, the rescue group was a matter of life and death for Connor Bass, who at that time was a student at Boise State University. Bass was snowboarding at Bogus Basin when he went off the course and basically into no-man’s land. The ski patrol had an idea where he went, but couldn’t locate him.
To say the least, it was an eventful time for the rescue team, Connor and his frantic mother (Tara Schaak), who spent the night wondering if her son was alive. The temperature was somewhere around 20 degrees and Connor was not dressed for the occasion.
There is a happy ending to this one. Darryl Beemer, who was part of the rescue team, found Connor and it was all smiles and hugs. Connor was cold, tired and hungry, but otherwise OK.
“All in all, it was pretty straight forward from our standpoint, although it was an unexpected long night for somebody who was out there,” Christensen says. “We’re always glad to see a positive outcome, then we quietly and humbly put away our gear and prepare for the next call.”
Not all calls end up with positive outcomes.
“During the year, we average around 40 missions. Sometimes, an operation ends up being a recovery, and that’s important too,” he says. “There’s satisfaction that comes from this, and parts of it we enjoy. We all like the outdoors, the friendships and the camaraderie and, obviously, we like helping people. You work with a lot of good people and multiple law-enforcement agencies. All have a common goal – to make a difference.”
Ask Tara Schaak about the difference the Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue makes. 
“I write to them every year to thank them for how they changed our lives,” she said.
To her son, Connor, his experience four years ago put him on a career path. Now 25, he’s a firefighter in the small town of Poulsbo, Washington.
“When going into firefighting, I was asked ‘why.’ For me, my ‘why’ is that I’ve been in a situation when I needed emergency services to come to my rescue. They showed up with all the tools, technologies and everything they had to provide that service to me. They also had the level of empathy that will always be with me,” he said.
“I’m the goofball that got lost, but they were not judgmental. Rather, they were like a new set of friends that I found,” he said. “For me, as a firefighter, that is something I will always take with me – understanding what it’s like to need help, then providing that help with empathy and no judgments. So, that’s my ‘why.’ I want to show up for other people when they need it and show up really well.”
That’s what’s called paying it forward.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)As students entered their classrooms at Simle Middle School in Bismarck Wednesday morning, they instinctively went to the back of the room where a wall hanger with numbered pockets was attached to a cupboard door, waiting for their cellphones.
They slipped their phones into one of the numbered slots, one after another, and then took their seats.
No fuss. No comments. Straight into the business of the school day.
North Dakota schools implemented a bell-to-bell cellphone restriction for the 2025-26 school year after state lawmakers passed the ban during the 2025 legislative session with the backing of Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
Some schools needed to craft new cellphone policies from scratch, but others, like Simle Middle School, had restricted phones last year, which lessened the impact of the new law, said Randy Lamberth, assistant principal for the middle school.
“Ultimately, what we see is kids have their heads up in the hallway,” Lamberth said.
Last year’s school policy forced kids to have their phones stowed in a locker or backpack, and the change for them this year was turning the phones into faculty at the start of the day and picking them up at the end of the day.
“There’s not a lot of pushback from our kids,” Lamberth said. Disciplinary actions for student phone use have been minimal during the first month of classes, he said.
Gov. Armstrong advocates for eliminating student cellphone use in public schools

Serenity Horne, 14, eighth grader at Simle Middle School, said not much has changed in the cellphone rules between last year and this year.
“It’s been a lot less drama-wise,” Horne said. “There were a lot of kids last year that went to the bathroom to use their phones and now we don’t have that.”
She said she’s noticed the teachers getting more attention from students and she also feels more focused during the school day.
Charlie Reich, 12, seventh grader at Simle Middle School, said he has also noticed students seem to be more focused.
“It feels normal,” Reich said. He added he thinks not having his phone during school hours will help him be a better student.
Bismarck Public Schools Superintendent Jeff Fastnacht said administrators around the district thought the new cellphone policy was going to be a “tough sell” for kids and parents.
“That didn’t materialize the same way that was maybe predicted,” Fastnacht said.
He said only about 50 disciplinary incidents have been reported at Bismarck schools.
“That’s districtwide. That’s 14,000 kids,” Fastnacht said. “That’s miniscule.”
He said the district has seen an increase in medical exemption requests from parents who want their kids to still have access to their phones during the day to monitor medical conditions, and the district is accommodating those requests.
Gov. Armstrong signs bill banning public school student cellphone use in North Dakota

When asked if he believed the law needed to be changed at all during the next legislative session, Fastnacht said lawmakers could clarify what type of medical professionals can authorize a medical exemption for cellphone use.
“Who should be that prescribing doctor that says you need to have access to your phone?” he said. “The law pretty much says it can be whatever they provide us.”
Some schools in the district have rolled a board game and puzzle cart into their lunch rooms to give students more entertainment while they eat and socialize, which used to be a time when students would scroll on their phones, Fastnacht said. 
Audra Zimmerman, principal at Williston Middle School Central Campus, said cellphones were rooted in many of the behavioral problems they were seeing two years ago at the school of about 1,600 students.
“All the fights, and they were recording everything. It was causing a huge disruption,” Zimmerman said. 
To address those problems, the district restricted cellphone use by students last year and required them to check them in with their homeroom teachers at the beginning of the day, she said. If students were caught with devices, they would be warned, and if they were caught again the phones would be turned into the office for a parent to pick up.
With the new state law, the discipline has become more strict and the warnings have been tossed out, Zimmerman said. This year, students caught with their cellphones are immediately met with an in-school suspension, she said.
She said she has also heard criticism from parents this year about teachers being on their phones during the school day. Zimmerman pointed out that teachers need to have their phones because the school uses them to issue emergency alerts.
“If we need a team member to assist a student, if we need a team member to assist another staff member, or there is a medical emergency, it’s all communicated through phones,” she said. 
Williston High School Principal Audrey Larson said teachers are not having to constantly battle students over using their phones. Administrators have taken on a little more of an enforcement role, but they expected that role to increase in the lead-up to the school year.
But, she said the cellphone incidents have been decreasing at the high school as the weeks roll by.
“I think the first few weeks, obviously, we saw a little bit more, but as kids hear that it’s serious, it’s been less and less all the time, so that’s positive because kids are learning,” Larson said. “We’re seeing much less of the Snapchat drama than we used to.”

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)A federally funded program that would have provided $156 million to low-income Tennessee families for solar panel installation has been terminated after several months on hold, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation announced Friday.
The funding was part of the $7 billion Solar for All program, which was designed to create or expand solar programs for about 900,000 low-income households nationwide. Tennessee was one of 49 states selected to receive awards authorized by Congress through the Inflation Reduction Act. 
Suspending Inflation Reduction Act funding disbursements — particularly spending that involved clean energy initiatives — was one of President Donald Trump’s first actions upon taking office in January. The executive order freezing the funds spurred lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s ability to rescind already-authorized funds.
Tennessee’s Office of Energy Programs was in the process of developing the state’s Solar for All Program guidelines when the Environmental Protection Agency terminated the award in early August, according to the office’s website.
“(The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s Office of Energy Programs) thanks its stakeholders for their interest, time, and significant contributions to Tennessee’s Solar for All proposal and subsequent program design efforts,” the department wrote in Friday’s announcement.

(Jeremy Stevens for Louisiana Illuminator)LAKE CHARLES – Federal regulators have directed a Louisiana casino to sever ties with a former executive who they say failed to alert auditors and potential investors about fraud allegations. The person in question is now a consultant for the casino.  
The National Indian Gaming Commission ordered the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission to suspend the license of Todd Stewart, who was general manager of the Coushatta Casino Resort in Kinder. The federal agency issued the directive in a Sept. 8 letter to the tribe, according to documents the Illuminator has obtained.
Shawna Castellano, a regional director with the National Indian Gaming Commission, wrote in the letter that her agency received a complaint last year that alleged former Coushatta tribal chairman Johnathan Cernek had misused gaming revenues. Those claims were later confirmed through an accounting firm’s audit of the casino, the letter said.

Earlier this month, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor published a report from a separate independent audit that indicated the Coushatta tribe’s leadership did not keep track of credit card use, with no receipts to show for purchases totaling more than $100,000 over a two-month spending period in 2024 that was reviewed. 
Cernek resigned as tribal chairman in August 2024, KPLC-TV reported. Tribal council member Crystal Williams was named acting chairperson after Cernek stepped down, and new tribal chairman David Sickey was sworn in June 13. 
Williams and tribal secretary treasurer Kristian Poncho have not responded to questions from the Illuminator about how financial concerns were reported to them, when they were made aware of potential fraud involving the use of casino credit cards or the quality of information council leadership received from management and auditors during that time. 
Sickey did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and tribe spokeswoman Mary Patricia Wray declined to respond before the deadline for this report. 
According to Castellano’s letter, the commission interviewed Stewart on June 5 and learned he did not “disclose suspected fraud to the external auditors during the [fiscal year] 2023 annual audit of the financial statements.” Stewart also didn’t discuss the matter with “the potential lender of a $150 million construction loan the Coushatta Casino was in the process of obtaining” until the loan was actually secured, the letter said.
The Coushatta Casino Resort broke ground on a new $150 million hotel in March 2024. 
The regulator’s three-page letter, sent to Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission Chairwoman Pam Bass, also alleges Stewart was “unsure of how many credit cards were associated with the Casino bank accounts and uncertain of who was using the Casino credit cards.”
Stewart has not responded to phone calls or emailed questions from the Illuminator about how financial concerns were reported to him, his suspicions of Cernek regarding credit card spending or the scope of his current role as a consultant for the casino.
The National Indian Gaming Council declined to provide additional information about its actions involving the Coushatta tribe.
When the Illuminator reported earlier this month on the audit findings posted on the Legislative Auditor’s website, the tribal council provided a statement through its spokeswoman. It said the council’s credit cards had been eliminated, and the tribe had adopted a formal expense reporting and reimbursement policy.
Hours after the Illuminator published findings from the audit, the report was removed from the Legislative Auditor’s website. Officials said they were discussing whether the state should have posted it on their website in the first place. An attorney with the auditor’s office said federal regulations allow tribes to opt out of having their audit reports made public.
According to the letter from federal regulators, the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission must issue a hearing notice for Stewart’s potential license revocation and notify regulators of its decision within 45 days.
Members of the tribe’s gaming commission could not be reached for comment.

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)As we begin our seventh year as a carwash marketing agency in Wisconsin, we’re daily confronted with challenges like scaling, taking on investors and staying competitive in a saturated market. Yet consistently the toughest issue to navigate has been how to approach health care for our employees amid national uncertainty.
Since health care is largely tied to employment, one of our earliest priorities was to make sure that we could be in a position to offer affordable, comprehensive coverage to our employees. And here we are, a few years later, still unable to swing it.
With the current federal administration and the recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, as we go forward, for brevity and so I don’t need to use those words together), our lofty goal of offering the most basic benefits to our employees seems more of a pipe dream than ever. While we wait for the tax breaks that are promised to trickle down from the top earners who benefit most,  we’re facing a very near-term future of funding cuts and even higher daily costs — and in the realm of health care, an uncertain few months of even higher premiums and more difficult access to basic care. Our Republican representatives are still parading the passage of the OBBBA as a win, but when it comes to the reality of the tax breaks and subsidies that are set to expire within the next few months, the silence from our Republican reps is deafening.
The OBBBA does offer tax breaks and incentives, but outside of a few breaks on  large equipment purchases in our industry, neither our customers, who are mostly small, mom and pop operators, nor we will see any benefit. We’re not in a position to fully depreciate the purchase of a private jet. In fact, because of the OBBBA and  the economic instability associated with tariff threats, we’re now facing the potential of our first year of non-growth.
As small business owners in Wisconsin, we’re watching the numbers come out on the OBBBA and realizing just how uneven this deal really is. More than 70% of the tax breaks will go to the wealthiest one-fifth of households, while the middle class gets just 10%. Here in Wisconsin, the top 1% of earners will walk away with average breaks close to $70,000. For families making under $80,000 a year, the break is less than $1,600.
When we weigh the minimal tax breaks we may see against the drastic losses in support, it’s clear this law shifts the burden onto families, state budgets and small businesses already at their limit. Medicaid cuts, in particular, threaten jobs, health care access and community well-being. The OBBBA is hailed as a win, but truly, it undermines our efforts to provide for our employees and community.
On health care, we’re coming up to a harsh deadline — the lapse of premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, an action propagated entirely by Republican lawmakers. With 90% of Americans relying on these subsidies to make coverage affordable, we’re looking at sharp increases in premiums. As a family, we’re already paying nearly $900 per month for non-substantial coverage. This is nearly the cost of our mortgage for coverage that does nothing of the sort — our out-of-pocket payments are ridiculous.
Already, insurance providers are pulling out of key markets in Wisconsin as it is no longer profitable to serve certain areas of the state. How are Wisconsinites supposed to counter this? How do people survive when premiums rise so high, it’s more cost-effective to gamble with one’s health rather than pay rates for coverage that only really serve to prevent complete financial catastrophe after one gets sick?
Ultimately, as small business owners, we can easily see the ripples from the OBBBA and the lapsing of ACA tax credits.

Premiums will continue to rise to untenable levels.
Businesses and individuals will have less money to spend.
Entrepreneurship will stall due to more hesitation to give up benefits in corporate environments.

This legislation does not help small business owners, Wisconsinites, or working families — nor does it promote a healthy local economy. Instead, it burdens those already struggling while directing gains to the top. The damaging effects of these policies will only become more obvious as the new law  unfolds.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)One year after approving Colorado’s first “clean heat plan” to reduce climate pollution in natural gas systems, state utility regulators are weighing the impact of federal clean energy rollbacks on their goals.
Roughly 10% of statewide greenhouse gas emissions comes from gas-burning heating and cooking appliances in Colorado homes and businesses. Under a first-of-its-kind 2021 state law, utilities are required to file clean heat plans outlining their efforts — mostly through investment and customer incentives for technologies like electric heat pumps — to meet emissions reduction targets.
But as the Colorado Public Utilities Commission nears a deadline to set a target for 2035, utility companies and environmental advocates are at odds over how ambitious the state should be in the absence of federal incentives. Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending bill this year fully repealed tax credits for home electrification and energy efficiency upgrades that were passed under President Joe Biden’s administration.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Led by Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electricity and natural gas provider, utilities have asked the three-member PUC to target a maximum 2035 cut of 30% below 2015 levels. A coalition of climate and environmental groups want a much more ambitious target of a 55% cut — and so does at least one sponsor of the 2021 clean heat law.
“We need to keep pushing this, because the technology is out there, but we’re seeing such huge changes in our climate right now,” former Democratic state Rep. Tracey Bernett told the commission in a Sept. 18 public hearing. “We’ve got to do something sooner, and reducing (natural gas) is the quickest way we can do it.”










Recovered methane is not going to help. We need to electrify ... We especially need to electrify in communities like mine, where they need to transition first, because we are the most vulnerable.


– Renée Millard Chacon, environmental activist and Commerce City Council member


In a PUC filing last month, Gov. Jared Polis’ administration initially proposed a middle-of-the-road 41% target for 2035. Just weeks later, however, the Colorado Energy Office and the Air Pollution Control Division weakened their proposal in an updated filing, endorsing a 31% target nearly in line with what Xcel had requested.
“What we’ve brought forward in our additional comments, in our mind, is a balance of ambition with potential achievability and cost of that transition,” Keith Hay, the energy office’s managing director for policy, told the PUC.
That target could be revised in the coming years depending on changing market conditions, he added.
“Thirty-one percent represents a real ambition, in our view, for the utilities. At the same time, there’s a lot of concern about that not being ambitious enough,” Hay said. “The commission can set that ambitious target today and come back in the 2030 timeframe, and really look at where we as a state are, where the utilities are at that point in time, and adjust that target upward or downward.”
 ‘Recovered methane’
Colorado has set a statewide goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across all economic sectors by 2050, roughly in line with recommendations from scientists to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.
Another major point of contention in the PUC’s clean heat deliberations is the question of “recovered methane” — natural gas that’s captured by landfills, wastewater treatment plants, livestock operations or other sources and traded through a credit system.
Capturing gas from these sources — sometimes called “renewable” natural gas — is better for the climate than allowing the methane to escape into the atmosphere, but it still releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants when it’s combusted. Climate advocacy groups have sought to limit the application of recovered methane credits in clean heat plans, and state law capped their use at 5% of utilities’ required emissions reductions for 2030.
“Recovered methane is not going to help. We need to electrify,” Renée Millard Chacon, an environmental activist and Commerce City Council member, told the PUC. “We especially need to electrify in communities like mine, where they need to transition first, because we are the most vulnerable.”
But Xcel has asked the PUC to “avoid limiting recovered methane going forward,” and the Polis administration has backed that request, recommending that no cap be set for the 2035 target. That has raised concerns among climate advocates that emissions cuts could be “double counted,” without resulting in real reductions in the gas utility sector.
“If you allow larger amounts of recovered methane to count, then you need to simultaneously increase the stringency for emission reductions from retail gas sales,” said Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development for Boulder-based Western Resource Advocates. “Because otherwise you’re just enabling emission reductions in other sectors, without at the same time driving down emissions from from gas utilities.”
Jack Ihle, Xcel’s regional vice president for regulatory policy, touted the company’s success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in electricity generation, while describing natural gas distribution as “one of the harder-to-decarbonize sectors.”
“It’s hard for us to fathom something that contemplates 600,000 electrification adoptions by 2035, when we have 6,000 or so right now, using a lot of best efforts, in our view,” Ihle said.
“We’re not trying to shirk that obligation,” he added. “I think everyone here is excited to do emissions reductions when we can do them reliably, affordably and achievably.”
State law requires the PUC to enact rules that set a 2035 clean heat target by Dec. 1 of this year. Commissioners said Thursday that they will continue to accept public comments while they consider adopting a rule.

Omaha’s rank is unchanged from last year but has slipped two spots since 2021 in the annual Barometer report produced for the past decade by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce and University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Bureau of Business Research. 
Omaha’s overall score in 2025 is 4% below the national average. Released Monday, this year’s 32-page report led by UNL economist Eric Thompson said the findings shine “a light on uncomfortable truths” that must be confronted with “urgency.”
 ‘Brain drain’ 

The alarm is similar to one sounded in a separate report released this month by the Aksarben Foundation, a more than century-old statewide Nebraska business organization. That research, conducted by Development Counsellors International, showed comparison cities growing jobs five times faster than Omaha. 
 

An Aksarben view
Nebraska’s two largest metro areas, Omaha and Lincoln, have lagged 68,000 jobs behind where both would have been had the markets kept pace the last five years with peers, according to the separate Aksarben Foundation report.
Peer markets for that research included Fayetteville, Arkansas, Huntsville, Alabama and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Those 68,000 occupied jobs would have generated an estimated $11 billion in additional wages, the report said, which could have resulted in $600 million to $800 million in additional tax revenue for the state.

The Lincoln market’s employment and wage growth were nearly identical to Omaha’s, Aksarben leaders said, adding that such “lack of performance” from Nebraska’s two biggest economies represents a potential loss of billions of dollars in wages that could have led to hundreds of millions in tax revenue for the State of Nebraska, which faces a hefty budget shortfall. 
Both reports lament “brain drain,” the exodus of young educated talent from the state. The chamber calls the findings one of the “uncomfortable truths.” Aksarben says brain drain is “far more significant economically than simply an inconvenient truth.”
The chamber report says growth in the number of college graduates ages 25 to 34 is important to workforce strength, yet that population in the Omaha metro from 2019-2023 grew by 1.5%  —  slower than the national growth rate of 6%. By that measure, Omaha scored less than all 23 metros except Columbus, Ohio, and Pittsburgh.
A data-driven effort and survey last year by the chamber and University of Nebraska at Omaha spotlighted some key ways to stop the loss of young talent, including investing in more public transit options, better salaries and flexible scheduling. More than three-quarters of those surveyed described a workplace focus on diversity, equity and inclusion as a “good thing.”
For employment growth, a data point that reflects expansion of private and government job opportunities, the chamber report showed an Omaha growth rate of nearly 1.5% per year from 2021 through 2024 — slower than all its comparison metros except Milwaukee.

“We are not growing our workforce fast enough. We are not retaining enough of our college graduates. We are not adding jobs or raising private sector wages at the pace needed to stay competitive,” the report stated.
Researchers said high taxes and educational attainment gaps are a further drag on the economic outlook of the eight-county Omaha metro area that recently surpassed the million-person mark.
The report noted that sales and income tax rates influence human capital development, as workers will invest more at work and in education if they expect to keep more of the earnings those investments generate. Of the metros the study included, Omaha ranked above only Greenville, S.C., and Buffalo N.Y., for sales and income tax rates, and its position has slipped over the last few years.
“The stark reality is that Greater Omaha must grow faster — faster in employment, faster in wages, faster in residents,” Heath Mello, chamber president and CEO, said in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner.
Highs and lows 
Thompson said the latest economic report card also points out “numerous strengths including higher education attainment, labor force participation and the quality of life” in the Omaha area.
In developing the report, his team looked at nine general areas and drilled down into 50 data points. The chamber says the results help gauge how the Omaha area stacks up against other metros jockeying for position in a “race for the future.”

Omaha’s progress has been outpaced by high-performing comparison metros, the chamber said. Denver, Nashville, Austin, Salt Lake City and Raleigh have held the highest rankings over the past four years.
Omaha’s highest marks came in areas related to quality of life (ranked 8th), innovation (11th) and entrepreneurship (11th).
Driven by arts and cultural opportunities and quick commute times, Omaha maintained its No. 8 eighth quality of life ranking from last year. Fun fact: Omaha’s average commute is 20.9 minutes, almost six minutes faster than the national average, the report said. 
The report comes as Omaha has tried to spice up its allure, with multimillion dollar developments, including the modern-day streetcar project poised to run from downtown to midtown, the overhaul of downtown parks and amenities as “The RiverFront,” continued growth of the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus and other redevelopment sites across the metro.
Omaha improved its showing in the entrepreneurship category, jumping to No. 11 from last year’s No. 14. On average, the report said, Omaha-area entrepreneurs earn more than those in other metros.

“We are outpacing these metros and the nation at large in GDP growth, keeping down industrial energy costs and demonstrating strong outcomes in unemployment, poverty reduction and closing the gender earnings gap,” the report said.
However, some of Omaha’’s lowest scores showed up in “human capital” — an area researchers described as critical to growth that reflects educational and occupational skills of the workforce. 
Human capital is the area that captures the lag in growth of college graduates and income and sales tax burdens relative to other metros. Omaha placed 20th in the human capital category — a fall from 17th four years ago.
The Omaha chamber, which represents nearly 3,000 member companies, including businesses of all sizes, expects the report to inform employers and policy-makers about where dollars and focus should go.
Moving forward, the Omaha chamber said it plans a focus on three areas: growing and retaining talent, accelerating business growth and positioning the Omaha area “more boldly” on the national stage.
That means investing in “groundbreaking research” to understand why brain drain is happening and how to address why young educated talent is leaving, the chamber said in the report.
Business leaders said they also also want more economic development tools and incentives to compete for new-to-market companies and to help employers expand operations.
“From City Hall to the State Capitol to Washington D.C., economic development and workforce policy must be top of mind for our elected officials,” the report said.
Inclusivity to innovation
Among other score card highlights: For inclusivity, the Omaha area’s score reflects several data points that placed it at No. 13 among the 23 metros. An inclusive economy was described as one in which a broad-section of the population participates in prosperity.
While the Omaha area outperformed the nation for its low poverty rate — the U.S. rate reportedly is 31% higher — the area ranked No. 16 among the 23 metros for the poverty rate gap, indicating that the poverty rate is relatively high for the Omaha area’s non-white and Latino populations. 
Also related to inclusivity, the Omaha area ranked 18th of the 23 metros in its educational attainment gap, indicating that education attainment is comparatively low in Omaha for non-whites and Hispanics.

For innovation, which relates to development of new technologies that can spur high-value entrepreneurial ventures, Omaha has sustained the rank of No. 11 for the past two years. The report said the information technology industry makes up 3.4% of the Omaha area’s economy, higher than the national average of 2.9%.
In the “cost of doing business” category, Omaha climbed from No. 17 last year to No. 15. The report said the Omaha metro consistently has lower business costs due to its lower industrial energy costs and wage rates.
The Omaha area’s average wage rate for occupations examined in the report was 13% below the national average. 
Mello said a community effort is needed to tackle weaknesses and harness strengths.
Said the report: “If this Barometer (report) offers a tough diagnosis, it also points us toward our plan for the future.”

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)Interim North Dakota University System Chancellor Brent Sanford says he would be a good fit to continue leading the higher education system despite not coming from a traditional academic background.
State Board of Higher Education Chair Kevin Black plans to recommend on Tuesday that the board skip a national search and hire the former lieutenant governor to lead the university system long term. 
Sanford said in an interview Sunday he plans to accept the job, if offered. He said his background makes him a strong advocate for higher education and an effective leader to respond to workforce needs.
“As the lieutenant governor, and Doug (Burgum) as the governor, we didn’t have the expertise that all the people who work for the state had,” Sanford said. “You’re the administrator, you’re the manager, you’re the one that’s advocating for them to be able to do their job.”
Sanford has worked as interim chancellor since April after serving as interim Bismarck State College president for nearly a semester. Neither interim post had a public search process.
Higher education board chair favors keeping interim leader of North Dakota colleges

One retired university administrator cautions that hiring a permanent chancellor without a national search and without an advanced degree would be “demoralizing” to faculty and campus administrators. 
“It smacks of political cronyism, frankly,” said Daniel Rice, former dean of the University of North Dakota’s College of Education and Human Development and professor emeritus of educational leadership.
Rice, who criticized the board in a recent letter to the editor, said in an interview he’s sure Sanford is a good person but urged the board to conduct an open and competitive search process and shield higher education from political interference.
Sanford was a business owner and mayor of Watford City during the recent oil boom before serving as lieutenant governor for six years. He went on to work on economic development and workforce issues, including consulting for Bismarck State College. Sanford has a bachelor’s degree and is a certified public accountant. 
Most recent North Dakota chancellors have had a doctorate or other advanced degree. It’s been typical for the board to hire a search consultant, advertise the position nationally and appoint a committee to vet applicants. 
Black told a legislative committee last month he didn’t see a need to conduct a national search because it would likely lead the board back to Sanford.
“I think Brent has really a one-of-a-kind skillset, maybe once-in-a-generation skillset to lead our university system,” Black said in an interview last week.
On Tuesday, Sanford is expected to give a presentation to the eight-member board during its meeting at Minot State University before members decide how to proceed.
Black said national search consultants have often cost $100,000 or more, which he said would be “reckless” to spend if the board members believe they already have their top candidate. Conducting a search internally without a consultant would still require significant staff and board member time, Black said.
“I don’t think the cost of that is worth it when I think we’re ultimately going to come right back to where we started,” Black said.
North Dakota University System chancellor accelerates his retirement to April

Rice called it “penny-wise and pound-foolish” to save money on a search for the top person to lead North Dakota’s 11 public colleges and universities.
“It appears to me to be a way of circumventing the search process because he has a personal candidate that he wants to put into the job,” Rice said. 
It would not be unprecedented for the board to hire a chancellor without a search and without an advanced degree.
Retired Chancellor Larry Isaak did not apply to be chancellor but was appointed to the job in 1994 after a new hire backed out.
“I guess I’m an example of someone who didn’t go through a search,” said Isaak, who had been working in the system office at the time. “And I think we had some success during those 10 years.”
When hired, Isaak was working on a master’s degree, which he said he completed within a year of being named chancellor. Isaak recalled that a group of faculty objected to his lack of a doctorate. Years later, one of those faculty members wrote to him and said he was wrong, Isaak said.
The chancellor position has one foot in academia, Isaak said, and one foot in state government, and it’s important for the chancellor to hire good people with expertise in academic affairs, student affairs and other areas.
Sanford said he understands that some would prefer to see a competitive search, but he also points out that he’s had five months of audition for the job.
Former Chancellor Mark Hagerott initially planned to retire at the end of 2025, but announced in April his intent to step down that month. 
The North Dakota Legislature included language in the higher education budget bill indicating the importance of filling the position “in an efficient and timely manner.” The Legislature also required the board to report by Oct. 15 on the status of the search, including the reasons for any delays.
President openings
The presidencies of Bismarck State College and Lake Region State College are also scheduled to be discussed Tuesday, with a closed-door executive session listed on the agenda. Both campuses are led by interim presidents and the presidency jobs have not been advertised.
Black said last week he favors conducting public searches for campus presidents even as he’s advocating to skip a national search for chancellor. With president searches, it’s important to get feedback from alumni, college foundation, faculty, staff, students and local business community, he said.
“It’s a much different thing to hire a president than it is to hire a chancellor,” Black said. “I have a sense that we’ll want to do a search in those but that’s going to be up to the board to discuss.”
Jensen out Jan. 2 as Bismarck State College president

BSC’s interim president is Dan Leingang, who was vice president of academic affairs and briefly served as acting president. Lake Region State College in Devils Lake is led by Carmen Simone, who had been dean and CEO for Dakota College at Bottineau.
Some board members may want to discuss offering Simone the position permanently without a search, Black said, because she has previously led campuses. Simone is former president of Western Nebraska Community College and was a finalist for the Dickinson State University president search in addition to leading the Bottineau campus.
“She has been really vetted by the board, and so that might play into the board’s decision on whether or not to do a search there,” Black said.
The higher education board approved a separation agreement with former BSC President Doug Jensen last December. Former Lake Region President Doug Darling retired at the end of June.
Chancellor versus commissioner
In addition to debating who will lead the North Dakota University System, board members also are weighing a change in title, largely in response to a push from some lawmakers.
The leader of the system has been called chancellor since the early 1990s, but prior to that the post was called commissioner.
Rep. Steve Swiontek, R-Fargo, raised during the recent legislative session that commissioner is the title in the state constitution.
The higher education budget bill directs the board to study “the costs and benefits of a system of higher education led by a chancellor compared to a commissioner.” The board is expected to discuss Tuesday next steps for the study, including holding listening sessions with stakeholders. A report is due in May.
Lawmakers and current and former higher education officials have varying views on the difference between the two titles.
Bottineau college leader to fill in as Lake Region president

Swiontek said he views a commissioner as empowering more authority to college and university presidents.
Black disagreed that a title change would shift more power to presidents because the authority is outlined in board policies, not a job title.
Black indicated that he favors the commissioner title to align with the state constitution. He added he thinks the chancellor title “invokes a perception of a really authoritarian-type role, and maybe a highly academic role, and that’s not what I think this role is.”
Rice, who as a professor and dean worked under both chancellor and commissioner models, said going back to a commissioner system would “be a step backwards.”
“The commissioner system is much more easily subjected to political wrangling and interference than a chancellor system,” Rice said. 
Isaak, who also worked under both models, said reverting to a commissioner model would weaken the position to more of an administrative role.
“It’s a first step for those who want to undo the system and return to every institution for themselves,” Isaak said.
Black disagreed with that criticism and said the board is committed to a cohesive university system. 
“I just fundamentally disagree that there’s some type of shift toward individualism within the campuses,” Black said.

They’ll sleep on couches, on the floor or doubled up with siblings. 
Former House of Delegates member Steve Westfall decided to do something about it. 
He launched a local chapter of Sleep in Heavenly Peace, a national nonprofit organization that uses volunteers to build and deliver handmade beds along with mattresses, bedding and pillows to children in need. The nonprofit’s slogan says, “No kid sleeps on the floor in our town.”
Since Labor Day, Westfall said they’d delivered nine beds to local kids. 
“An 11-year-old told us this was the first bed she has ever had,” said Westfall, who served as a Republican in the House from 2012 to 2024.
He says they’ll deliver 25 beds to children by the end of the month.
“We know there’s a need. We got two more applications today,” he said Sept. 16.

Westfall said he learned about Sleep in Heavenly Peace from a fellow lawmaker, Sen. Ben Queen, R-Harrison, who had built beds in his home county. 
West Virginia has a rising child poverty rate and a foster care crisis — issues Westfall heard about in the Legislature — that have contributed to children needing beds. Sometimes grandparents suddenly take in multiple grandchildren, and they don’t have enough beds or blankets for the children or the means to pay for it.
Westfall worked with fellow Ripley Rotary Club members to get the local chapter up and running.
In Ripley, not far from Westfall’s insurance agency, there’s now a building full of lumber, table saws, sanders and more. Westfall said that grants and local donations helped it come together. 
Westfall traveled to Salt Lake City to learn how to make the beds from Sleep in Heavenly Peace.
Volunteer groups come in on designated weekends to build and assemble single beds and bunk beds. There’s a dipping tank for a mixture of vinegar and steel wool, where sideboards and headboards are treated to repel bed bugs.  
“Ten year olds could do this,” Westfall said. “We had 8-year-olds on the sanders, and we had 80-year-olds on the sanders.”
Finished beds are stacked in a 20 foot storage building next door donated by the local Constellium plant. 
“The community has really been supportive,” Westfall said.
Sheets, blankets and pillows — all donated items — are sorted in bags and labeled by gender and age to be delivered along with the beds and mattresses.

Families can apply for beds through a link shared on Facebook.
“As long as you live in Jackson County, we’ll approve you, ages 3 to 17,” Westfall said. “We deliver them and set them up.”
Westfall said the biggest need at this time is money to purchase mattresses. He also hopes to see more Sleep in Heavenly Peace chapters open in the state. There are currently four chapters of the nonprofit in West Virginia.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)GILBERT, W.Va. — At a public hearing last Thursday for two proposed natural gas plants in Mingo County, resident Pam Surber had a message for regulators from the state Department of Environmental Protection: “We were here first.”
At 63 years old — and turning 64 in two months — Surber said she’s lived in Gilbert for all but five years of her life. Wearing a shirt with a family photo on it featuring her children and grandchildren, Surber told members of the DEP’s Division of Air Quality that she and her neighbors weren’t willing to sacrifice their health for the emission-heavy development proposed by New York-based TransGas.
“I have a 6-year-old granddaughter here; I don’t want this to affect her life. [The developers] are only putting the dollar before our health and our lives in this area,” Surber said. “This is where we grew up, and I don’t want to live anywhere else. But I don’t want this to come in and make everything worse.”
The public hearing was held for residents to share their thoughts on two air quality permits pending before the DEP. If approved, TransGas would be given the greenlight from the state to construct two new methane- and diesel-burning natural gas power plants. Per the near-identical applications, the plants would operate as “microgrids,” powering two new data centers: one at the Twisted Gun Golf Course in Wharncliffe and another near the Mingo-Logan county line at the Harless Industrial Park, in Holden.
Over almost four hours, dozens of residents from throughout Mingo County came to speak and listen in a room at the Larry Joe Harless Community Center on Thursday. The meeting was sprawling; it kicked off with presentations from Joe Kessler, program manager at DEP’s Division of Air Quality, and Jerry Williams, an engineer with the division, on the permitting process and the proposed project before transitioning into a question-and-answer section for residents and, finally, public comments.
About 15 residents spoke throughout the meeting. More spoke up from the crowd, supporting statements made by their neighbors and criticizing the DEP. Most residents asked questions about the project while also voicing their discontent and concern with the proposals. Only one person in attendance — Ernie Sammons, the owner of the Twisted Gun Golf Course who has said he knows he’ll benefit personally from the development through his land’s sale — spoke in support of the project.
Standing at the podium at the front of the room, Wharncliffe resident Bobby May asked people to raise their hands if they were against the project. Immediately, almost every hand went in the air. Some in attendance raised both their hands.
“I feel that in the southern part of West Virginia, that we are very vulnerable. That’s why [TransGas] decided to tackle this area. We do not deserve [to have them] profit over our lives and our health. We do not,” May said. “You guys [at the DEP] have got the power to put the hammer down. You guys are supposed to protect us. That’s who you’re supposed to make decisions for. You guys know what’s right and what’s wrong. And it’s wrong when you’re inflicting cancer and diseases and death on a community … All this is, is corporate greed. That’s all this is over our lives.”










All this is, is corporate greed. That’s all this is over our lives.

Mingo County residents raise their hands in opposition to the proposed natural gas plants during a meeting on Sept. 18, 2025. The state Department of Environmental Protection is considering two air quality permits for two separate methane- and diesel-fueled power plants to be built in the county. (Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)
According to the nearly identical air quality permit applications filed with the DEP, the two natural gas plants would each house 117 engines powered by methane, with 114 of those running full-time. If no gas is available, the engines would run on diesel that is stored in 40 tanks on each site. 
Annually, per the applications, each facility would have the potential to emit up to 206 tons of carbon monoxide, 194 tons of nitrogen oxides, 118 tons of volatile organic compounds and 188 tons of fine particulate matter, or soot. 
These kinds of emissions are known to negatively affect air quality in surrounding areas and contribute to climate change. People at risk of developing respiratory problems — including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, black lung or other illnesses — are particularly vulnerable to negative health impacts from these emissions.
‘We suffer while they profit:’ Residents angry over lack of communication, answers from TransGas and DEP
While the public comment period for the project was extended (it closed at 5 p.m.Friday), the DEP already made a preliminary determination that the air quality permits for the natural gas facilities will be approved. 
Kessler said this is due to the fact that the emissions and plans detailed in the applications meet all federal and state limits. Usually, Kessler said, when that’s the case then the division is “going to issue the permit” no matter other, unrelated concerns.
“[Our job] is to ensure the state is meeting and complying with [state and federal] standards. We’re not the scientists, we’re not the epidemiologists [setting those standards],” Kessler said. “We’re looking at the rules and regulations and writing a permit to stay in compliance with those rules and regulations…”
Throughout the meeting, residents asked question after question that Kessler said was out of the division’s capacity to answer.
They wanted to know how the project will impact their water quality and availability, what kind of noise and light pollution they can expect, how volatile fuel is going to be transported to the sites and what would happen if anything went wrong at the facilities, among other things.
Over and over, Kessler informed them that the division didn’t have answers. Questions about water, he said, could be answered under a separate permitting process through the DEP’s water division.
Other concerns, however, will likely remain unknown as the state has implemented a law that stops localities from enforcing any statutes — like noise, light or zoning ordinances — against microgrids built to power data centers. All but 30% of the taxes collected where the developments are located would be diverted to the state. Meanwhile, residents will bear 100% of the environmental and health impacts they bring.
Tonya Mounts, an attorney and Gilbert resident, asked Kessler and the other regulators, including Division of Air Quality Director Laura Crowder, what residents would need to do to stop the state from approving these applications and allowing the developments to move forward.
“Submit relevant comments pertaining to the air quality,” Kessler said. “But I’m going to be 100% honest with you — our rules don’t allow us to deny a permit for 500, for 1,000 people standing up and saying they don’t want [a project].”
Mounts asked the regulators if they would feel comfortable living within a mile of these plants and their emissions.
Kessler said he lives within a mile of the DOW Chemical plant in Kanawha County. He said he would “not be afraid” of the air quality. 
Crowder said she lives in St. Albans, within a few miles from the John E. Amos Power Plant.
“So yes, I would live there,” Crowder said. “I raised my son there.”
In the front row, Surber shot to her feet.
“But you choose to live there; we didn’t choose this,” she said. “We were here first.”
In the crowd, her neighbors shouted “Amen,” and “Give it to ‘em, Pam.”

When it was her turn to address regulators directly, Surber scanned the crowd looking for one man: Adam Victor, the president and founder of TransGas.
She asked him to stand, or at least raise his hand, if he was in attendance. He was not.
“Everybody look around this room,” Surber said. “He’s not here. He’s never here.”
Surber asked regulators why they trusted Victor to adequately and safely run two large power plants if he can’t even show his face to the residents his project would affect. Kessler said that, if anything did go wrong, Victor and TransGas would be fined.
“Well you can fine him. I would just like to F-I-N-D him,” Surber said. “I don’t trust him. We don’t know anything about what this will do to our community. Everything has been kept hush-hush about this … [TransGas] doesn’t want us to know.”
Demone Morgan asked if the regulators were willing to be held accountable if this project didn’t go as planned. What would they do, he asked, if people were hurt by the emissions that would come from the development or any of the other potential consequences it could bring for their community. Kessler said that if the plants operated out of compliance, there would be fines.
“We’ve been promised a lot of fancy things here,” Morgan said. “They promise us a bag of stars, then they give us a bag of crap.”

For decades, the state’s southern coalfields have been struggling economically and otherwise. 
Once flourishing, the decline of the coal industry over the last several decades has led to few employment opportunities and little economic growth or development. 
And as the economy has shrunk, people’s health has simultaneously suffered. The ramifications from generations of active coal mining, and later fracking, include contaminated water supplies and environmental health hazards for those who live there.
Throughout the coalfields, water systems are crumbling. Broadband infrastructure is lacking. Health care and food deserts persist. Developments that bring steady, safe jobs are few and far between.
And yet, Morgan said, promises are always made from those in power or those looking to benefit from the land or its people that they have a solution to turn things around.
Morgan said he’s heard these promises almost his entire life. The people making them, he said, will downplay the risks, telling residents that everything will be fine and that if they just wait, the promises will come to fruition.
“Well, I’ve never seen these promises come true,” Morgan said after Thursday’s meeting. “Not for internet. Not for water. Not for jobs. Not for nothing. Why would this be any different? They don’t care how we suffer while they profit.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for the Tennessee Lookout)At the very time Tennessee should be bringing to bear its proudest traditions of bipartisan local, state and federal collaboration – our history of elected leaders working “across the aisle” for good outcomes – it appears our state is being disserved at this critical moment.
Instead, we are watching a perversion of that history by Gov. Bill Lee and both our U.S. senators, out of a fear they might displease an extreme president.
When President Donald Trump announced on September. 15, that federal troops would be deployed to the streets of Memphis, the cheerleading by Tennessee’s top three elected officials — Lee and Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty — seemed much more concerned with revealing no trace of daylight between themselves and Trump and the agents of his vengeful regime.
The scene in the Oval Office, rather than showing courage and independence of thought, idid not instill much confidence in good and wise government. Lee always likes to exude control and the appearance of firmness. But both he and Trump seemed a little clueless about what the other would be saying on that morning.
Had they actually discussed how the National Guard is to be deployed? With what directives and clear rules of engagement? Who will be the commander of this multi-agency state-federal force?
And what is the truth about crime in Memphis?
Trump deploys National Guard troops to Memphis for anti-crime task force

Crime statistics maintained over years by Memphis Police Department and the Memphis Shelby Crime Commission show a noticeable decline in the most important numbers for major violent crime. The commission’s report for the second quarter of this year showed a 17.4% drop in violent crime, and a 22% decline in major property crime. And while some local Republican lawmakers are questioning the numbers, there is no reason to believe MPD or the Crime Commission is fudging the numbers.
 Beyond the numbers, what we need most is collaboration, which is not a foreign concept. We have had it before. In the summer of 1979, some six months after taking office, then-Gov. Lamar Alexander created the Greater Memphis Community Governor’s Economic and Jobs Conference. In doing so, Alexander fulfilled a campaign promise to make economic development and an improved quality of life in Memphis a top priority.
The Jobs Conference, as it became known, attracted some 200 racially diverse participants in task forces to specifically address business recruitment, energy needs, public transportation, poverty and education. The initiative also included a task force to improve the city’s image and a nonstarter effort involving local tax reform.
It may not look like it now, but the Jobs Conference had a positive impact on Greater Memphis. For a time, the city did make headway in economic development and helping small and Black-own businesses succeed. But mostly, Alexander’s signature effort for Memphis succeeded in building consensus and collaboration between local leaders and residents and state government that stretched well beyond political partisanship.
 “The most important thing I can do is help raise average family income in Tennessee,” Alexander told The Commercial Appeal in November 1979, on the eve of a massive two-day Jobs Conference gathering. “One in five Tennesseans lives in Shelby County, so more and better jobs there will help raise incomes more than any other activity.”
Alexander was just the second Republican elected governor in Tennessee since 1910. After his election in 1978, the office alternated between Democrats and Republicans largely because all of them governed mostly from the middle and sought to build consensus wherever possible.
It’s unfortunate that these days, Lee is running his administration as a conservative bastion beholden to the political whims of Trump and his senatorial enablers, Blackburn and Hagerty.
Lee has shown time and again where his loyalties lie, and he has shown little interest in collaborating with city and county government leaders. The decision to saturate Memphis with the National Guard is a prime example.
Tennessee governor not ready to deploy troops to Memphis

The governor said in late August that he had no plans to deploy National Guard troops to the Bluff City, citing a reduction in crime over the past year. That obviously rankled the president who has been looking for a blue city in a red state to plant his politically driven tough-on-crime flag.
The following week, Lee backtracked by telling reporters anything is possible on the issue of sending in the troops. Then came last week when the president abruptly announced on Fox News that he is sending the National Guard to Memphis. By then, Lee’s 180-degree turn was complete.
And on Monday at the White House, Lee told Trump and a national TV audience he welcomes the increased federal intervention in Memphis. “I’ve been in office seven years. I’m tired of crime holding the great city of Memphis back,” he said. Lee then said he had spoken earlier that day with the directors of the U.S. Marshal Service, the FBI and with Attorney General Pam Bondi, whose first name Lee misstated.  
But he had not spoken to any degree with local officials, including Mayor Paul Young, who so much as said he was blindsided by the announcement. Plus, Lee never mentions the numerous state gun laws he has signed that have put more weapons on our streets and have been a catalyst for much of our violent crime.
Despite the recent drop, the crime problem in Memphis is real and well known. It’s been a drag on the city for years, even decades. In recent years, the homicide numbers skyrocketed — particularly during the pandemic — before starting to fall over the past two years.
Unfortunately, Memphis has allowed itself to be defined almost solely as an out-of-control, crime-infested city when that narrative is grossly overstated.
And now that the National Guard’s presence appears to be a certainty, what we need is collaboration to determine the best use of those additional resources. Lee deserves credit for significantly increasing the number of state troopers patrolling Memphis from about a dozen to 150. He told WMC-TV anchor Joe Birch on Sept. 16, that the National Guard personnel coming to Memphis will be trained military police officers.
“The way we attack crime in Memphis is about to change and it’s about to change forever,” Lee said.
That can be a positive step if the people involved at the federal, state and local level work collaboratively to make a tangible difference in reducing crime – the same way Lamar Alexander worked nearly half a century ago to improve the economic fortunes of Memphis.
Obviously, we are about to see a historic time of testing for Memphis and for Tennessee’s elected leadership.
We will need all the parties involved now to show proper restraint, good policing and a high level of coordination in exercising the powers of the federal government that are being concentrated here.
Let us all pray for a positive outcome for Memphis and its people.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)LOUISVILLE — Planned Parenthood’s leadership has “no plans” to close its two Kentucky locations following a judge’s ruling that the government can block Medicaid funding to the organization for a year. 
Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of Planned Parenthood’s largest geographic affiliate of health centers that includes Kentucky, told the Lantern Thursday during a sit-down interview in Louisville that the state’s two locations — in Lexington and Louisville — will keep their doors open for now. 
The two centers, which see thousands of Kentuckians every year, will continue offering routine services like mammograms, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease testing, prenatal and postpartum care and more. 
Congress passed a sweeping budget law over the summer that, among other things, banned Medicaid payments to  clinics and providers that offer abortions even for other health care, such as cancer screenings, and family planning services they provide. A judge blocked the ban briefly, but a U.S. Court of Appeals overruled that decision on Sept. 11.

Planned Parenthood leadership, Gibron said, has been preparing for such news since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, removing the constitutional right to abortion and handing states power to create a patchwork of laws. Kentucky immediately banned abortion in most cases. Since then, all lawsuits and bills filed in challenge of the law have failed. 
“What we have been doing, frankly, ever since the fall of Roe, is contingency planning around these scenarios,” Gibron said while visiting the Louisville Health Center last week. “We anticipated a lot of what is happening.” 
For now, she said, Kentucky Medicaid patients will continue to be served for free through September. Slightly more than half (51%) of Kentucky’s Planned Parenthood patients fall below the poverty line and 36% have Medicaid, according to the organization. 
“Our No. 1  priority is protecting our patients’ access to care, so we are doing everything that we can right now to identify the path forward of how we do that,” Gibron said. 
She is turning to donors, hoping to raise funds to fill the gaps, she said. Patients “may have to pay something in the future; that is yet to be determined what that may be,” she said. 
Meanwhile, she believes that “there is no way” the funding blocks will last only one year. 
“Absolutely, we are going to have to raise more money to mitigate that impact of the Medicaid defund,” Gibron said. “We are resilient and resolved. I am fiercely committed to our work and to our patients.” 
‘Lives are at stake.’ 
Jennifer Allen, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates and a policy expert with the organization, told the Kentucky Lantern that funding cuts will have far-reaching fallout, worsening maternal health, birth outcomes, maternity care deserts and more in a state already plagued by barriers to care and poor outcomes.

“Medicaid was created because we had a shared belief in this country that everybody should have coverage for some basic level of health care, including reproductive health care, and we seem to have lost that,” Allen said. “We know that Medicaid never guaranteed access. It only guaranteed at least a minimal level of coverage for folks who could least afford any access to health care.” 
About 1 in 3 Kentuckians are covered by Medicaid, a federal-state program that also saw cuts in the budget bill passed by Congress this year. 
People who have Medicaid coverage, Allen said, “are the folks who already have the worst health outcomes; already may be the sickest, and that’s just going to get worse.” 
The Kentucky General Assembly, she said, needs to “find a way to assure that patients will still have access to care without cost for the lowest income.” 
“We’ve got to figure out how to assure that we have a basic level of expectation of health as a part of basic human rights, as a part of human decency,” Allen said. “Being able to take care of yourself and your family, take care of your body, should be a basic value for all of us. That’s what we need to see. So, donors are wonderful. We love them. We’re so grateful to them, and they care, like we do, about making sure that patients can come in still and get access to care. But it shouldn’t have to be that way.” 
During the interim between legislative sessions, Kentucky lawmakers  have heard several presentations about federal changes to the Medicaid program and details about the budget bill, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. During the 2026 legislative session lawmakers will be tasked with passing a new two-year state budget, which would need to account for funding shifts set in motion by that law. 
Rachel Brown, the area services director for Planned Parenthood who works in Kentucky and other states, said she’s already looking for ways to cut costs and streamline care. Kentucky’s centers see 4,861 patients every year, according to Planned Parenthood data, and more than 8,000 visit the two facilities annually. 
“We don’t know what patients will do when they lose the ability to use their Medicaid here,” Brown said. “I think that patients will still want to come here if they can. The other thing is: There aren’t places to go. The idea that: ‘Take away people’s ability to come to Planned Parenthood and they’ll just go somewhere else’ is a farce. That is not a real thing.” 
Kentucky has had a well-documented health care workforce shortage for years. Researchers have estimated Kentucky could lose 35 hospitals in the funding fallout from the federal budget bill. 
For now: “I want to say really definitively: We have no plans to close our Louisville or Lexington health centers,” Gibron said. “Can I sit here and tell you that will be the case for the next three years of the Trump administration? I honestly don’t know yet, but I’m going to do everything I can to prevent it, because patients’ lives are at stake, and my plan is to not abandon our patients in the way that lawmakers have.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and now Memphis, Tennessee, have been subject to President Donald Trump’s orders deploying National Guard troops to their streets.
Until his announcement last Monday that he’d send in troops and federal law enforcement agents to Memphis with the support of that state’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee, Trump’s focus had been on Democratic strongholds. 
The White House shelved plans to send the guard to Chicago over the objections of Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, after advisors warned it would draw legal challenges. But that didn’t end speculation that other large Democratic-run cities, such as Philadelphia, could be in line for what Trump calls an effort to “restore law and order.”  
“It’s very important because of the crime that’s going on, not only in Memphis, in many cities,” Trump said in the Oval Office when he signed an order to send forces to Tennessee.
Gov. Josh Shapiro and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, both Democrats, have said they plan to fight back with the tools their respective offices provide if the president turns his attention to the commonwealth. 
“It is my hope that it will not get to that here in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro told reporters Wednesday. “I can tell you that we are preparing aggressively on that front.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Krasner said in a series of town hall meetings around the city that he would prosecute federal officials for civil rights violations and encouraged Philadelphians to record any incidents they witness.
The National Guard is unlike other military services in the United States. It exists under dual sovereignty, meaning it is commanded both by the president and the governors of the states where National Guard units are based.
Governors have the authority to deploy their states’ National Guard on missions anywhere in the country for disaster relief, as Shapiro did last winter when heavy snow stranded people in Erie. Guard units under state control can also support civil law enforcement, as in the National Guard’s ongoing mission at the United States-Mexico border.
“I’ve deployed our Guard to the southern border of the United States. I’ve deployed our guard to Germany, where they’ve trained Ukrainian soldiers in trying to push back on Russian aggression,” Shapiro said. 
In that context, the National Guard is functionally a state militia, according to Beau Tremitiere, an attorney with Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to preserving America’s form of government. 
National Guard troops can also be deployed with a governor’s consent under Title 32 of the United States Code, to carry out a federal government mission as in Tennessee.
Without a state governor’s cooperation, the president can federalize National Guard troops under Title 10, which governs the Armed Forces, but their missions are limited to repelling an invasion, putting down rebellion and enforcing federal law.
“I think that it is dangerous when a commander in chief of the United States tries to usurp the power from the commander in chief of the state, it sets up a conflict,” Shapiro added. “And we’ve seen that conflict play out on the streets of Los Angeles as just an example. We are prepared, should the president of the United States seek to try and commandeer our guard and deploy them on the streets of Philadelphia or anywhere in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

National Guard soldiers have been used to enforce federal laws in the past – notably when Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy used troops to enforce desegregation laws. But Lindsay Cohn, a political scientist who studies civilian-military relations, said it is a seldom-exercised power of the presidency. 
“That means there’s very little jurisprudence around it,” Cohn said. “There isn’t really a clear legal path to sending troops into other states for state-level law enforcement.”
If the Trump administration were to call on Republican governors to send guard soldiers to cities like Chicago or Philadelphia, it would be on a highly-dubious legal footing and would violate core constitutional principles, Tremitiere said.
“One state cannot lawfully invade another,” Tremitiere said. “There might be cases when the president could lawfully federalize the guard, even though it’s a bad and dangerous idea. It’s critically different when you’re talking about one state sending forces into another state and actively policing its streets. That’s never OK.”
The Posse Comitatus Act, which stems from the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, forbids federal troops from enforcing state or local laws.
“For the first time in peacetime, in U.S. history, you had a lot of federal personnel, military personnel, being used to try and just manage civilian affairs,” Tremitiere said, adding Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act in 1878 to reinforce the nation’s founding principle that military involvement in civilian government is an inherent threat to liberty.
Under the Insurrection Act, however, the president can temporarily suspend the act. The law’s intent is to allow the federal government to address internal rebellion using the regular Army and National Guard. But critics warn that it’s too vague and leaves too many details to the president’s discretion. 
While the Trump administration has reportedly considered using the Insurrection Act, it’s considered an extraordinary measure, Tremitiere said.
“It’s long been recognized as a red line,” he said. “Either facts on the ground are so awful that we have to resort to this extraordinary remedy, or if the glass is broken short of an actual rebellion, it means that there is a clear abuse of power.”

Trump employed Title 10 to federalize California National Guard troops over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s objection in response to protests over immigration raids in June. A federal judge in San Francisco ruled earlier this month that the deployment was illegal. 
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the civilian police force was able to enforce the law and the use of armed troops to conduct traffic blockades and crowd control violated the Posse Comitatus Act. 
Taken with Trump’s and Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth’s statements they intend to send National Guard troops into other cities, it raises concern the administration was “creating a national police force with the president as its chief,” Breyer’s decision said. The administration is appealing.
In the District of Columbia, Trump initially mobilized the district’s own National Guard in August to respond to what he characterized as a city “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals,” notwithstanding federal Justice Department data showing crime in the city is at a 30-year low. 
Six Republican governors have since agreed to use their Title 32 authority to send their National Guard soldiers to the nation’s capital. Because those troops are technically under state control, the Posse Comitatus Act doesn’t restrict them from law enforcement duties.
In a challenge to Trump’s actions, D.C. leaders have argued the deployment violates the autonomy Congress vested in the city to police itself and determine when to request National Guard aid from other states. They also allege it violates the Posse Comitatus Act because the district’s National Guard reports directly to the president and is always under federal control.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has credited the presence of federal law enforcement — including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the FBI — and their partnership with the Metropolitan Police Department with lowering crime in the city.

At the same time she said the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and National Guard troops “is not working,” citing a break in trust between police and the community. “We know having masked ICE agents in the community has not worked, and National Guards from other states has not been an efficient use of those resources,” she said.
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has endorsed Trump’s suggestion to use the national guard to combat crime in New Orleans, although he has not asked Trump to do it or used his own authority to mobilize the state’s guard.
If the Trump administration were to employ the same tactic in states with Democratic governors, like Pennsylvania, they would have a right to challenge it directly in the U.S. Supreme Court, Jane Bentrott, also an attorney with the Protect Democracy Project, said.
But Tremitiere said Illinois Governor Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Johnson were effective by standing firmly by their convictions that sending troops is unnecessary, unlawful and would not be tolerated.
“Their courage created a real political cost,” Tremitiere said. “All signs suggest their bold stance led to the administration backing down on what appeared to be a pretty clear intention to move forward promptly in Chicago.”
Bentrott said Shapiro has shown similar resolve without picking a fight with Trump.
“So far that seems to be working,” she said. “Not drawing fire while still holding firm that he would oppose the National Guard coming in here.”
More conventional political forces may also shape the Trump administration’s plans as the midterm elections draw closer, Cohn, the political scientist, said. 
“The evidence that we have indicates that the public is not extremely comfortable with militarized law enforcement,” she said. “That is something that at least some of his advisors are going to take into account and worry about.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metroguard-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 05:56:29.643061

Gavin Newsom blasted President Donald Trump for his “relentless, unhinged California obsession” in a Sept. 9 State of the State address.
Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker likened federal immigration enforcement practices to Nazi Germany.
Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called Trump’s threats of immigration raids in Boston a “power grab” and “political theater.”
Here’s Gov. Dan McKee’s sharpest language toward the White House so far: “At a time when we should be moving forward with solutions for energy, jobs and affordability, the Trump administration is choosing delay and disruption.”
The governor’s statement came the day after the Trump administration sent shockwaves across Rhode Island by issuing a stop work order on the Revolution Wind project, already 80% complete and set to begin providing power to Rhode Island and Connecticut late next year.
It’s the same measured tone he’s used throughout his four and a half years as governor. A Cumberland mayor before he was elected lieutenant governor in 2014, ascending to the governor’s office in 2021, McKee, 74, has built his brand around “teamwork” — an homage to his time as a youth basketball coach — that features cooperation with municipal and business leaders, some of whom might not identify as Democrats.
Facing low polling numbers  — he’s at the bottom of the heap among state governors —  McKee is now being cast as too weak, too slow and too deferential to Trump by opinion writers, social media spectators and his potential rivals in the 2026 gubernatorial primary. Do their claims have merit?
Not necessarily, said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist and director of the Taubman Institute for American Politics and Policy at Brown University. While McKee’s critics see his lack of verbal attacks against the Trump administration as a sign of weakness, Schiller views it as a strategic move.
“We have a very big bridge to fix,” Schiller said, referring to the demolition and rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge, which relies on millions of dollars in federal funding. “I think he was worried about putting that money at risk, and in some ways, rightly so, because Trump has shown he goes after people who criticize him.”
Avoiding bombastic language could help keep Rhode Island off Trump’s radar, in turn preserving the critical bridge funding along with other federal support, Schiller said.
“He took the cautious route,” Schiller said of McKee. “I am not sure that he should be criticized for that.”
McKee doesn’t see his approach as cautious at all, though.
“I speak out against Trump all the time,” the governor said in an interview. “My actions show that.”

Actions not words 
McKee points to his comments about slashed federal education funding and the halt to the Revolution Wind project as examples of his verbal condemnation of Trump’s policies. 
More important to McKee are his actions, like ensuring Rhode Island residents of all ages can receive COVID-19 boosters, with insurance coverage, despite more restrictive federal guidelines and educating Interior Secretary Doug Burgum on exactly how much progress Revolution Wind has already achieved. McKee pointed out that his office organized the Monday morning press conference at Quonset Point — less than 72 hours after the Revolution Wind project was put on hold — bringing together labor leaders, Rhode Island’s congressional delegation and local workers to put the spotlight on the economic consequences of Trump’s actions.
“I’ve made it very clear to everybody that wants to listen, this is a very direct hit on our economy, a direct hit on people’s pocketbooks,” McKee said. “I consider that strong language.”
McKee insisted he heard “no difference” between his responses to the federal administration and the words used by Newsom, Healey and Pritzker.










I speak out against Trump all the time. My actions show that.


– Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee


But it’s not fair to compare McKee to more outspoken Democratic governors. Some states have more to lose under federal actions, and some leaders have more to gain by publicly bashing Trump, said Adam Myers, an associate professor at political science at Providence College.
“Rhode Island is a very small state,” Myers said. “McKee doesn’t have the same political platform that some of these other governors do. And my sense is that he doesn’t have national political aspirations.”
Myers observed McKee turning up the temperature “a little bit” after work on the Revolution Wind stopped, which makes sense given the stakes for state jobs, energy prices and environmental mandates.
“This is something that has major economic ramifications and energy ramifications for Rhode Island,” Myers said. “It’s not just a garden variety culture war.”
Versus, for example, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s written warning to McKee to reverse the state’s “sanctuary” immigration policies. McKee never responded to Bondi’s letter.
“It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to alienate the Trump administration at this point,” Myers said. “The ball is in the federal administration’s court. Exactly what leverage does Rhode Island have?”
Yet trying to keep a vindictive national leader happy might sour some Rhode Island voters on McKee in next year’s gubernatorial race, especially if they have the choice of a candidate with more vocal denouncement of Trump.
An eye on 2026
Public polling suggests six in 10 Rhode Island voters don’t approve of Trump or his administration’s actions; nearly two-thirds of 2024 voters think the country is facing a constitutional crisis, including 27% of Republicans, according to a June survey from the Pell Center at Salve Regina University.
“Democrats are hungry to make a statement to do something, because they’re so distressed about Trump,” Schiller said. “There’s no question, Trump will be the No. 1 issue in the 2026 elections, along with the economy.”
McKee’s known and potential election rivals are already trying to distinguish themselves as more ready and able to take on Trump.

Helena Buonnano Foulkes, 61, who became the second official candidate to declare her intent to run in the 2026 gubernatorial primary, took clear aim at Trump in her campaign kickoff speech.
“Here’s my message to Donald Trump: We will not tolerate your reckless agenda,” said Foulkes, eliciting the loudest, most raucous set of audience cheers of the Sept. 9 event.
In a one-on-one interview the same day, Foulkes criticized McKee’s public stance — or lack of — on federal actions.
“When I look at the Democratic governors, I don’t think Gov. Dan McKee has been at all on the front lines,” Foulkes said. “My biggest criticism is that he is not planning ahead for Rhode Islanders.”










It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to alienate the Trump administration at this point.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who is term-limited, has not confirmed his intent to challenge McKee in the September gubernatorial primary. But he hasn’t ruled it out either.

Neronha, 61, used his platform as the state’s top prosecutor to go hard against Trump, in the courts — part of 34 multi-state lawsuits as of Sept. 4 — and in the public eye.
Despite Schiller’s suggestion that the president might punish those who attack him, Neronha said he has never hesitated or held back — in legal complaints, or verbal rebukes.
“I think you have to stand up to bullies,” Neronha said. 
Already at odds with McKee for years for a series of perceived offenses by both sides, Neronha called McKee’s response to the Trump administration “a little anemic.” 
“The governor may think, you don’t want to poke the bear, but the bear is coming for you,” Neronha said. “You can’t reason with a bear that’s as hungry as Donald Trump.”
McKee brushed off the criticisms by Foulkes and Neronha as “politics as usual.”
“You’ve got a candidate and a potential candidate for my job,” he said.  “I am not surprised.”
That answer might not fly with voters as the campaign heats up. 
“Someone like Foulkes who is not in office has the advantage of riding the wave,” Schiller said. “If McKee was smart, he’ll match her energy as much as he can.”
Labor love 
And while McKee struggles to climb out from persistently low approval ratings — 25% to 29% of voters think he’s doing a good job, according to recent polls — he’s still got the backing of one of the most important influential groups in Rhode Island politics: labor. Union organizers, including Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley, stood shoulder to shoulder with McKee during the Aug. 25 press conference at Quonset Point to address the labor impact of the Revolution Wind project.
“I think he came out pretty vociferously on the offshore wind stuff,” Crowley said of McKee. “I didn’t see any lack of vigor.”
The AFL-CIO endorsed McKee in the four-way 2022 Democratic gubernatorial primary, which also featured Foulkes. The organization has not decided who it will support in the 2026 gubernatorial race — it’s too early, Crowley said. 
Labor organizers are looking closely at the fate of Rhode Island’s only major offshore wind project — and who leads the charge.
“Officials at nearly every level of government are saying the right things, but the real question is, ‘what do we do next?” Crowley said. “We just want the jobs back, and we want the project back up and running.”

The line will run 8.5 miles from northern Jackson County through southern Madison County. (Photo by Whitney McKnight/The Edge)RICHMOND — A judge has granted a protective order to an electric utility that sought to prevent the public from seeing a trove of documents requested for review by Berea College. 
Madison Circuit Judge Kristin Clouse heard arguments from the two sides last week before deciding that the Winchester-based East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC) should have the right to protect information about the locations of certain substations and transmission lines, their capacities, the annual load on the substation currently serving the Big Hill region, and other details about how the substation fits into the power grid. 
Clouse did not grant protection for other questions such as what steps the utility is taking to protect the view shed at the college’s Windswept property and whether and when there will be an environmental assessment pursuant to federal law.
The documents had been requested by the college in a discovery motion as the two entities battle over whether EKPC has the right to take about a mile of the college’s forest land to build the 8.5 mile long transmission line. The power co-op  filed a condemnation suit against the college earlier this year.
The college fears that the line will mar the Pinnacles’ viewshed, among other concerns. The Pinnacles is a popular destination for hikers who can traverse a network of trails in the Berea College Forest. 
The college’s legal team has said the ultimate goal is for EKPC to demonstrate conclusively that the transmission line is necessary. The 69 kilovolt Big Hill Line does not meet the state Public Service Commission’s threshold of 138 kilovolts for EKPC to be required to file for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the PSC.
The utility has maintained throughout that the line is necessary to provide reliable power service to the electric co-op members in the region. 
The judge today also granted permission to Ryan Turner, the lawyer for multiple other parties who own property that will be impacted by the transmission line’s construction, to file a motion that the utility must prove it has demonstrated need before it can claim right of way to his clients’ respective properties. The motion will be held in abeyance until after a ruling comes down in the case between the college and EKPC. 
Clouse instructed EKPC to redraft its motion for a protective order to reflect the pared down number of items she granted. All parties, including Turner, were instructed to return to Clouse’s court on Oct. 16 when she will decide on any further actions. 
Meanwhile, EKPC is expected to share all requested documents with Berea College, as part of the discovery phase of the litigation. Berea College is expected to keep the documents confidential. Clouse agreed with the college that if during the document review, the college finds documents it wishes to make public, or if it is discovered that any of the information has already been made public, she would entertain another motion to remove the protective order on a case by case basis. 
Although the college suggested to Clouse that discovery might extend the time for a hearing until next April, the judge said that was too long for a trial such as this, where the line is already in construction. She recommended a hearing on whether EKPC has the right to take the requested parcel of the college’s forest land, be held no later than this coming January.

(Photos by Alexander Castro and Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current; collage by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s congressional delegation is curious about how nationwide staffing cuts at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are affecting VA workers in the Ocean State.
In a Sept. 16 letter collectively penned by U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo, Rhode Island’s all-Democratic delegation asked Veterans Affairs Secretary Douglas Collins to explain recent department data that shows the department has lost thousands of employees this year. 
“VA employees are essential to serving our Veterans,” the delegates wrote. “The alarming rate at which employees are leaving VA jeopardizes Veterans’ ability to timely access services and benefits they have earned and will undermine the VA’s ability to meet its mission for many years.”
The delegates cited the July 25 issue of the VA’s workforce dashboard, which they say shows the loss of more than 8,700 employees who worked with veterans in the current fiscal year, including 2,129 registered nurses, 751 physicians, 1,283 medical support assistants, and 1,294 claims examiners. 
The dashboard also shows that the VA’s year-over-year hiring pipeline is down in all categories, with the amount of job postings, applications and new hires lower this year than at the same time last year. The Veterans Health Administration reported 13,403 fewer employees across all categories than it had at the start of this fiscal year.
The letter asks for a facility-by-facility breakdown of employee departures in Rhode Island since Jan. 1, as well as data on canceled or rescheduled appointments tied to staffing shortages, plus a list of current job vacancies. 
The delegates want data for Eagle Square VA Clinic, Eagle Street VA Clinic, Providence VA Medical Center, Middletown VA Clinic, Providence VA Regional Benefit Office, and the Providence Vet Center. They asked for occupational details on each departure such as reasons for leaving the VA, years of employment with the VA, and whether the employee resigned or was terminated.
The letter asks Collins to respond by Sept. 30.
Pete Kasperowicz, Press secretary for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said in an email Friday that the department would respond directly to the delegation’s letter.
The VA previously announced on Aug. 6 that it was immediately nullifying collective bargaining agreements for VA workers, including those associated with the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees, National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United, and the Service Employees International Union. 
The department terminated the contracts to comply with a March 27 executive order from President Donald Trump, which excludes parts of the VA, plus other agencies, from the federal labor management statute that allowed for collective bargaining. In 2024, over 1,900 VA employees who were part of bargaining units spent “more than 750,000 hours of work on taxpayer funded union time — including some who are paid more than $200,000 a year,” according to the VA’s news release.
“With no collective bargaining obligations, those hours can now be used to serve Veterans instead of union bosses,” the release reads.
An estimate of the number of employees affected ranges from 350,000 to 400,000 people. 
Rhode Island’s congressional delegates had a different interpretation. 
“Your recent decision to terminate collective bargaining agreements for VA employees will almost certainly make the problem worse, as approximately 80% of VA employees belonged to a union,” they wrote Collins.

Andy Barr. The three spoke at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic on Saturday, Aug 2, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)At Fancy Farm this summer, Kentucky Republicans were treated to a Senate primary that looked less like a policy debate and more like a contest over style.
Daniel Cameron, Andy Barr and Nate Morris all arrived ready to prove their loyalty to Donald Trump. The question was not whether they support him, but what version of Trump-alignment they could sell to voters in Mitch McConnell’s backyard.
The contrasts were striking. Barr, the Lexington congressman with more than $6 million on hand in July, leaned on the tried-and-true playbook: signs, T-shirts, handshakes, and relentless retail politics.
Cameron, still recalibrating after his 2023 governor’s race loss, presented himself as more laid-back and approachable, conceding he was not the money leader. Reporters noticed a new ease and humor on the trail. 
Morris, by contrast, rolled in with theater. He climbed out of a garbage truck labeled “Nate’s DC Swamp Cleanup Services,” pledged to “trash McConnell’s legacy,” and reveled in the attention. 
That spectacle underscored Kentucky’s unusual political puzzle. This is not Wyoming in 2022, where Trump’s endorsement of Harriet Hageman turned Liz Cheney’s reelection into a referendum on loyalty and ended her career. Nor is it Alaska in 2022, where Lisa Murkowski, an outspoken Trump critic, survived thanks to incumbency and ranked-choice voting. And it is not South Dakota, where John Thune brushed off Trump’s pressure and cruised to reelection in 2022. 
Kentucky’s primary is different because all three Republicans can credibly claim Trump ties. Cameron was endorsed by him in 2023. Barr has never broken with Trump and emphasizes his competence and conservative record. Morris embodies the “drain the swamp” outsider persona, launching his bid on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast and lashing out at McConnell directly. 
Here lies the rub: Kentuckians like Trump, but they also like McConnell. Trump carried the state by roughly 30 points in 2016, 26 points in 2020, and by an even larger margin in 2024, particularly in rural counties. 
At the same time, McConnell’s long tenure has brought prestige and power that many voters respect. Yet nationally, he and Trump were sometimes at odds. After the 2020 election, McConnell privately called Trump “stupid” and “despicable,” according to book excerpts reported by the Associated Press.

Still, McConnell has faced consistently low approval ratings in recent years. Morning Consult polling in 2023 and 2024 repeatedly ranked him as one of the least popular senators in the country. But those numbers have not stopped Republican primary voters in Kentucky from supporting him every six years for nearly four decades, underscoring his resilience at home. Morris’ team must believe their strategy can tap into that unpopularity — either because internal polling suggests an opening or because they think securing Trump’s endorsement would override traditional loyalties.
That contradiction shapes the candidates’ strategies.

Barr is offering Trump-friendly competence with establishment credibility. His advantage is resources and relationships, but he risks being cast as too conventional.
Cameron is running as Trump-aligned but approachable, presenting himself as a neighborly conservative. His challenge is fundraising; charm only goes so far without money to amplify it.
Morris is wagering everything on confrontation, arguing you cannot be pro-Trump while celebrating McConnell, and dramatizing that stance in the senator’s own state. It is a high-risk, high-reward bet.

So what should Kentucky voters make of this? Trump’s dominance inside the Republican Party is no longer in doubt. What remains unsettled is how candidates interpret that dominance in a state that has also long valued McConnell’s clout. In Wyoming, Trump picked a side and the base followed. In Alaska, institutional loyalty saved an anti-Trump incumbent. In South Dakota, seniority and money blunted Trump’s ire.
Kentucky could offer a new model: a contest among three flavors of Trump-alignment — Barr’s establishment competence, Cameron’s neighborly conservatism and Morris’s anti-establishment disruption — playing out in a state that has voted red in every presidential election since 2000 and still tips its hat to McConnell’s influence. 
But another unanswered question looms: if all three are already devoted Trump loyalists, why would Trump even intervene?
If Barr or Cameron prevails, it will suggest Kentucky Republicans are comfortable straddling both camps, embracing Trump without disowning McConnell. If Morris breaks through, it will show that the only way to prove loyalty to Trump is to reject the old order entirely, even when that order is homegrown.
Either way, this primary is not about whether the GOP belongs to Trump. That question has been settled. What is at stake is who gets to define what being Trump-aligned actually looks like in McConnell’s Kentucky, and whether voters believe those two legacies can still coexist under the same red hat.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-09-22 09:23:19+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,"Philadelphia DA Krasner talks National Guard, ICE, and Trump during series of town halls",John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/philadelphia-da-krasner-talks-national-guard-ice-and-trump-during-series-of-town-halls/,Some attendees pushing back on Krasner’s rhetoric and focus.,"Members of the National Guard stationed outside Union Station in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Since being sworn in for a second term, President Donald Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington D.C., and more are on their way to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of what he said is an effort to restore law and order.
In recent weeks, Gov. Josh Shapiro has faced questions about how Pennsylvania would respond if the president turned his attention to Philadelphia.
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has been outspoken on the issue. His office held three public events last week to provide advice for what citizens should do, while also sharply criticizing the president’s approach.
“We are here because all over the city are people who do not want an invasion,” Krasner, a Democrat, said at Tuesday night’s event at Salt & Light Church in southwest Philadelphia.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The events were billed as the “Be the Light and Bring the Light” town halls, taking place on three straight nights in different neighborhoods in Philadelphia. Each event ended with Krasner responding to some of the questions submitted via card by audience members.
Krasner said that Trump’s claims of crime being out of control in several big cities, like Philadelphia, were off base. He said he believes there is a different reason.
“This is entirely and specifically an effort to make it normal to have the military in cities, in my opinion, it is entirely and specifically to legitimize more military action later,” Krasner said at Thursday evening’s event at Mother Bethel AME Church in Society Hill.
He told those in attendance, however, that they are not powerless and what they could do to ensure Trump would “leave Philadelphia alone.”
“Get your phone, get your camera, carry it with you. If there are things that you find inappropriate, disturbing, upsetting, whether it’s ICE activity tomorrow or its National Guard, paramilitary, military invasion later: Get the phones up, get that out on social media,” he said. “The fact is, with a million sets of eyes, there’s a whole lot of stuff some people would like to do that’s not gonna get done. And if what they do is a crime, let me see it.”
Krasner said his office would be able to determine if the activity by those in law enforcement from those videos is legal or not legal and would respond appropriately and prosecute them.
He said he believes that public pushback can deter Trump from deciding to send the National Guard to cities like Philadelphia. He cited the president’s recent threat to deploy the guard to Chicago, but ultimately decided against it.

Kate Shaw, a constitutional law scholar and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, joined Krasner for the fireside chat on Tuesday.
Shaw cited the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 as proof that the president does not have the authority to deploy the National Guard domestically. She also noted that a federal judge in California ruled that Trump’s decision to send the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests violated federal law.
“But the bottom line is, it says you can’t send the military in to do civilian peacekeeping,” Krasner said. “The military is for wars. The military is for the enemy. The military is not for us. That’s not what it is, and that has been the law since the Civil War era.”
Philadelphia City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier was the only member of the council to deliver remarks at any of the three events.
“President Trump is trampling over the Constitution and invading cities under the pretext of safety,” Gauthier said. “But tanks rolling down 52nd Street don’t make us safe.”
“Real safety comes from trust between the community and law enforcement,” she added. “It comes from neighbors looking out for each other and from police officers rooted in their communities who are trained as guardians, not to hunt down and kill the enemy.”
Danielle Shaw’s 23-year old daughter was shot and killed in Philadelphia in 2018. She said that she doesn’t believe sending in the National Guard would help combat crime in the city.
“We don’t need the National Guard,” Shaw said. “We need our community. We need our grassroots groups. We need our police department. We need our police department, we need our detectives, we need our lawyers, we don’t need the National Guard.”
Pushback from attendees
Krasner was direct in his criticism of Trump over the three days. During that time, he referred to the president as a wanna-be dictator, a racist, evil, and someone who would like to be king.
“Is the question, will the Pennsylvania legislature and its MAGA members be stupid? Because the answer is, “Yeah,” Krasner said. “I mean, fascist gonna be fascist.”
“These people don’t believe in equality at all. They don’t believe in racial equality. They don’t believe in gender equality. They’re absolutely just as hateful toward women as they are on the issue of race, ” Krasner added. “These are people who agree with Adolf Hitler when he said that equality is a quote ‘degenerate notion,’ unquote.”
Frank Scales, who lives in South Philadelphia, rose to his feet to push back on Krasner’s comments and stated that the district attorney was demonizing Republicans and Trump, and that rhetoric led to the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The motives of Kirk’s alleged shooter remain unclear, although NBC News reported on Saturday that so far “there is no evidence connecting the suspect with any left-wing groups,” and that “every indication so far is that this was one guy who did one really bad thing because he found Kirk’s ideology personally offensive.”
The Associated Press reports he may have been “radicalized” online.
“There is free speech and then there is an effort to stop free speech and what is happening here is the usual right wing effort to silence people who are trying to organize to preserve civil rights,” Krasner responded. “I think the death of Charlie Kirk was awful. I will never justify the murder of another human being.”
Scales left during the second panel discussion and spoke with media members, outside of the church. He said he didn’t plan to challenge Krasner, but called the event a “publicity stunt” when he realized that audience members couldn’t directly ask questions.
Following the event, Krasner told reporters that the use of the word fascist and comparisons to Hilter were “100% necessary” in a time like this, noting his family’s history of military service during World War II.
“It is absolutely necessary to recognize the times we are in to not be appeasers, to not stand by, to not let people take over everything that I believe in and that the city believes in,” Krasner said. “We believe in equality. We believe in freedom. We believe in safety. They don’t believe in any of those things at all. Other people may want to say that Mr. Hitler has a nice mustache. I don’t think so.”
Scales said he supports the National Guard being deployed to Philadelphia, noting that the police department is currently short of the amount of officers they need to have.
“We need dialogue,” Scales said. “So, if Krasner disagrees with Trump, he should say that in good faith, not demonize and call him a fascist. He’s pulling the wool over people’s eyes.”
He is also a founder of Surge Philly, a group that says its mission is to take back Philadelphia by “exposing liberal bias, gut-punching big government, and unleashing free markets.”
In the final moments of Thursday evening’s event, another attendee voiced her displeasure with Krasner.
Judy Robinson said that prevention was key for combating crime in the city.
“I’m in the 22nd District where murder and mayhem is out of control,” she said.
Robinson said that children “are being given guns like crack,” and that she isn’t worried about the National Guard or Donald Trump, but is instead concerned about what can be done to combat crime in her local community. She said she wants the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to help address the matter.

ICE also on the minds of Philadelphians
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations was also a topic brought up on several occasions throughout the three-day stretch, with it being a more prominent focus at the event at the Grace Baptist Church of Germantown last Wednesday evening.
“We are specifically protected from federal officials trying to force local officials to enforce their law,” Krasner said. “Frankly, I’d much rather be catching people for homicide than running around catching hardworking kitchen workers who are undocumented.”

“So that I’m clear with you, if somebody comes here and they murder two people, and there’s an interest in deporting them, I’m fine with that, after they finish their sentence. That’s ok with me,” Krasner said. “I am, personally, very much against going after people who are hardworking, who are supporting their families, who are fundamentally law abiding.”
Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal was on hand to explain what her office does, while also fielding a few questions.
“The sheriff’s office does not cooperate with ICE,” she said.
Bilal explained that ICE has an agreement with her office that, among other things, says the agency has to have a valid warrant and cannot come inside the courthouse to arrest anyone.
On the final night, Krasner said the turnout over the three nights had shown him that similar meetings should be held in different parts of the city in the future.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nationalguard-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 05:56:29.643061

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)There are 169 new affordable homes coming to the greater Richmond area, developers and officials announced last week, following various state and local awards. A recent $1.2 million investment from PlanRVA and the Partnership for Housing Affordability are supporting nine projects — both homes and apartments — that residents who earn 30% to 80% of the area median income can move into. 
Area median income in RIchmond, for example, equals a household salary of about $63,000. This means that people living on nearly $19,000 to about $50,000 per year could qualify as tenants of the new residences in Richmond. Goochland County and Hanover County both have an AMI of about $118,000 while Henrico’s is about $84,000, Chesterfield’s is $101,000, and Powhatan’s is $110,000. 
The funds stemmed from Virginia Housing and were disbursed to organizations like project:HOMES, the Maggie Walker Land Trust, Commonwealth Catholic Charities and various local chapters of Habitat for Humanity throughout Richmond and surrounding counties. 
One of the larger developments is an 83-unit senior citizen apartment complex on Bainbridge Street in Richmond’s Swansboro neighborhood. Matt Morgan with project:HOMES said the location was ideal because it’s near bus stops and presented an opportunity to create infill development on what was once an abandoned building. 
Where a parapet-topped building featuring some apartments with balconies now rises once stood a derelict train servicing station and coal-dumping facility. The crumbling-brick and foliage-covered structure was razed to make way for the new residential space, but part of the building has been preserved and will be the community center – open both to the building’s tenants and neighbors in the area.

While 169 units is relatively small compared to the hundreds of thousands living in the region, it’s169 more individuals or families who will be able to be sheltered as the state and various organizations work to open up more pathways to affordable housing.
Around 30% of residents in Richmond and surrounding counties are cost-burdened, meaning they spend 30% or more of their income on housing, while about 13% of area residents are more severely burdened,  spending 50% or more of their income on housing. 
In Richmond, several neighborhoods have seen new housing construction in recent years, but much of that has been market-rate. The new projects coming online through the housing-focused nonprofits means there will be 169 more opportunities for those in need. 
Members of the various nonprofits joined The Mercury for a tour of the Bainbridge Street development recently to discuss bolstering partnerships with each other and ways state and local governments can keep supporting their work. 
Morgan said that interest rates jumped when project:HOMES was beginning work on the apartments. But when Richmond released a performance grant, it absorbed the interest rate. 
“That meant dollars and cents to the project, so that actually saved this deal,” he said. 
As Richmond is undergoing a local code refresh, PHA director Jovan Burton emphasized how that can help developers create more infill and more dense development in areas. 
An often hyper-local issue, some state lawmakers have worked to help support localities that are trying to address affordability issues. It’s not always easy, however, when tensions between local and state governments emerge. 
A Dillon Rule state, local governments have authority over things like local land use and zoning decisions. State lawmakers have worked on policies that can create flexibility for localities or instances where the state could step in. The ideas don’t always get across the finish line.
But some proposals have passed and been implemented. Now-Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond passed a bill while in the Virginia General Assembly to encourage infill development. More recently a proposal to allow faith-based organizations to build housing on land they already own has been mirrored in a federal proposal. Both have yet to pass, but could prove helpful if they do. 
“It would always be great to have more resources at the state level to support housing, to pair and leverage local dollars,” Burton said.

(Photos by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Workforce development and education leaders said during a Friday summit that Virginia needs to shake things up to continue meeting the surging health care workforce demand across the commonwealth, while also making it easier for educational institutions to offer programs that diverge from the traditional college preparation route. 
According to a study by George Mason University’s Center for Health Workforce, Virginia needs more than 17,000 registered nurses and 10,000 medical and human services managers.
Kathleen deLaski, the author of “Who Needs College Anymore?” recommended the “step-ladder” approach to higher education as a method to consider moving into the future during Claude Moore’s annual health care workforce summit in Richmond.
“We need a step ladder approach to college,” deLaski said. “Rather than being afraid or concerned that they’re going to go out of business if they add products or services besides four-year degrees or two-year degrees, (colleges) should embrace the array of offerings that they could be providing for all. Not just the elite or the middle class, but all types of learners.”
deLaski said she did not write her book to discourage people from going to college, but rather to serve as a “wake-up call” for higher education, noting that 60% of Americans do not complete college. 
She noted that the country’s policy system favors funding four-year institutions over short-term and workforce development programs.
However, recent federal reform efforts are expanding Pell Grants to workforce training programs, changes that could begin as early as next summer. Another reform measure for colleges and universities: the government will verify whether graduates are actually earning a decent income afterward. The U.S. Department of Education extended the reporting deadline to Sept. 30. 
Panelists, including Virginia Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera, Virginia Community College System Chancellor David Doré, and Lesa Hanlin, executive director of strategic initiatives and corporate relations at the University of Virginia, discussed some of the barriers and possible solutions, including challenging what has become the norm in education.

Guidera said one way Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration proposed a new method was successfully encouraging the General Assembly to back and fund the establishment of the laboratory schools, which are developed and operated in partnership with colleges and universities and designed to offer students tuition-free specialized instruction for high-demand careers like teaching, computer science and technology. Legislation to establish lab schools in Virginia first passed in 2012 under former Gov. Bob McDonnell. 
“Lab schools are basically what people are doing every single day, which is connecting the dots, bringing people together saying ‘how can we invest in people so they are ready for the jobs in healthcare,” Guidera said, adding that she hopes funding will continue with the next administration.
“Lab schools, apprenticeships, internships, partnerships — this is what’s critical to get over the inertia of ‘keep doing education’ and saying what we’ve always been doing because it’s not working what we have been doing, and this is the future,” Guidera added. 
Former Del. Kathy Bryon, who was one of the panelists, carried a few pieces of successful legislation around workforce development including one to create the state’s FastForward, a short-term career credential training program, and another measure that led to the development of the Department of Workforce Development and Advancement, or Virginia Works, to centralize oversight of workforce development programs and data systems.
Byron, now a deputy commissioner with Virginia Works, said employers are telling the team that a college degree by itself is no longer the right indicator of readiness. 
“What matters is the skills they bring, the competences they bring, the experiences that they bring on the job,” Byron said.
Panelists also shared a consistent theme of changing the narrative to ensure all Virginians — from students to parents, veterans, to new career seekers — understand that entities, including the Virginia Community College System, are here to support them.
The event attracted more than 100 stakeholders from school systems and businesses around Virginia.

Bill Hazel, CEO of Claude Moore Opportunities and former Virginia Secretary of Health, said in a statement that the event was an “amazing gathering” of people focused on creating “family sustaining career opportunities” while meeting the state’s health care needs.
“There are rewarding and critically needed positions waiting to be filled throughout the healthcare system, but too often people don’t know how to get the training and credentials they need, or face barriers that keep them out of the healthcare workforce,” Hazel said. “When we invest in flexible, accessible career pathways in healthcare, we lift more Virginians into the middle class and help our fellow Virginians live healthier lives.”

(Photo by Janie Segui Rodriguez/Stop the Wait)The drove of parents in yellow T-shirts who trooped up the stairs in Providence’s City Hall to the City Council chambers on July 24 hoped they were heading for the grand finale of months of advocacy for a desirable new school. Their T-shirts were emblazoned with Stop the Wait, a nonprofit that helps parents understand their rights and champions public school options so children from low-income families aren’t trapped in schools they don’t like. 
That night the City Council was ready to vote on a proposal to lease the vacant Carl Lauro Elementary School building on Kenyon Street to Excel Academy for 35 years. The deal included $80 million for a full renovation on Excel’s dime, as well as lush ancillary benefits to Providence’s district schools, families, the city, and the neighborhood surrounding an abandoned eyesore residents had put up with for two years. The cost to the city for maintenance and security of the vacant school: $300,000 a year.
Stop the Wait registered each on-the-ground advocate. CEO Janie Sequi Roderiquez said 419 parents made thousands of phone calls and knocked on thousands of doors to solicit support. 
While the parents and nonprofit advocates worked, City Council President Rachel Miller negotiated the lease with Mayor Brett Smiley and Excel staff. A July 17 council newsletter outlined the details of the deal that had been carefully vetted with public meetings and a feasibility study. 
But the parents knew there could be trouble. Because 24 hours earlier, Miller did a whiplash 180 and insisted the council vote against it. 
Despite a new sound system, the council chamber’s acoustics are so bad, participants strain to hear and be heard. 
When the vote took place, a triumphal whoop went up. Some families joined the clapping and hugging to celebrate what they assumed was a victory for their kids. 
It was not. 
The lease died on an 8-4 vote. The applause actually originated with Providence Public School District (PPSD) teachers, dressed in familiar blue T-shirts, who show up at education-related public meetings. As translations and corrections circulated, parents were shocked to learn the teachers weren’t with them after all. A dark sense of betrayal replaced their initial confusion. Tears broke out.

The parents learned the hard way that the lease had little to do with serving the public or shepherding scarce resources. It was about protecting union jobs by vilifying charters with sentiments verging on hatred. Charters are public schools — publicly accountable, publicly supported, though underfunded compared with district schools — that are not necessarily unionized. 
Political dignitaries conduct silly “listening tours” but won’t hear the hard data screaming from the charter waiting lists where thousands of families languish. Parents of all economic classes want public charter seats because they’d prefer diverse, effective, taxpayer-funded public schools. Excel will open eventually as soon as it finds a private building that will come off the city’s tax rolls, unlike the disused Carl Lauro building.
You’d think the council would be salivating at the $80 million. Last November, the city lost a $15 million lawsuit brought by the Department of Education for underfunding what the state deemed its share of the per pupil expenditure. This unbudgeted expense forced the city to ask the General Assembly to let it override the 4% cap on raising the city’s total tax levy, per state law. City residents and businesses were outraged. 










As translations and corrections circulated, parents were shocked to learn the teachers weren’t with them after all. A dark sense of betrayal replaced their initial confusion. Tears broke out.


And lest the taxpayers of greater Rhode Island feel they have no stake in Providence school problems, actually they pay almost half of Providence’s per pupil expenditure and their taxes reimburse 80% of school capital expenditures. The lack of a Lauro School lease is now a state problem. 
In a July 23 council newsletter, Miller stated: “The city council will not hand the keys of a shuttered public school building to a charter school.”
Up until 24 hours earlier, the only organization that didn’t like the deal was the teachers union, a private-sector business which, like all unions, exists to benefit clients and not the public mission those clients are supposed to serve. 
A teacher’s July 21st Facebook post reads: “We did it guys! It didnt (sic) pass and public school teachers showed up. Excellent Video. We must remain steadfast! … Bravo to ALL who have supported PUBLIC schools that serve ALL students (unlike charter schools)” – which is not only not true, but illegal by state law.
The “excellent video” shows Councilor Miguel Sanchez and school board member Cory Jones malign charters in a stream of misinformation and flat-out lies that would take an entire column to rebut. 
At the July 17 ordinance meeting, Sanchez also said, “I’d rather have an empty building there, that we’re paying $300,00 for (per year), than to give it over to a charter school system.” 
At the same meeting, Councilor Justin Rois said, “We’re giving a few lifeboats away and keeping students in PPSD on a sinking ship…” Councilor, did you hear yourself? PPSD was a sinking ship in the early 1990s when I joined the Providence School Board. Without serious structural changes, the schools have no hope of getting better and never did.
To use Rois’ description of the schools, the obvious thing to do would be to provide as many lifeboats as we possibly can until the sinking ship either sinks or makes itself attractive enough to compete with the desirable schools the council so denigrates.
So, here you are, Rhode Island. These are your tax dollars at work.
Bring on the lifeboats.

A new survey of more than 700 Hampton Roads residents found that a majority expect major risks from flooding in the decades to come.
But people’s perceptions of flood risk varied widely depending on where they live and their demographic background, suggesting potential disparities in how the impacts of flooding are felt across the seven cities.
Questions about flooding were part of Old Dominion University’s annual Life in Hampton Roads survey, which aims to gain insight into residents’ opinions on topics including politics, health, education and the economy. The 2025 survey was conducted online, instead of via phone as in previous years.
Tancy Vandecar-Burdin, director of ODU’s Social Science Research Center, said the answers show flooding is on most residents’ minds.
“I think residents’ perceptions are reflecting reality,” she said. They are “recognizing the risk of flooding to their homes and neighborhoods and to their city as a whole.”
About 72% of respondents believed there is some or a high risk of severe flooding from sea level rise in their city over the next 30 years. Residents of Norfolk were the most likely to report risk, followed closely by Portsmouth and Virginia Beach.
The proportion dropped off as the questions got more granular: About 53% of people reported risk in their specific neighborhood, and 43% to their individual property.

The ODU survey has frequently included questions about flooding and climate change, but the specific questions vary each year.
This year, officials were particularly interested in learning about the impacts of flooding on housing, reflecting growing concerns about affordable housing.
Flooding is an exacerbating factor, Vandecar-Burdin said. As flooding gets more severe, it could make some places unlivable, reducing the housing stock while making lower-risk areas less affordable.
Some Hampton Roads residents already believe the issue is impacting their property’s worth.
Almost a third of respondents said they believe flood risk has somewhat or greatly affected their area’s property values – especially in Norfolk, where the percentage was nearly half.
Black residents and those with lower household incomes were significantly more likely to report decreased property values.
Vandecar-Burdin said that’s in line with other research that shows marginalized communities are more vulnerable to flooding.
“Folks that have higher socioeconomic status have greater capacity and resources, which allow them to be more selective about where they buy or rent their home,” she said.

But increasing perceptions of flood risk don’t seem to be drastically changing people’s behavior, she said.
Only about a quarter of respondents said flood risk information influenced decisions about their current housing. And rates of buying flood insurance have barely budged since the surveys began 15 years ago.
Vandecar-Burdin said she hopes the findings will encourage local leaders to help provide residents with information on how to assess and mitigate their risk.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)As the first fall leaves drifted to the ground in Damascus Town Park on a recent warm September day, Mayor Katie Lamb spoke to an audience just off the Virginia Creeper Trail trailhead. One year ago, Laurel Creek began to rise and quickly flooded downtown — washing away homes and battering businesses.
“Helene came in with a vengeance, and she may have damaged and destroyed our structures, but she did not shatter our Appalachian mountain virtues or our love for our town,” Lamb said.

Reportedly, 140 structures in Damascus were damaged or destroyed – bringing an estimated $12 million in damages to residential properties, businesses and public facilities. The state endured an estimated $4 billion in damage and hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of debris were strewn across the region. Three people in Virginia died as a result of the storm, as well as over 250 people in other states.
In Damascus, home to 747 residents, the floodwaters washed out bridges and trestles, sending debris slamming into each  bridge until it gave way and the surging currents flowed down to the next. The Laurel Creek water gauge read 18 feet before it was washed away. 
As the mayor spoke 12 months after the devastating storm, crews could be heard jackhammering away the former bridge on Orchard Hill Road. The washed out bridge still rests on the banks, evidence of the sheer force of the flood waters that came through.

While people were rushing to save their homes and lives, the livelihood of many in the region was being washed away farther east. 
Multiple popular hiking and biking trails, such as the Appalachian Trail, converge near Damascus. Many of the town businesses are catered to visitors who wish to bike the 34-mile gravel trail that stretches from Abingdon to White Top along old train routes. The most popular portion is from White Top to Damascus, as it is mostly downhill and shaded in trees. Helene’s flooding almost wiped that portion off the map completely.

“We lost so much the day that the trail flooded. October’s always the busiest month, and that’s how we get through the winter by having a huge October,” said Michael Wright, owner of Adventure Damascus Bicycles and another business.
Developers are currently bidding on rebuilding the 17-mile portion of the trail that was most frequented by bikers of all ages. There is a tentative timeline of it reopening by October 2026. The project is estimated to cost $200-300 million.
Seated in the office of one of his stores, Wright said business is down about 75% for his bicycle rental and shuttle storefront. His employees took calls in the background, explaining to customers that the popular part of the trail is going to be closed for at least another year. Hundreds of bikes are lined up in the back of the building, waiting to be taken out. 
Wright’s other business, which outfits Appalachian Trail hikers, is down about 30% this year despite the trail being fully open. About 400 miles of the trail was closed across multiple states immediately after the storm.

He had never seen flooding like that in all his years living in the area. In all his years living in the area, Wright said he’s never seen flooding like Helene’s. His bicycle rental store along Laurel Creek had multiple inches of water in it. He had to lay off most of his employees in the wake of the storm, but has been able to hire back some of them, mostly part-time workers. 
“So, you know, everything’s just gone, in an instant. We didn’t know what to do, where to go, but we just started cleaning up,” Wright said.
Two homes just across the trail that runs alongside his store were washed away in the flood and have already been replaced. When Wright posted on Facebook that the bike shop doors were open again months after the flood, a couple that had been coming to Damascus for years drove all the way from Alabama to give them business and support them through tough times.
“I’ve been doing this for almost 30 years, but over the years, people come to town and they love coming to town. I love the place so much,” Wright said. “I didn’t realize as many people had the same feeling that I did. But it makes perfect sense. That’s why they keep coming back.”
The town has been working hard to leverage other activities and the second half of the Creeper Trail to show visitors that they are still open for business. 
“We’re nervous about this winter for sure. We have a lot of hope now that the trail will be open next year,” Wright said.
Down the main drag of town, Blue Blaze is another bike rental shop that has had to adjust to operating with only a portion of the Creeper Trail open. Owner Rich DeArmond, at his front desk  that still bears the water marks of Helene’s flooding, explained that he has invested in more e-bikes to help people bike the Damascus to Abingdon portion of the trail, which is not as downhill and more of a challenge for some riders. He describes this shift as a new beginning.

The town parks and recreation department has been emphasizing other draws to town such as trout fishing, hiking trails, and the overall peacefulness of the small community nestled in the middle of the mountains. Most of the businesses that were flooded are back open and looking for visitors to come in the door.
“We could either sit around and be sad, or we could do something about it, and so we decided to do everything we could to bring Damascus back,” Julie Kroll, the town recreation director, said.
Right next to where the bridge over Laurel Creek was washed out, Jennifer Walker had owned a rental home for six years. At the time of the storm she had tenants staying there who, fortunately, evacuated in time as the water quickly rose and eventually destroyed the house.
Walker and her family live just across the North Carolina border, a state that was lashed most severely by Helene. Their home was hit with a powerful mudslide that knocked part of the house off the foundation and ripped portions off to be carried away. They did not live in a floodplain and did not have flood insurance so they’ve had to rely on a small award from FEMA and slowly put what they can back into its reconstruction.
“In the back of our heads, we’re like, this is horrible, but we have our Damascus house. So we have a place to go … we went up to the top of our mountain, tried 81 times to make a phone call, and I got one call through to my mom. And at the same time, a video came through from the renters, and they said, ‘we’re sorry, it’s bad’,” Walker said.
While the home that held many memories of wintering in Damascus for them, Walker is eager for her new venture to come to life. In the spirit of the Creeper Trail, she has purchased two train cabooses that will be made into a hotel. She hopes it will be a fun experience for people who come through to ride the trail that passes right next to the property.
“You know, it’s just one of those things where you’re like, I’m glad that this town has bounced back.  It’s cool. I mean, it’s just, and I’m not saying that because I have a place here, but it is a really special little town,” Walker said.
Washington County residents were awarded $2.4 million in individual assistance from FEMA; $2.1 million of that was distributed in Damascus. The nonprofit Trails to Recovery has raised $1.7 million in private donations and aided in repairing 83 homes and doing complete rebuilds of eight houses for county residents since the storm.
In April, Gov. Glenn Youngkin accelerated unlocking funds from the $46,670,000 allocated to Virginia by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through disaster recovery grants. A number of disaster loans were made available to southwest Virginians who were in need of assistance to build back their homes and businesses.
With the construction of the trail set to begin in the coming months, there are efforts to have workers stay in town and utilize local businesses for transportation to work sites. Wright said there is a possibility of his shuttle being used – which would help them survive the winter financially. The Old Mill Inn operators said they hope to have some workers stay there.

Lamb became emotional during a tour of local businesses, explaining how hard they’ve worked to bounce back. She said they’ll never know the names of all the volunteers who flocked to the town to help people muck out their homes and rebuild structures. Damascus is hosting an event on Sept. 27, the day the waters rose, to show appreciation for those who helped them. 
The town of Damascus has a population of less than 1,000. But during certain events that all revolve around the trails in the area, thousands of people gather there. When walking downtown now, it could be hard for out of towners to know what devastation was wrought there only a year ago. There are signs of it in the water lines on wood, the erosion of the water fronts, and the ongoing construction. But the spirit of Damascus has not diminished and residents are still welcoming visitors, whom they say are a lifeline of their community’s economy. 
“We’re going to be better than we’ve ever been because we have each other, and we are damn strong,” Lamb said.

Mike DeWine said during recent comments at the Ohio Department of Higher Education’s Trustees Conference. 
DeWine covered many topics during his nearly 50 minute speech including briefly talking about free speech on campuses, cell phones in college classrooms, and how colleges of education are training future teachers when it comes to teaching students how to read. 
He did not mention Ohio’s new higher education law, Senate Bill 1, that bans diversity efforts, prohibits faculty strikes, and regulates classroom discussion, among other things.

“The horrible, horrible, horrible tragedy, Charlie Kirk on a college campus, engaging in free speech, being gunned down,” DeWine said. “I’m talking about the obligation, I think, that colleges have to create a culture … colleges should be a place of ideas.”  
Kirk, a right-wing political activist, was shot and killed last week while he was speaking at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University. 
“I’m not really talking about (Kirk’s death), how that could have been prevented or couldn’t have been prevented,” DeWine said. “That’s a security issue.”
Universities, he said, need to create an environment on campus that respects ideas. 
“You might disagree with one of your fellow students, but that’s kind of what college is all about,” DeWine said. “It’s exploring and getting different ideas. … Free speech is important. It’s important everywhere, but it’s also super important, I think, in the village of college campuses.”
Cell phones 
Ohio recently banned cell phones in K-12 schools and DeWine wants college students to put their phones away, too. 
“I suggest you ban them in your classrooms,” he said. “It’s that simple.”
When speaking to reporters afterwards, DeWine said he does not think there should necessarily be a law around cell phones in colleges. 
“I don’t think we’re looking to tell colleges to (ban cell phones),” DeWine said. “That was a strong suggestion. … What we know about these devices is that they pull people away from thinking about what’s going on in that classroom.” 
Reading 
This is the second school year Ohio school districts are required to teach the science of reading, which incorporates phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. DeWine has helped champion the science of reading in Ohio by originally putting it in the state’s 2023 budget, which was eventually signed into law.
“Think phonics on steroids,” DeWine said. “Reading, to state the obvious, is essential to success in K-12, it’s essential to your success in college. It’s more importantly, though, essential to your success in life.”
The Ohio Department of Higher Education conducted an audit to show how each educator training program aligns with teaching the science of reading instruction. Under state law, Chancellor Mike Duffey can revoke a college or university’s approval if they fail the audit. 
The audits are completed, and colleges and universities with educator training program will be hearing their results in the coming months, DeWine said. 
“I’ve seen the results,” he said. “Some of them are great, but some of them are not. We still have colleges in the state of Ohio that do not follow the science of reading. That’s a problem.”

Situated between Charleston and Parkersburg, two of the state’s largest cities, the rural county is known for its small towns and historic buildings.
That’s how Sherry Husted, the director of the Roane County Public Libraries, described her native community as she worked last week at Geary Public Library in Left Hand, West Virginia. Each of the county’s three library branches has at least three public computers and free internet access, among other services.
These services are essential to residents living in Roane — where less than 32% of the county’s households, businesses and community buildings — have reliable internet connectivity, according to the Federal Communications Commission’s National Broadband Map.
“We love our rural area,” Husted said. “But there’s always the catch. You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.”
Members of the library staff regularly help patrons fill out job applications and build resumes. They also help those who have never used a desktop computer before — many of the county’s residents rely on their cellular devices and spotty mobile service, Husted said. Most residents still use landline phones, she added.
And those with internet access at home are paying a steep price. Husted’s plan with Frontier, which includes fiber internet and a landline, comes to $170 a month.
“If you work from home, you need reliable internet,” she said. “Frontier does the best they can. But this is a very rural area, so the trees and terrain are constantly messing up the internet. And because of the demand on these older lines, your internet may not be reliable enough to host things like meetings or classes.”
Roane County is one of the areas federal officials hoped to support through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, or BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access. The $42.45 billion initiative, created under the Biden administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, aimed to close the digital divide — with a focus on rural communities.
The Trump administration’s changes to the program, however, have disqualified hundreds of thousands of locations — including homes, businesses and community buildings — from receiving internet access. And the program’s new technology-neutral approach will also shift a large portion of the federal funds toward satellite internet companies, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, that cost less to build but have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable.  That means households and businesses that were looking forward to reliable, high-speed internet will no longer get support from the BEAD program.
While some experts were initially skeptical about the program’s goals, every state utilized its allocated funds to develop plans to provide high-speed fiber internet to nearly every home and business in the country, said Christopher Mitchell, the director of the Community Broadband Networks Initiative with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an anti-corporate advocacy group.
Most states are expected to get started on deployment projects in 2026. But the Trump administration’s changes have undermined the major investment for rural areas, Mitchell said.
“I think everyone should care about it — even though most people don’t live in rural America — because when we electrified the entire country, the entire economy grew,” Mitchell said. “We will all benefit from this when everyone has more options to share their knowledge, their gifts and their productivity in the economy.”
Even West Virginia, ranking last in internet connectivity, would have effectively achieved universal broadband under the state’s original proposal, according to an unreleased draft of the state’s plan obtained by The Benton Institute for Broadband and Society, a policy group. West Virginia has about 78% connectivity, the only state with less than 80%.
But under West Virginia’s updated final proposal, submitted to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration earlier this month, tens of thousands of households and businesses will no longer have access to BEAD funding.
West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he is still optimistic about the rollout, telling reporters recently that some of the decrease in coverage was because of inaccurate information. Some areas had just a few homes, or addresses only had a barn on the property, he and an aide said.
“We’ve been trying to target all the available locations that are eligible,” the governor said Sept. 18 at a news conference at the West Virginia State Capitol. “It’s a pretty fulsome application, and so obviously there were some changes made to accommodate some of the responses from the administration. And in a positive way, they’re trying to save money.”
There are other changes: Internet providers  will no longer be required to provide a low-cost service option to residents to address affordability concerns. And under the “technology-neutral” approach, some locations will no longer be receiving fiber internet, which the federal government previously emphasized due to its speed and durability.










You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.


– Sherry Husted, director of the Roane County Public Libraries


The new guidelines also remove provisions that encouraged states to work with companies and representatives from minority communities. Requirements related to labor, the environment and climate change also were cut.
West Virginia isn’t alone. Under the new rules, thousands of households, businesses and community buildings across the country will be disqualified from the federal government’s push to provide internet access to the areas that need itmost. And those locations that are still eligible for funding may not receive the best service available — or be able to afford it.
West Virginia has one of the country’s worst workforce participation rates. Internet access is key to changing that, said Bill Bissett, chairman of the West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council.
“We are hopeful that this new proposal will be supported because we need to get started on this development as soon as possible,” Bissett said. “Because the longer we wait, the less people will be connected because of increased costs in deployment and infrastructure.”

Following the required revisions, West Virginia fared well compared with other states, said Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. But Garner said he expects frustration in other states.
“West Virginia, because it did a good job with its restructuring, is still going to have a lot of strong outcomes,” Garner said. “But across the country in some of these other states, I think there’s going to be a lot of frustration with these changes and the way it walked back from what was going to be a very promising outcome.”
BEAD restructuring
In June, the Trump administration revised the rules of the BEAD program in what the U.S. Department of Commerce said was an effort to lessen regulatory burdens, reduce costs and streamline the process.
As of Sept. 18, 41 states had submitted their updated final proposals, according to a database from Connected Nation, a nonprofit that advocates for expanded broadband access.
In December 2022, when the FCC released its updated National Broadband Map, nearly 12 million locations across the country were in need of internet service. Over the years, that number has decreased because of private investments, continued deployment by existing internet providers and additional support from other federal programs.
States originally identified 4.86 million locations that would be eligible for getting internet connectivity through BEAD funds. But that number is projected to fall to 4.19 million locations following revisions initiated by the Trump administration, according to an analysis from Broadband Expanded, a project from the New York Law School.
West Virginia was originally slated to deploy broadband to approximately 110,000 locations. Now, 73,560 of those locations will receive BEAD funding, according to the state’s new proposal. Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Nebraska and Rhode Island could see more than half of the locations in their state disqualified from the program.
But some of those locations may still be in need of internet, said Garner, of the Benton Institute.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, directed states to remove certain locations from the BEAD program because they’d acquired internet access from another source.
But, in an effort to save taxpayer money, states also had the option to say they were “financially incapable” of serving a location.
“One of the changes the administration made to the BEAD program is that states and the NTIA now have a way to simply say that these locations are just too expensive,” Garner said. “They can say, ‘It is just going to cost too much, so now we’re going to say they’re ineligible.’”
Trump’s broadband program overhaul favors Musk tech, strips low-cost plans

The BEAD program’s new technology-neutral approach poses another challenge. The original program favored fiber because of its speed, reliability and ability to reach remote locations. But some argue that other technologies would be cheaper.
This change has opened the door for satellite internet providers, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, to receive money from the program. Starlink could be awarded approximately $10 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.
In West Virginia, Starlink will serve more than 4,100 locations, according to the governor’s office.
“Based on the technology and based on all the evidence we have, some of these technologies — unlicensed fixed wireless especially — are not really a reliable internet service that’s going to meet the needs of a 21st century household,” Garner said.
Rural advocates speak up
In Nebraska, more than half of the counties in the state have signed onto letters to federal officials objecting to the changes, including the disqualification of nearly half the state’s eligible locations.
“It’s very frustrating. We have all these holes in our county, and BEAD was going to bring service to those areas,” Milford County Commissioner Misty Ahmic told the Nebraska Examiner.
Critics in Pennsylvania have said directing funds toward satellite companies is “shortsighted.” Satellite companies Starlink and Project Kuiper, an Amazon subsidiary, were awarded a combined $19.2 million to expand internet access in Pennsylvania.
And in Oklahoma, critics noticed the updated plan would not be using $225 million of the state’s allocated BEAD funds.
The state’s head broadband official said the new proposal would still serve everyone, but critics told the Oklahoma Voice that it would be wrong to send back any federal money while people across the state continue to struggle with internet access.
Originally, states were allowed to use these leftover funds to pay for things other than broadband deployment, such as West Virginia’s plans to improve cellular service and streamline the permitting process for broadband projects. But the federal telecommunications agency has not released guidance on how the leftover funds are to be used under the restructured program.
“There’s a lot of fear right now that NTIA may try to call that money back, which would be a big shame,” Garner said. “That leftover money is the state’s, according to the law. And these ancillary funds would play a huge role to support the BEAD program.”
Affordability also will be a barrier for some households. States are no longer required to provide a low-cost service option for low-income households under the changes. And the federal Affordable Connectivity Program ended last year without additional funding from Congress.
Morrisey said his administration is being aggressive, collaborating with the Trump administration to get internet access to eligible areas.
“I applaud the Trump administration for working with us, but once again, I am not going to do a victory lap until we actually get this all done,” the governor said.
Providing internet to every person in West Virginia was always a lofty goal, said Husted, the Roane County Public Library director.  Other initiatives have promised to connect rural residents over the years, Husted said, and she remains skeptical about this outcome.
“In rural areas, you’re going to need to plan for things, and sometimes that puts us at a disadvantage compared to the cities,” Husted said. “With the internet or with other supplies, sometimes we have to decide what is more important to us.”

The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has sparked a wave of political commentary.
There were the respectful and sincere comments condemning the killing. Former President Barack Obama said, “What happened was a tragedy and … I mourn for him and his family.” And former Vice President Mike Pence said, “I’m heartsick about what happened to him.”
But Kirk’s killing also elicited what many saw as inappropriate comments. MSNBC terminated commentator Matthew Dowd after he said, “Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions.” American Airlines grounded pilots accused of celebrating Kirk’s death.
Perhaps the most notable reaction to remarks seen as controversial about the Kirk killing hit ABC comedian Jimmy Kimmel. His network suspended him indefinitely after comments that he made about the alleged shooter in Kirk’s death.
Countless defenders of Kimmel quickly responded to his indefinite suspension as an attack on the First Amendment. MSNBC host Chris Hayes posted the following on X: “This is the most straightforward attack on free speech from state actors I’ve ever seen in my life and it’s not even close.”
But is it?
 
 FCC Chairman Brendan Carr’s statement about how Jimmy Kimmel’s remarks could hurt ABC affiliate stations.


Free speech? It depends
The First Amendment limits government officials from infringing one’s right to free speech and expression.
For example, the government cannot force someone to recite the Pledge of Allegiance or salute the American flag, because the First Amendment, as one Supreme Court justice wrote, “includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.”
And government cannot limit speech that it finds disagreeable while permitting other speech that it favors.
However, the First Amendment does not apply to private employers. With the exception of the 13th Amendment, which generally prohibits slavery, the Constitution applies only to government and those acting on its behalf.
So, as a general rule, employers are free to discipline employees for their speech – even the employees’ speech outside of the workplace. In this way, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham correctly said on X, “Free speech doesn’t prevent you from being fired if you’re stupid and have poor judgment.”
This is why Amy Cooper’s employer, an investment firm, was free to terminate her following her 2020 verbal dispute in New York’s Central Park with a bird-watcher over her unleashed dog. She called the police, falsely claiming that the bird-watcher, a Black man, was threatening her life. The incident, captured on video, went viral and Cooper was fired, with her employer saying, “We do not condone racism of any kind.”
This is also why ABC was able to fire Roseanne Barr from the revival of her show, “Roseanne,” after she posted a tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a Black woman who had been a top aide to President Obama, that many viewed as racist.
But as a scholar of constitutional law, I believe Kimmel’s situation is not as straightforward.

Threat complicates things
Neither Cooper’s employer nor Barr’s employer faced any government pressure to terminate them.
Kimmel’s indefinite suspension followed a vague threat from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr. As complaints about Kimmel’s statement exploded in conservative media, Carr suggested in a podcast interview that Kimmel’s statements could lead to the FCC revoking ABC affiliate stations’ licenses.
“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said.
But the Supreme Court has been crystal clear. Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors.
In a 2024 case, National Rifle Association v. Vullo, a unanimous Supreme Court plainly said that the government’s threat of invoking legal sanctions and other coercion to suppress speech it doesn’t like violates the First Amendment. That principle is so profound and fundamental that it got support from every member of an often bitterly divided court.
A threat to revoke broadcast licenses would almost certainly be seen in a court of law as a government action tantamount to coercion. And Carr’s public comments undoubtedly connect that threat to Kimmel’s disfavored comments.
If the FCC had indeed moved to strip ABC affiliates of their licenses to broadcast because of what Kimmel said, ABC and its parent company, Disney, could have sued the FCC to block the license revocations on First Amendment grounds, citing the NRA v. Vullo case.
But the network seemingly caved to the coercive threat instead of fighting for Kimmel. This is why so many are decrying the Kimmel suspension as an attack on free speech and the First Amendment – even though they might not fully understand the law they’re citing.

(Getty Images)As data center development takes off across the United States and the world, New Hampshire legislators and regulators are weighing what steps their state, and its aging electric grid, should take to prepare.
“For me, it’s worth considering. There may be an opportunity here, but I think there’s also concerns,” said Sen. David Watters, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Data centers — large, energy-hungry facilities housing computer networks — are rapidly becoming more common nationwide, data center developer Craig McGahey told New Hampshire lawmakers and energy professionals at the 2025 New Hampshire Energy Summit, organized by consulting and lobbying firm Dupont Group on Sept. 15.
The rise of artificial intelligence is the biggest factor contributing to increasing data center demand, McGahey said, citing competition among so-called “hyperscalers” — expansive cloud computing companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and others. 
“As this race for AI dominance continues, we don’t see it stopping, and it’s going to continue on for many, many years,” he said.
Nationally, construction of data centers is at an all-time high, Reuters reports. And as of March 2025, the United States had more of the facilities than any other nation, according to a Statista tally. 
In other states, some of which have hundreds of data centers, the facilities have strained electric grids and, in some cases, water supplies. Yet, for now, New Hampshire is not among those: 10 relatively small-scale facilities were listed statewide on the website Data Center Map as of September 2025, putting New Hampshire in the bottom fifth nationally.
Some see an ‘emerging market.’ Others, an environmental threat.
That may, however, be set to change. Low power availability and high electricity costs have so far been the principal factors preventing an influx of data centers in New Hampshire like that seen in some other states, McGahey said. But he added that he considered the Northeast as a whole an “emerging market” for the centers.
Developers like himself, he said, were assessing different states’ regulatory landscapes, land availability, and power supplies to determine where to site new centers, which can range in size from normal office buildings to projects spanning hundreds of acres.
Lawmakers are divided on whether data center development would be an opportunity or a concern for New Hampshire.
Citing property tax revenue and employment benefits, some legislators said they wanted to see New Hampshire create a regulatory environment that would favor data centers. 
“I think New Hampshire should court any business into the state,” said Rep. Doug Thomas, vice chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, in an interview. “In order for them to come here, there has to be a market. And so we have to … show them that we’re interested.” 
He and House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Chair Michael Vose cited construction and jobs as a primary benefit of growing data centers in New Hampshire. In his presentation, McGahey said a data center of the scale likely to be established in New Hampshire could employ as many as 40 people full-time, and potentially hundreds more during construction. 
Others questioned whether those estimates represented enough jobs to make a meaningful impact on employment. Rep. Thomas Cormen, a member of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, said in an interview the amount of people employed by data centers does not typically scale up proportionally as the centers increase in size. And, he added, for a relatively uncomplicated building like the typical warehouse-style data center, the construction phase might not last particularly long, meaning the bulk of jobs created would be temporary. 
Watters said data center jobs were not substantially better-paying than jobs in other preexisting industries. “Some of the biggest ones employ maybe 100 to 200 people at a $40,000 (annual) salary,” Watters said. “I mean, that’s McDonalds. … They might make close to $40,000, too.”
Cormen also raised environmental concerns. Some data centers are cooled with river water, a practice that raises the temperature of the water downstream, Cormen said. This could be harmful to the river itself or cause dangerous ice dams and flooding in winter, he said. 
“I think a lot of people have environmental concerns, and power concerns,” Watters said. 
Uncertainty about how data centers would be powered, Cormen said, is another hurdle; while drawing from the grid could raise electricity costs for other ratepayers, the type and effects of unregulated local generators are another unknown.
“Before you know it, we’re talking about diesel generation,” he said. “We just don’t know.”
Speculating to meet demand
Some states have weighed implementing special rate schedules to offset the impact of increased on-grid data center demand on ratepayers, but Vose said he did not expect the New Hampshire Legislature to consider such a system in the near future.
Instead, Vose and other legislators discussed ways to increase New Hampshire’s electricity generation down the road, including through speculative technology like small, modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs.
The New Hampshire Department of Energy is assessing whether SMRs could someday be implemented in New Hampshire, Director of Energy Innovation Thomas Barrasso said at the summit. SMRs could power data centers within “microgrids,” small regionalized power grids that could operate either independently of or in tandem with the rest of the grid, he said.
“I think the microgrid piece of this, the grid modernization piece of this, the SMR piece of this kind of all start to fit together,” Barrasso said.
At the summit, Barrasso expressed optimism about small modular reactors, saying he felt the tide of public opinion toward nuclear energy was changing. A Gallup poll published in April supported this impression, showing 61% of Americans in favor of nuclear power — a six percentage point increase over the previous poll in 2023.
However, SMR critics point out that the technology is still in development, questioning Barrasso’s statement at the summit that they could eventually be “plug and play” solutions to bolster New Hampshire’s energy offerings. It may be anywhere from five to 15 years before the generators could hypothetically be deployed, according to Barrasso’s presentation. 
SMRs are a “convenient” discussion for people resistant to renewable energy development, Watters said in an interview. “The interest is being driven by people who think SMRs are the answer to every problem in the world,” he said. But they are not the only way data centers could be powered, he noted.
Other technologies, including forms of renewable energy, are deployable now and could be implemented with less investment, said Dan Weeks, of solar developer ReVision Energy, at the summit. Weeks highlighted grid-scale batteries and renewable generation as other options that the state could direct attention to rather than the hypothetical future deployment of SMRs.
“Is the (Department of Energy) thinking about meeting these rising energy needs and cost concerns through … greater deployment of existing technologies that are at this point pretty far down the cost curve and probably a lot closer in the future than SMRs?” Weeks asked.
“My job was to sort of get ‘all of the above’ into the mindset of everyone,” Barrasso responded.
The Legislature has already taken some steps toward localized power generation that could be used to power facilities like data centers through SMRs. House Bill 672, sponsored by Vose and signed by Gov. Ayotte in August, paved the way for off-grid energy generators to sell power directly to buyers. Vose said he hoped that bill would “encourage” microgrids. (The bill also exempts off-grid electricity providers from renewable energy standards and the rate regulations on-grid generation is subject to.)
A resolution to declare the development of advanced nuclear technology “in the best interest of New Hampshire” also passed last session, but legislators failed to pass House Bill 710, which would have allowed utilities to own and operate SMRs. A similar bill sponsored by Sen. Kevin Avard will come before the Legislature in 2026, according to a legislative service request listed on the General Court of New Hampshire website.
McGahey acknowledged the push to build data centers quickly had led developers to look toward more quickly deployable energy solutions than SMRs. In other states, developers have constructed new gas generators to meet data center demand, he said. 
“Because this race is so intense, we’re looking for solutions in two to three years. We are looking at battery storage solutions. We’re looking at natural gas plants,” McGahey said.
Looking ahead
During his presentation, McGahey forecasted demand for a wave of smaller data centers within the next three to five years. The appetite of New Hampshire policymakers and utilities toward that development, McGahey said, could play a role in determining to what extent that development progresses locally.
The reality that New Hampshire’s grid is facing, including difficulties from power shortages and aging transmission lines, may make it unlikely that the state ever sees data center development on a large scale, Watters said. 
“It’s hard for me to imagine that there’d be an interest in siting them here,” he said. 
But the possibility, and related concerns, were worth discussing, he said, and others at the summit agreed.
“We need to get people to the table to start to talk about what the future is going to look like,” Barrasso said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/datacenter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 05:56:29.643061

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos for New Jersey Monitor/States Newsroom.)The Ohio Supreme Court is considering the case of an Allen County man named Patrick Heffley who says he should be able to purchase firearms again, despite several domestic violence convictions.
A lower court said no, he couldn’t, but Ohio’s Third District Court of Appeals disagreed. State prosecutors appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, insisting Heffley remains under weapons disability, and is thus barred from possessing firearms.
Federal statute generally prohibits a person with a misdemeanor or felony domestic violence conviction from having a gun. It provides, however, a handful of exceptions including the state restoration of the person’s civil rights. But under Ohio statute, restoration of civil rights hinges on an individual not being “otherwise prohibited by law” from having a firearm.
“Isn’t he caught between a rock and a hard place?” Justice Pat Fischer asked.
Assistant Allen County Prosecuting Attorney John Willamowksi readily acknowledged Heffley’s in a bind.
“It is effectively one statute saying (to) the state, you go first,” he said, “and the state statute saying federal disability, you be removed (first).”
Still, Willamowski argued state law is “plain and unambiguous.” Until Heffley’s federal weapons disability is gone, he can’t have his state civil rights restored. And until his state civil rights are restored, his federal weapons disability can’t be removed.
Background
Beginning in 2000, Heffley was convicted of a string of domestic violence offenses, including one fourth degree felony in 2006. Heffley served his sentence, paid his fines and court costs and made it through parole without incident. Since his release, Heffley told the trial court, his only contact with law enforcement was getting pulled over for a seatbelt violation.
Under federal law, a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction is enough to lose gun rights and so is a “crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.” Heffley was sentenced to 12 months for his felony, but the offense is punishable by up to 18 months behind bars.
In its arguments, the state leans on that felony conviction as the weapons disability keeping Heffley from getting a gun. In response, Heffley’s legal team points to a statement of legislative intent included as uncodified language in 2011’s House Bill 54.
The provision states, in no uncertain terms, that “The General Assembly is explicitly making this amendment to clarify that relief from a weapons disability (…) restores a person’s civil firearm rights to such an extent that the uniform federal ban on possessing any firearms at all (…) does not apply to that person.”
But the state dismissed that legislative language. The same section was subsequently amended — without the intent language — raising the question of whether the earlier, uncodified provision actually speaks to the current statute.
Oral arguments
More fundamentally, Heffley’s attorney Andrea Henning contends the state is misreading that “otherwise prohibited by law” provision in the underlying statute.
“Otherwise does not refer to the existence of the federal disability,” she told the justices. “It would refer to having a source other than what you’re seeking relief under.”
From Henning’s point of view, Heffley might be barred from relief if there was some other offense, but his state and federal weapons disability are fundamentally the same thing. Ohio’s courts can’t separate them for the purpose of legal analysis.
She said pitting the state and federal disabilities against one another, as the state suggests, would mean there’s Ohioans in Heffley’s shoes have little chance of ever restoring their gun rights.
“Despite,” Henning reminded them, “the legislature determining that they are worthy of an avenue to ask the court to consider granting this relief.”
Henning’s arguments resonated with some Republican members on the bench. Justices Pat Fischer and Pat DeWine pressed Willamowksi to explain away the uncodified section lawmakers approved in 2011.
“Do you think the result that you’re advocating today is what The General Assembly intended when they passed the statute?” DeWine asked. “I know the statute may say something different, but do you think that this is what they intended? That there is no way to get relief for this? That they’re in this Catch-22 circle?”
Even blunter, Fischer asked, “Why have an uncodified section? What was the point?”
Willamowski said it doesn’t really matter what lawmakers wanted — it matters what they wrote. If the General Assembly isn’t happy with the outcome, he said, they’ve got all the authority they need to change the law anytime they wish.
What’s more, Willamowski said, Heffley isn’t actually stuck in some Kafkaesque maze of contradictory laws. It might be a longshot, but he can seek a pardon or apply through the federal courts to rescind his weapons disability.
“You can apply to the United States Attorney General for relief from that federal firearms disability,” he said. “Whether individuals are regularly granted that or not, is something for the legislature to decide when they are crafting their statute here.”
And while Henning contends the state’s reading would set aside lawmakers’ stated intent, Willamowski argued the one Heffley and the appeals court favor, would create an even more “illogical” outcome.
Existing Ohio precedent holds state courts can’t remove a firearms disability that doesn’t stem from a state violation. Because federal law considers misdemeanor domestic violence grounds for weapons disability, while Ohio law does not, state courts can’t restore the gun rights of a person with a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction.
“If it is interpreted as the Third District (Appeals Court) is asking it to be, it would create an instance where it would almost incentivize individuals,” Willamowski said. “If you have a felony offense in that circumstance you could get your firearm rights back, where in the misdemeanor circumstance you couldn’t do so.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230211gunOrama03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 04:56:14.445266

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Under normal conditions, a wild blueberry field would display a patchwork of greens dotted with light blue, silver or even black blueberries. 
But this summer, fields in Hancock and Washington counties also bore shades of brown. 
“You’ll see a patch that’s like really crispy, but right next to it, another plant that’s green,” said Lily Calderwood, a wild blueberry specialist at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension. 
Calderwood spent the summer continuing a multi-year research project that looks at the benefits of applying mulch to wild blueberry fields. She’s been studying how the thickness of the mulch affects soil moisture and pest management. 
Her work has revealed a sweet spot with 1 to 1.5 inches of mulch that she has learned could even buffer the impact from early stages of droughts. But mulching would not have staved off the harm done by the dry conditions farmers saw this year. 
“Once you get to severe drought that we saw this August, it can’t replace irrigation,” she said. 
Although farmers and growers have historically been able to rely on even rainfall throughout the growing season in Maine, the agricultural community has been forced to deal with more moisture extremes. The 2020 growing season marked the driest in state history, while the wettest growing season on record came just three years later. 
In light of uncertain federal support, Common Ground Fair takes on added importance for farmers

Coping with these conditions has become a challenge for farms whose income hinges on precipitation levels and could even have larger economic effects as wild blueberries alone contribute more than $350 million annually to the state economy. Many farmers don’t have the money or expertise to plan and install irrigation infrastructure on their land, so they are hoping state support can fill those gaps. 
This particularly dry summer just so happened to coincide with the launch of a new drought relief fund that the state set up to assist farmers with the financial and technical aspects of adding irrigation systems. The program is in its nascent stages as the first round of projects were approved earlier this year. Those grants will help a couple dozen farms, but some experts worry the fund and other existing programs won’t be enough to meet the growing need. 
A “flash drought”
Prior to June, there weren’t any concerns of a drought this summer. 
The state had just come off more than a dozen rainy weekends in a row in the spring and there was decent rainfall at the end of the month. However, that changed in mid- to late-July as the state saw long stretches of little to no rain. 
“After July 21, this is when conditions started to deteriorate,” said Sean Birkel, the state climatologist and an assistant professor at the University of Maine. 
With virtually no rainfall for the second half July and the first half of August, conditions worsened. Harvesters were out in the fields in the first week of August picking plump blueberries from the stem, Calderwood said, but she remembers hearing conversations among growers about how dry it was getting. Those who had irrigation either already had it on or remarked that they should turn it on because wild blueberries require about one inch of water per week.
But it was the three-day heatwave from August 11-13 that pushed the prolonged precipitation deficit over the edge. On August 14, the National Weather Services announced a “flash drought” in parts of Maine and New Hampshire. From the fields, Calderwood said, “that is really what it felt like to a lot of farmers.” 
The plants started to turn brown and crispy. Normally the plants bounce back up as you walk through the fields, but Calderwood described how instead they crunched under their feet. Blueberries were shriveling up and even dropping to the ground. 
Thanks to the genetic diversity of Maine’s wild blueberries, some varieties are more drought resistant than others, which allowed some plants to maintain their luster. 
Birkel said a precise definition for flash drought is still debated and there are questions about the phenomenon, but this recent event gives more reason to better understand how they work.
Birkel said more analysis is needed to know how that stretch of drought compares historically, but Calderwood said it was the quickest onset of a drought she’s seen in her seven seasons. Her colleagues who have been doing this work for three decades told her the same.
Short term drought is relatively common in Maine and the northeast, Birkel said, but it’s unclear if events like the summer of 2020 or this past August will become more common or whether the state will experience fewer droughts in the future. What the data is showing is a trend toward more extremes — drier dry periods and wetter wet periods — Birkel said.  
Since mid-August, dry conditions in the northeast region have worsened with severe drought spreading from coastal Maine westward into the central part of the state, according to a Sept. 11 update from the National Integrated Drought Information System.

State relief fund
After the historic 2020 drought, Rachel Schattman, an assistant professor of sustainable agriculture at the University of Maine School of Food and Agriculture, worked with a group from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to survey the agricultural community about how they coped with the conditions. They learned that farmers need more help accessing water, Schattman said. 
She found that farmers and growers in Maine feel vulnerable to drought and see it taking a toll on their production. And although they are “starting to see irrigation as part of the cost of doing business,” they are underinvested in the necessary equipment and supplies because they haven’t needed it historically, Schattman said. 
As that research was unfolding, the state crafted a program to provide farmers with the financial and technical resources they said they need to mitigate droughts. 
The Farmers Drought Relief Fund was created by the Maine Legislature in 2021 with $1 million in startup funding and an annual appropriation of $300,000. With this fund, farmers can apply for $7,500 grants to pay for conservation planners to create water management plans or they can submit plans for specific projects such as water storage ponds or various types of wells. 
However, because of the slew of rainy Saturdays this spring, dry conditions weren’t top of mind for farmers when the state put out its first request for applications in April. Farmers were busy preparing their fields for the summer season, so the department only received 28 applications, 24 of which were funded, said Tom Gordon, a soil and water conservation program coordinator.
“Now, drought is at the forefront of farmers’ minds, and with the first round of funding out the door, we expect to have a lot of interest in applications for our second round of funding,” Gordon said, which will be announced in early 2026.
Among the successful applications, the department will fund 10 water management plans. Gordon said recent declines in federal appropriations and staffing for these services means there are actually “relatively few” conservation planners in Maine who can assist farmers. However, he said the department hopes to build this capacity in the future.
The department also funded four water storage ponds and 10 drilled wells for farms ranging in size from one to 1,100 acres. Most of them grow mixed vegetables, but some potato and wild blueberry operations also received funding. 
A “drop in the bucket” 
While Eric Venturini, executive director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine, said his organization is glad for the state relief fund and thinks it has real potential to help farmers, it’s “a drop in the bucket of what’s truly needed.”
Venturini was disappointed that applications for the first round opened up during a busy time of year for farmers and growers, but beyond that he said the Legislature can further help Maine’s agricultural industries by providing more sources of ongoing funding that deliver capital directly to farms. 
The wild blueberry industry is made up of more than 500 different farms that generate $361 million to the state’s economy annually. Venturini said that number only takes into account out-of-state fruit sales that bring money back to the state and doesn’t include in-state sales.

The hundreds of wild blueberry operations in Maine vary in size, so Venturini said some businesses have been able to modernize with technology that allows them to take on challenges like droughts. Others are more bogged down by thin profit-margins and costly conditions that not only require new, expensive infrastructure, but diminish the crop that feeds their bottom line. 
Last October, the commission received word that it would be awarded a $15.5 million federal grant that would flow to farmers to develop water sources, Venturini said. However, he also said it never came to fruition due to changes from the Trump administration, which did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this year, Maine Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) introduced legislation (LD 1140) for a $45 million bond to support the state’s agricultural, food and forest product economy. 
Most of the bond would be used to invest in forest products and the dairy sector, but $2.5 million of it would be earmarked for disaster relief. That slice of money would be “very, very important” given the historic droughts the state has seen recently, Daughtry said when introducing the bill to the Legislature’s budget committee. 
The proposed bond was carried over to the next legislative session, which will begin in January. However, even if it is supported by lawmakers, it would need to go to voters through a statewide referendum for final approval. The soonest voters could take up the issue would be November 2026.
With many personal ties to the agriculture community, including her mother who ran a wild blueberry field, Daughtry reiterated to Maine Morning Star that investing in farms is particularly critical in light of the changing climate and federal funding cuts. She said it was a priority even before this summer, but the drought underscored the need for rural resilience. 
Daughtry said she appreciates that bond proposals are “one of the only times that Maine people get a direct say.” She plans to continue being a strong advocate for the proposal because it could be a “game-changing investment” for farms.
“When a bond goes on a ballot, voters are able to vote on their values and really decide whether they want to support agriculture or disaster relief or transportation,” she said.
Daughtry said the Legislature will have the chance to reevaluate the bill to determine if the proposal would be enough to address what farmers are facing. 
“The drought this summer has shown that Maine farms of all types need help ensuring their businesses can stay viable and resilient in the face of increasingly unpredictable weather conditions,” said Shelley Megquier, policy and research director for Maine Farmland Trust, who also testified in support of LD 1140. 
“Maine has established programs, such as the Farmers Drought Relief Fund, to support farmers through dry summers like this one but they need to be robustly funded and effectively implemented to have real impact.”
Beyond that, Megquier told Maine Morning Star that Maine farmers need more flexible funding they can access quickly and easily in the face of climate disasters or seasons like this summer that brought about crop loss.

Yet the state’s economy continues to lag behind the national average, a report released earlier this month says.
In all, Ohio has 177 tax exemptions or deductions worth $20 million a year or more. In its last session, the General Assembly limited or eliminated nine, but it increased the cost of others, the report by Policy Matters Ohio said. 
Tax breaks on certain people and businesses are effectively tax increases on everybody else. That’s so because government services have to be paid for, and those who remain on the tax rolls have to bear the burden.
“Unproductive tax breaks that favor corporations and wealthy Ohioans have riddled the state tax code for years,” the report said. 
At more than $8 billion a year, the state’s biggest cuts are those to businesses. 
The biggest single tax break — costing $2.5 billion a year — primarily targets supplies to manufacturers in an attempt to avoid taxing them repeatedly through the process. 
The state seems to have something to show for it. Ohio has the third-most manufacturing jobs in the U.S., and the sixth-most per 100,000 residents. 
However, other such tax breaks have long raised questions. One is the LLC tax break, which costs nearly $1 billion a year. Sold in 2013 as a way to spur job creation, it greatly limits taxes on income run through limited liability companies. 
“Wealthy individuals benefit most from the LLC loophole,” the Policy Matters report said. “In (fiscal year) 2023, a majority of filers claiming the deduction claimed less than $20,000 and received 6.9% of the total value of such deductions. Meanwhile, the 8.3% of filers who claimed $240,000 or more received 41.1% of the deductions.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe state has given up billions in revenue on that deduction and paying for the private agency JobsOhio on promises they would supercharge the job market to everyone’s benefit. But more than 25% of Ohioans are poor enough to be on Medicaid, and the state has consistently ranked in the top 10 in unemployment this year. 
Ohio also lags in a broader economic sense. Last year it ranked 28th in terms of per-capita gross domestic product.
That might mean that other business breaks also aren’t helping most Ohioans.
Unlike most states, Ohio has no tax on corporate profits. It taxes gross receipts under its “Commercial Activity Tax” instead.
In 2023, the legislature raised the threshold at which companies had to start paying it from $1 million a year to $6 million, and it eliminated certain minimum payments. Since most businesses were already paying the minimum $150 a year, more than half the benefit of the higher threshold went to businesses large enough to take in more than $6 million annually.
That tax break costs the state $1.5 billion a year, the Policy Matters report said. The increased thresholds will grow the fastest of any over the next two years, it added.
The report also faulted Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing a measure in the state budget that would have stopped new data centers from getting tax exemptions. Such centers employ few people, and they’re being blamed for rapid increases in Ohioans’ electricity bills.
“The sales tax exemption for data centers, one of the state’s fast-growing tax breaks, will be worth $289.9 million over the FY 2026-27 biennium, according to the Tax Expenditure Report, and probably a lot more if more recently announced investments were included,” JobsOhio researchers wrote. “In many cases, the exemption amounts to as much as $1 million for each data-center job created.”
The tax breaks persist even as lawmakers plead poverty when it comes to funding public education. Abandoning an earlier commitment to pony up at least $666 million more for education over the next two years, the budget DeWine signed slashed that amount by about two-thirds. Meanwhile, the legislature found $600 million to help the billionaire owners of the Cleveland Browns build a new stadium outside the city.
The Policy Matters Ohio report said the legislature opted to look past evidence that some tax breaks weren’t performing as promised. In 2016, the General Assembly passed a bipartisan bill to create a Tax Expenditure Review Committee.
“However, lawmakers found living up to the promise of good government harder than anticipated,” the report said. “They eliminated the (review committee) in the 2022-23 budget bill, after a weak review of 15 sales-tax breaks and failing to carry out its mandates at all in the 2020-21 budget period.”
That and other factors mean that once tax breaks are signed into law, reform is “excruciatingly difficult,” the report said.

The U.S. does not have a big enough power grid to accommodate rising energy demand — a fact that’s making electricity less affordable and reliable nationwide.
But there’s broad public support for growing the grid and allowing more electricity, including cheap, clean energy, to come online.


So says a new survey of likely voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania — two states in the severely backlogged PJM Interconnection grid region — and Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, which are covered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The survey was conducted by polling firm Cygnal on behalf of the Conservative Energy Network.


Roughly three-fourths of likely voters support expanding the electric grid, the survey found. About two-thirds are in favor of adding more transmission lines to connect clean energy and strengthen grid reliability.


And nearly 90% of respondents are concerned about rising energy costs. A majority of surveyed Republicans, Democrats, and Independents said they are ​“very concerned.”


“This is not a partisan issue. … You don’t have to appeal to one side or another,” said Chris Lane, a senior partner at Cygnal, who previewed the findings at the National Conservative Energy Summit in Cleveland on Aug. 25.


He noted that the results stand out for their consistency between regions and among different groups — including political parties. Even so, the Trump administration has in recent months worked against grid expansion, not toward it.


 Adding more ​“lanes” to the grid

Energy costs are climbing in part because of rising power demand from data centers and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Bringing more electricity generation online — especially quick-to-build, low-cost wind and solar — could increase competition and lower prices under the basic principles of supply and demand.


But just as transportation planners need to make sure highways can handle increased road traffic, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission operators need to make sure the grid has room for more electrons. That calls for more ​“lanes” in the form of added transmission lines, plus technologies to squeeze more capacity out of the system overall.


SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCurrently, ​“there aren’t enough power lines, they’re not all in the right places, and the ones we have are too outdated to meet the rising power demand for electricity,” Evelyn Robinson, director of PJM affairs for the renewable-energy industry group MAREC Action, said during a separate panel at the conference in Cleveland.


While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”


Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”


But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.


The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.


 What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.


“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.


The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.


Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.


Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.


Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.


Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.


Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas.
With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Here’s one guarantee from Kansas Reflector: We’re not soaked in drugs and sent through the mail.
That’s the curious claim made by the state Department of Corrections after it decided to cancel all print newspaper subscriptions purchased for inmates by outside parties. That’s right — state officials believe that your hometown gazette is at risk of being infused in a mind-altering substance and carried by the Postal Service. Publishers and the Kansas Press Association have protested mightily, but the department has refused to offer any specifics about the supposed threat.
As I said, a good reason to turn to the all-digital Kansas Reflector. The only mind-altering substance we’re infused with is great reporting and community commentary. If you really want to taint us with drugs in some way, I suppose you can print out some of our stories and do so in the privacy of your own home.
If it sounds like I’m not taking these stories from the state seriously, that’s because I’m not.
Kansas Reflector reporter Anna Kaminski wrote about the change Sept. 8: “Previously, families of incarcerated people could take out a newspaper subscription in a person’s name and have it delivered to a state facility. The agency says it made the change, forbidding newspaper subscriptions paid for by outside parties, for safety. … The new policy requires people serving time in state facilities to request a subscription on their own, undergo an approval process and pay for the subscription out of their commissary accounts.”
After that initial story was published, prison spokesman David Thompson wrote in an email to Kaminski: “The impetus for this policy is an increase in drug-soaked material, such as books and newspapers, being transmitted to residents through the USPS.”
The department provided no evidence that this had happened in Kansas.
Let’s consider for a moment what it would mean for newspapers to actually pose such a threat. What is the corrections department actually suggesting? It seems to me one of two astonishingly improbable scenarios.
First off, it suspects that a newspaper publisher somewhere in the Sunflower State actually has been coating his or her publication with drugs and sending it through the mail. It’s already tough enough making ends meet in this business. Why would owners and operators of local papers open themselves up to such threats?
Secondly, they think that the mail has somehow been intercepted along its path from publisher to prison. That would be a federal crime. And while I understand that legal ramifications don’t deter everyone, surely these canny drug smugglers would want to spread drugs on more durable paper than newsprint. Have you ever tried to even wrap a mug in newspaper? It’s not that durable!
The final and wildest part of all this is that the actual restriction doesn’t fit the supposed risk.
Kansas has forbidden friends and family from buying inmates newspaper subscriptions. But inmates themselves can still purchase the subscriptions. So if the infrastructure already exists to ship newspapers-as-drugs into prisons, the only thing that needs to change is the person actually buying the subscription (and perhaps the prison’s approval process, however that works).
Here’s the bottom line. Prisons and those who run them want control over their institutions and inmates. Contact with the outside world — be it mail, visits or internet — poses potential risks to inmate and staff safety. Officials want to lower those potential risks.
That makes sense. But it can lead to ridiculous situations like this one, where the action taken doesn’t lead to the stated goals and make no sense besides.
Believe me, we wanted to hear more from the state about this. Kaminski and others at Kansas Reflector and the Kansas Press Association have sought extra information and explanations. We would be happy to understand more about officials’ thinking and share it with our readers. Perhaps my absurd scenarios aren’t so absurd after all.
But they have refused to do so. We’re left with a ham-fisted restriction on the free access to information. That leaves all of us, not just prisoners, worse off.

(Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)Amid the recent roiling seas of public murder and on-purpose mayhem came the news that film star Robert Redford had died at 89. As one among millions who enjoyed his movies — whether acting or directing — I have always been especially struck by Redford’s persona … his off-screen character.
Or, more to the point, struck by the contrast between his persona and what we see too much these days on multiple screens.
A caution: Drawing conclusions about actors can be tricky. Their storytelling universe depends on make believe. That reality, however, should neither diminish the message of their films nor paint thespians and the stories they tell with a broad brush, regardless of genre.
Still, exploring Redford’s life, what he valued and with whom he surrounded himself, reveals a fairly clear picture. Of particular interest were the observations of those closest to him both inside and outside the movie business. 
What emerged off the screen, without the patina and greasepaint of such legendary characters as Roy Hobbs and Butch Cassidy, the notoriety of Bob Woodward or his many other memorable roles in a lengthy career, was an intelligent, passionate, unassuming and polite grownup. 
So the news that he had passed gave me pause for more than the loss of a gifted artist with a long and distinguished body of work. We coulduse more examples of his quiet, powerful persona. In a field where success is often measured by the size and duration of the spotlight, he seemed to neither seek nor relish its glow, which is antithetical to a world where likes, retweets and influencers are commodities by which we calculate importance.    
That said, Redford was no modern Marlboro Man or a fence-riding desperado avoiding the public. He was, after all, an actor, whose work is consumed by the public — making him a public figure. Yet, when he could afford to leave the concrete and cacophony of Hollywood, he made Utah his home, far from the freeways and frenzy of his native Southern California. 
Nor was he reclusive … or silent. Instead, in addition to his professional life and his establishing of the Sundance Institute for independent filmmakers, Redford chose social activism, especially environmental causes, issues facing Indigenous people and the plight of the LGBTQ+ community. 
Redford led successful campaigns against a power plant in Utah and a six-lane highway that would have spoiled a canyon area near his home. He lobbied Congress to pass the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. At the time of his death, he had been a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council for over 50 years.
The upheaval and angst of the last couple weeks are at once disheartening and instructive. We watched as screaming, yelling and blaming have continued apace about everything from secret files to murderous motives to unhinged hatred. We learned that constitutionally protected speech apparently ends before late-night television begins. 
Many have gasped when experts — you remember experts, those in a particular field with advanced educations, considerable experience and the respect of their peers — reported that public health decisions were being based on poor science or worse, none. We stared in disbelief as some leaders argued for  governmental stamps of approval on thought and speech.
The result is undeniable. Many of the world’s rounded corners have become sharp, unforgiving to those who bump against them. As we approach 250 years as a nation, nearly six in ten Americans hold pessimistic views of the future, according to data from the Pew Research Center. 
When a general unease about tomorrow is afoot, you can never have too many real adults in the room. Redford’s passing means one fewer.
He once said, “… in keeping diversity alive, it will help keep our industry alive. To be able to be part of a freedom of expression that allows us as artists to tell our stories in our own way about the human condition, the complexities of life, the world around us, is a gift, and not one to be taken lightly.”
He spoke those words in 2002, when the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences awarded him an Honorary Oscar for prompting and supporting independent filmmaking. Their metaphorical underpinning, however, defies today’s frightening move away from diversified thought and expression and toward some monolithic political viewpoint. 
Robert Redford was a movie star. Perhaps his brightest light, however, illuminated and embraced his defense of art, the environment and the freedom to express one’s self and — especially — his character in doing so.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)“For just as weakness is a disease of the body, so wickedness is a disease of the mind.”  — Boethius, “The Consolation of Philosophy”
Usually, politicians will bloviate during campaigns about all the wonderful, transformative things they’ll do if voted into office. Most fall far short of their promises; others use smoke-and-mirrors or sleight-of-hand to distract the public from their shortcomings.
But in Donald Trump’s case, in the early days of his second term, he has used a raft of executive orders, staffing shifts, and slashed budgets to disassemble parts of the federal government, including entire agencies. He has concentrated on significantly reducing the federal workforce and deleting regulatory agencies.
He has been making good on his vow to deport 1 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. Even before he assumed office, Trump and a coterie of far-right billionaires, bigots, kooks, and shadowy entities began building the framework to make this nightmare real.
Gov. Ron DeSantis built one concentration camp deep in the Florida Everglades and just opened another at the closed Baker Correctional Institution. It now holds 117 people but has the capacity to hold 1,500, according to DeSantis administration officials. The site is about 45 miles west of Jacksonville near the Osceola National Forest.
CNN says DeSantis is “doubling down” on his plans to build a third detention site in Florida’s Panhandle, which he has dubbed “Panhandle Pokey,” along with another facility at a Florida National Guard training center known as Camp Blanding, about 30 miles southwest of Jacksonville.
Other states are jumping on the bandwagon with other proposed immigration facilities, including Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer” and Louisiana’s “Camp 57,” located at Angola Prison farm, an 18,000-acre plantation sitting an hour north of Baton Rouge.
Trump and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller have successfully linked immigration with crime and we are watching dragnets in Florida cities and across the country with untold numbers of undocumented and legal immigrants being swept up.
But Trump couldn’t do this alone. Much like Mao Tse Tung, Pol Pot, Benjamin Netanyahu, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, or Leopold II of Belgium, a whole bunch of people need to sign onto your vision and they must be willing to build the legal, ideological, and logistical infrastructure needed to pull this off.
That’s where Ron DeSantis comes in. On this issue, DeSantis is an eager underling, working since June in concert with the Trump administration. He, Attorney General James Uthmeier, and others have embarked on an unprincipled, sadistic crusade of indiscriminately disappearing, imprisoning, and deporting Latino, Black, and Brown immigrants.
The Trump and DeSantis administrations lacked legal authority to do what they’ve been doing, but they have bent laws and ignored precedent and norms to trample on immigrants’ rights.
Domination
It becomes clearer by the day that the imposition of white domination, power, and control of the state and the country animates everything DeSantis and Trump are doing.
DeSantis has fervently signed on to the MAGA Republican white nationalist project of dragging the United States back to a time when European Americans ruled the roost using brute force; murder; laws, customs and norms; and terrorism and fear to intimidate and control African Americans.
Florida has served as the petri dish for DeSantis and his enablers to roll out the far-right agenda and gauge the public response or acceptance of these policies. Whether it’s banning books, laws seeking to curb or erase gay and trans individuals, anti-Black and anti-DEI bias, whitewashing facts, rewriting history, and attacking African Americans and other marginalized groups.
We are witnessing American apartheid, with the use of a range of mechanisms to more fully marginalize those who DeSantis and Trump deem “the other.” As the ACLU reminds us, DeSantis has joined Trump in amplifying already strained racial tensions in the United States. Both have been brazen in their overt quest to weaponize anger, resentment, and racial grievance.
Political content producer Danielle Moodie notes that Trump, Brett Kavanaugh, and a white nationalist Supreme Court are dismantling democracy, civil rights, and America’s economy.
“Isn’t it remarkable how the Supreme Court can rule in one breath that race cannot be considered in college admissions — stripping away affirmative action — and in the next, empower ICE to racially profile, detain, and harass Latinos simply for speaking Spanish in Los Angeles?” Moodie asks. “This hypocrisy reveals a troubling truth: The Court claims to be color-blind when protecting opportunity, yet suddenly sees race when it comes to criminalization, detention, and fear.”
Moodie added: “This contradiction is not just a legal nuance. It is a reflection of how deeply embedded white supremacy remains within our institutions. And under Donald Trump’s leadership, aided by his handpicked justices, the Supreme Court has become less an arbiter of justice and more an enabler of authoritarianism.”
The immediate result: Immigrants — documented and undocumented — are being disappeared by ICE agents without reasonable suspicion. The far-right faction is allowing federal and state law enforcement agents to confront and detain anyone who looks Latino, speaks little or no English, and gathers in certain places where Latinos congregate.
This blessing granted by the high court of racial profiling allows gangs of ICE, Border Patrol, Homeland Security, ATF, and others to hunt down immigrants, the vast majority of whom have committed no crime.
Moodie notes that the Supreme Court, its credibility at an all-time low, stripped away affirmative action in higher education; handed presidential immunity to Donald Trump while he faced multiple indictments; and enabled a wave of anti-immigrant policies that echo the darkest chapters of American history.
“Chief Justice John Roberts will likely be remembered not as a guardian of the Constitution, but as the leader who rolled back a century of progress on civil rights,” she said.
Theatrics
Critics including James Greenberg, emeritus professor of anthropology at The University of Arizona, have been warning about the authoritarian path that DeSantis and MAGA Republicans elsewhere are laying out. They mean to stoke fear and compel compliance.
“These theatrics work like rituals. Military vehicles rumble through desert towns, children in cages, recruitment ads with warriors silhouetted against flags  — all ceremonies of fear,” Greenberg said. “They draw sharp lines of belonging and exclusion, marking who belongs and who is cast out. Raids at dawn, walls built for cameras, soldiers posing for photo ops are repeated gestures that turn cruelty into liturgy, weaving it into civic life until it looks ordinary.”
“Power has left marks on the land and surveillance has become a terrain of expansion,” Greenberg added.
“Tools once built to track foreign terrorists now target immigrants, activists, journalists, even civil servants. Private tech firms fused with federal agencies, creating databases that sweep up social media posts, license plate scans, phone metadata, and travel patterns,” he said. “These systems persist without oversight. Algorithms flag ‘suspicious behavior’ that often means nothing more than speaking out, worshiping differently, or crossing paths with the wrong people.”
Those who resist are surveilled by drones, have their phones and laptops searched at airports and border crossings.
“The effect is not only to collect data but to intimidate, to show people they are always visible. Surveillance has become a system of control, a constant warning that belonging can be questioned at any time,” said Greenberg.
“Detention has followed the same logic. Private prison companies, once in retreat, under Trump found new life. Contracts multiplied, decommissioned facilities reopened, tent cities sprouted in remote deserts. These sites were deliberately hard to reach, far from lawyers and reporters. Images of overcrowded cells and children behind fences remain etched in memory as proof of how cruelty is normalized.”
In total, detention “has always been as much spectacle as policy, a ritual of exclusion designed to instill fear before it processes anyone,” he continued.
“Inside, migrants are fingerprinted, DNA-tested, and placed in systems that reduce human beings to biometric codes. What looks like confinement is both political theater and an extraction of data and profits,” Greenberg said.
“Family separation reveals the cruelty in its starkest form. Parents deported without their children. By severing the most basic bonds of belonging, the state redefined what it means to be part of the nation. Citizenship papers could not shield children from being rendered effectively stateless if their parents were removed. Belonging is treated as a privilege that can be revoked at will.”
The deeper truth, Greenberg warns, is that repression relies on infrastructure.
“Prisons, surveillance grids, militarized zones — once built, rarely vanish. They remain in place for whoever comes next,” he said. “Like irrigation canals dug centuries ago, they channel flows of power long after their builders are gone. Trump accelerated this process, turning the latent into the active, the possible into the real.”
Depending on who you ask, there are those who believe that it’s already too late to reverse what DeSantis, Trump, the orchestrators of Project 2025, and MAGA Republicans are doing, while others believe America still has time.
Regardless of where you stand, what are we prepared to do to dismantle this architecture of tyranny?

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-22 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"After Bridgeport, why no ballot reform?",Peter A. Thalheim,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/22/no-legislative-fix-for-bridgeports-absentee-ballot-scandal/,Our Democratic Party of Connecticut has been benefiting from a corrupt Bridgeport balloting for decades which is why election reform is unlikely.,"Andrew Brown of the Connecticut Mirror posed a poignant question in his June 26 piece reporting that Bridgeport elections scandals fail to inspire new laws. 
How is it that with “seven political operatives, campaign workers and elected officials currently facing charges for allegedly manipulating Bridgeport’s absentee voting system” no pieces of legislation to end a long string of election-related crime in Bridgeport made it into law in Connecticut in 2025?
The answer is because Connecticut is dirty. You don’t even have to show a government issued photo ID like a Connecticut driver’s license or non-driver photo identification card to vote, even though the vast majority of Americans support just such a requirement, across all races and ethnicities.
But that would make it harder for the Democratic Party of Connecticut to have people cheat on its behalf. Of the seven political operatives presently facing charges, five are associated with the Bridgeport Democratic Party. More than 150 charges have been filed according to Brown’s article on the “most significant criminal prosecution of election-related crime in Connecticut history.” It should be noted that all criminal defendants are innocent until proven guilty or they admit to a criminal charge.
According to the Chief State’s Attorney’s office, the charges include absentee voting irregularities, forged signatures, registering non-citizens to vote, illegally telling people how to vote, changing votes after they were cast and harvesting ballots to deliver to ballot drop boxes. The poster child for this whole nest of corruption is alleged to be Wanda Geter-Pataky, vice-chair of the Bridgeport Democratic Party.
But do not lose sight of why this corruption exists in Bridgeport. It benefits the Connecticut Democratic Party statewide! 
The more votes the Bridgeport Democratic Party can manufacture and send to Hartford, the better the election outcome for Democrats in statewide contests and in the 4th U.S. Congressional district. The Democrats control the five constitutional offices of governor (Ned Lamont), lieutenant governor (Susan Bysiewicz), attorney general (William Tong), secretary of state (Stephanie Thomas) and treasurer (Erick Russell). They also hold the two U.S. senate seats in Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal as well as the 4th U.S. Congressional District (Jim Himes).
Our Democratic Party of Connecticut has been benefiting from a corrupt Bridgeport for decades and it has no intention of stopping the voting scandals, which is why election reform is unlikely. 
Our Democrat Party has made a deal with the devil. In Goethe’s Faust, Dr. Faust is offered help by Mephistopheles, the Devil, to know, in a Biblical sense, the young maiden Gretchen. In exchange, Faust bets Mephistopheles that Mephistopheles can never make Faust so content that he will wish that moment to last forever.
The deal that our Democrat Party has made is that the Democratic Party of Bridgeport can abuse the election rights and expectations of Bridgeport residents to maintain the dominance of the Bridgeport Democratic Party over Bridgeport in exchange for the Bridgeport Democrats producing as many Democrat votes as they can as Connecticut’s largest city to elect Democrats statewide, the two U.S. senators and in the 4th U.S. Congressional District.
One result of this deal with the devil is one of the slowest state economies of all 50 states! Connecticut was one of the last states to regain the jobs lost in the 2008-2009 Great Recession in 2024. We are saddled with a corrupt political class.
Housing has been made so expensive to permit and build that it has been put out of reach for young buyers and young families. Connecticut has a high cost of living as well as anemic economic growth. The residents who leave this progressive paradise have a higher education level and more assets than residents who replace them with lower education and assets which is a loss to the entire state.
And who is the personification of this corruption of Bridgeport? In my opinion it is Mayor Joseph Ganim. After serving as mayor from 1991-2003 he was convicted of 16 federal counts in racketeering, extortion, conspiracy, bribery, mail fraud and filing a false tax return. According to Wikipedia, Ganim shook down Bridgeport city contractors for more than half a million dollars in cash, food, wine, clothing, home renovations and diamonds. He was sentenced to nine years in prison and about $475,000 in fines and restitution. He was released in 2010 after seven years in prison.
Part of prison is the concept of redemption and paying for your crime. Based on that Ganim again ran for mayor in 2015 and won. All slates were clear at that point.
I met Ganim twice in the campaign of 2017-18 when I ran for governor. The first time was after I had met with a civil rights advocate in the African American community in 2017 and then in April 2018 when the NAACP of Connecticut sponsored a gubernatorial debate in New Haven on prisoner re-entry into society. Present were candidates Lamont, Bysiewicz, Guy Smith, Ganim and me. My impression of Ganim was of an energetic and positive politician with a gregarious nature that would make you comfortable in his presence.
In 2019, when State Sen. Marilyn Moore opposed Mayor Ganim in the Bridgeport Democratic primary for mayor, Moore beat Ganim in the city’s voting booths, but she lost because of the city’s absentee ballots. How convenient for Mayor Ganim.
So here we are in 2025. Bridgeport Democrat Party operatives and members are charged with election fraud, complete with videos that appear to show ballot box stuffing. Again, all individuals are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
But the Connecticut legislature, controlled by Democrats, and the governor, a Democrat, have done nothing to clean this rot.
And so Connecticut will continue to be at the bottom of economic performance of the 50 states in growth as the pain of progressive policies continue to drown the state.
Andrew Brown: To answer your cogent question: no legislation tightening up against the election fraud alleged in Bridgeport happened in Hartford this year because Connecticut is a dirty state. 
Never say never, however, as even Dr. Faust changed course and with the intercession of Gretchen, whom he had betrayed, his soul was redeemed.

On his show last week, Kimmel said that Trump’s supporters were “desperately trying” to paint Tyler Robinson (the alleged assassin) “as anything other than one of them.”
Anyone who follows the news and monitors social media will conclude that Kimmel’s statement was largely accurate. Indeed, many in the Trump administration including the vice president went out of their way to suggest that a radical network of left-wing extremists was behind the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk even as this claim stood in contrast to the evidence presented by law enforcement.
ABC’s suspension of the Jimmy Kimmel show came right after Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission chairman, threatened in an interview that he would consider punishing the local stations that carried Kimmel’s show. Carr’s comments were swiftly followed by announcements from several stations with ABC affiliates that they would move to cancel Kimmel’s show.
In the wake of the Charlie Kirk murder, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested that the Justice Department would target groups and individuals that were employing hate speech. When reporters pointed out to Bondi that hate speech is generally protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution, she seemed to walk back some of her initial comments. Nonetheless, by then the Trump Administration’s threatening message was resonating.
The canceling of the Jimmy Kimmel show is nothing less than a cynical attack on one of the most sacred liberties in a democracy—the freedom of speech and expression. Trump applauded this canceling in a tweet, ironically negating his own remarks from the second inaugural address in January 2025 when he vowed to “immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.”

An excerpt from President Donald Trump’s January 20 inaugural address.
Yet even more troubling than the attack on free speech by the Trump administration is the culture of fear and intimidation that they have created since coming into office nine months ago. Earlier this week, President Trump filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times and book publisher Penguin Random House. The lawsuit focuses on a book about Trump by two New York Times reporters and three “false, malicious, defamatory, and disparaging” articles that he says were aimed at sabotaging his chances in the 2024 presidential election.
The suit was dismissed last Friday by a federal court judge, but a report by PBS observes that “Trump has filed lawsuits against outlets whose coverage he dislikes, threatened to revoke TV broadcast licenses and sought to bend news organizations and social media companies to his will.” Such tactics are akin to those used by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and are aimed at chipping away at political freedoms and independent media while consolidating power.
An independent media is not the only institution that has been targeted by the second Trump administration. Upon assuming office in January, one of the first actions of this administration was to withhold research funding and exert tremendous political pressures on major universities like Columbia and Harvard.
Columbia, the first to capitulate to the demands of the Trump Administration, agreed in March to overhaul its protest policies, security practices and Middle Eastern studies department. In the case of Harvard, the government insisted that it change hiring and admissions in departments that “lack viewpoint diversity” and “immediately shutter” any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion. Even if one agrees with some of the demands of the Trump Administration, the tactics they are using to secure compliance are not consistent with dialogue and negotiation, which is how healthy democratic societies pursue change.
We should also remember the executive order signed by Trump, which targeted prestigious law firms like Paul Weiss for conducting work or hiring lawyers that the White House disfavors. Weiss ultimately reached a deal with the administration that enabled the firm to get out from the penalties imposed by the order. According to an article in Politico, “eight firms followed that precedent in order to avoid becoming targeted themselves, ultimately committing a combined total of nearly $1 billion in pro bono legal services to largely unspecified initiatives supported by the Trump administration.”
Taken together, the actions of the Trump Administration amount to much more than bullying a network to cancel a late-night talk show or censoring the negative coverage that the President is receiving. What is at stake here is a concerted effort to establish a culture of fear and intimidation, one in which media organizations, non-profits, and ordinary citizens must think twice about critiquing and challenging the government.
 As we approach the 250th anniversary of the American experiment in democracy, we should remember that our founders called on us to vigorously resist any efforts to curtail our fundamental rights and liberties.

A single historical example or a set number of victims does not define genocide. Instead, “Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent” –inferred or explicit- “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such:

Killing members of the group;
Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”

Braffman’s effort to minimize Israel’s crimes finds no support in fact or law. But don’t take our word for it, listen to world experts.  Early on in Israel’s assault on Gaza, more than 800 scholars and practitioners of international law and genocide studies signed a public statement “to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.” Such concern arose not only from Israel’s ruthless bombing of civilians but from the many statements of genocidal intent spewing from Israeli leaders. 
The International Court of Justice’s interim ruling in January 2024 ordered Israel to prevent genocide, punish incitement to genocide, and enable provisions of basic services and humanitarian assistance to reach Gaza. In March 2024, the ICJ further ordered Israel to stop the invasion of Rafah and to reopen the Rafah crossing to humanitarian aid deliveries. But Israel ignored these provisional measures.
Amnesty International issued a report in December 2024 that “Israel has carried out acts prohibited under the Genocide Convention, with the specific intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza.” Likewise, Human Rights Watch concluded that “Israeli authorities” were “responsible for the crime against humanity of extermination and for acts of genocide. Professor Omar Bartov, who had previously served in the Israeli Defense Force, reached the “inescapable conclusion” in July 2025 that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. In July, B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization recognized that “the Israeli regime is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip.” 
The International Association of Genocide Scholars declared  on August 31, 2025, that “Israel’s policies and actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide.” On September 16, the United Nations’ Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory published a report that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since October 17, 2023.
Each day, Israel starves Palestinian children and murders and maims more civilians with the Trump administration’s support. On September 18, the U.S. cast its sixth veto on a U.N. Security Council resolution concerning a Gaza ceasefire. A report issued by Brown University’s Cost of War Project estimates that in the one year ending September 30, 2024, the U.S. government provided $22.76 billion in military-related aid to Israel. 
Just before leaving office, the Biden administration notified Congress of additional munitions sales totaling $8 billion that the Trump administration subsequently approved. In February 2025, the State Department approved $6.75 billion in munitions sales, including 500-pound bombs. A missile sales package, valued at $660 million, was also approved in February 2025. In July 2025, the State Department approved $510 million sale of Joint Direct Attack Munitions.
As of September 2025, the confirmed death toll in Gaza surpassed 65,000, including more than 20,000 children and 1,000 babies under one year old.  Even though 84% of the American electorate favors an immediate ceasefire, Congress, in contravention of the Leahy Law, continues its unconditional support for Israel.  
Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut joined with Republicans in July in opposing the Joint Resolutions of Disapproval that would limit certain weapons to Israel, supported by 27 senators, including Sen. Chris Murphy. Thus far, U.S. Reps. John Larson, Joe Courtney, Rosa DeLauro, Jim Himes, and Jahana Hayes have refused to unite with 49 congressional Democrats to co-sponsor H.R. 3565 to ban weapons to Israel. 
We guess that Elaine Braffman is quite happy with that result. But as for us, and most of the Connecticut electorate, we do not want our government and tax dollars supporting Israel’s Gaza genocide.

Interspersed in his comments about Kirk, Trump aimed insults at what he described as “radical left lunatics,” promoted his anti-crime campaign and teased a forthcoming announcement from the administration regarding autism. Vance spoke about his friendship with Kirk and attributed the electorate’s swing to conservatism to Kirk’s outreach, saying Kirk “changed the course of American history.”Vance joined Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi in recent days calling for consequences for Americans who criticized Kirk following his death. During his remarks at the memorial, Vance said he saw “the very worst parts of humanity” in comments and social media posts.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recounted meeting Kirk a decade ago when “he was building a movement.”“I still have this sticker (that reads) ‘Big Government Sucks,’” Hegseth said, recalling an early campaign slogan for Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk co-founded in 2012.Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, said those devoted to Kirk will “defeat the forces of darkness and evil.”“You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk. You made him immortal,” Miller said.Kirk’s wife Erika Kirk confirmed she will now sit at the helm of Turning Point USA as the nonprofit’s CEO after several speakers who heralded the organization’s future alluded to the change.In an emotional speech, she told those in attendance that she has forgiven the suspected shooter.“I forgive him because it was what Christ did. It is what Charlie would do, the answer to hate is not hate,” Erika Kirk said. During his remarks, Trump jokingly apologized to Erika because he said he “can’t stand” his opponents.Kirk “did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That’s where I disagreed with him. I hate my opponents and don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry, Erika,” Trump said.Musk, members of Congress in attendanceThe memorial service began at 11 a.m. Mountain time at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, which seats upwards of 60,000.A large painting of Kirk, who was fatally shot 11 days ago at age 31, was displayed on stage. Large LED screens played videos and displayed photos of the activist, who was very influential among Republicans and conservatives.A seven-piece band backed Christian singer Chris Tomlin as Trump administration officials walked onto the floor of the stadium. Cameras captured the entrances of Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. All delivered speeches.Billionaire Elon Musk, a major donor to Trump’s 2024 campaign and the former leader of Trump’s government efficiency project, entered the stadium to cheers, according to CNN. Cameras caught Trump and Musk shaking hands and apparently speaking while seated together prior to Trump’s remarks.Current and former U.S. senators and representatives were among members of the audience, including former Florida U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz. A U.S. military color guard displayed flags during the national anthem.The memorial service was livestreamed and is available on C-SPAN.Journalists outside the stadium reported thousands of people lining up early hoping to attend the ceremony. Kirk was fatally shot by a suspected lone gunman on Sept. 10 while he was speaking at Utah Valley University, according to authorities, who are seeking the death penalty. NBC reported Saturday that law enforcement officials have not found any link between Kirk’s shooting and left-wing groups.Utah native Tyler Robinson, 22, is charged on seven counts, including aggravated murder, violent offense in the presence of a child and witness tampering. Authorities say Robinson sent text messages about “hatred” to his roommate following the shooting. Charging documents say Robinson’s parents recounted their son’s recent interest in LGBTQ rights and that he had started to “lean more to the left.”Charlie Kirk called a ‘martyr’Speakers praised Kirk’s work and at numerous points during the ceremony referred to him as a “martyr” for the conservative movement and Christianity.Far-right YouTube commentator Benny Johnson referred to Kirk’s “revival spirit” and influence in spreading a Christian worldview.“Charlie Kirk is a martyr in the true Christian tradition. You take out a tyrant, his power goes away. You cut down a martyr, his power grows,” Johnson said.Johnson called out Trump administration officials in the crowd as “rulers of our land.”  “May we pray that our rulers here, rightfully instituted and given power by our God, wield the sword for the terror of evil men in our nation, in Charlie's memory. I want to live in a country where the evil are terrified, and where the good and the faithful and the moral people of our nation can live in peace, debate in peace, disagree in peace and start families in peace.”GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida said she owed her political career to Kirk, who hired her to do outreach to young Hispanic voters.“These were the sparks that lit the path for me on the eve of my departure to medical school to decide to change course and join TP USA, where I could help Charlie battle the socialist indoctrination on college campuses,” Luna said.The U.S. House passed a resolution Friday honoring Kirk, supported by all Republicans and 95 Democrats.Presidents and memorial servicesIt is notable for a sitting president, vice president and multiple Cabinet members to deliver remarks at a memorial service for a private citizen. Trump ordered flags lowered after Kirk’s death.Trump spoke, along with Republican congressional leaders, at the U.S. Capitol in 2018 at a memorial for the late evangelist Billy Graham, who had relationships with U.S. presidents going back decades, with Graham lying in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. Trump ordered flags at half-staff.President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy for the nine victims of the racially motivated mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Notably, Obama spontaneously sang “Amazing Grace.” Obama did not order flags lowered following the massacre.Kirk maintained professor watch list, hosted podcastKirk was born in 1993 in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights.He co-founded Turning Point USA aiming to mobilize conservative youth and young adults on high school and college campuses. Kirk toured campuses across the U.S. speaking on contemporary hard-right topics, including anti-LGBTQ positions and encouraging young women to retreat from careers and return to the home. Among the organization’s projects was the “Professor Watchlist” that published the names of professors across the country in searchable format by categories including “anti-Christian views,” “feminism,” “climate alarmist” and “racial ideology,” according to its web page.Kirk hosted “The Charlie Kirk Show,” a successful daily radio show and podcast. Devoting an entire episode in July to the Jeffrey Epstein case, Kirk was among those in Trump’s voter base to urge the president to release more information about the federal investigation into the late financier and convicted sex offender.  Kirk’s work garnered attention beyond the United States. Rev. Rob McCoy, Kirk’s pastor, recounted a recent trip to South Korea “Charlie looked at politics as an on-ramp to Jesus,” McCoy told the crowd.Turning Point USA Inc., which has been tax exempt since 2014, reported $84.9 million in revenue in 2024, according to the organization’s publicly available 990 tax forms published on ProPublica’s Nonprofit Explorer.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-21 19:56:55.778071
,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-09-21 22:27:07+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,Pa. GOP endorses Garrity for governor. What’s next in the 2026 race?,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/pa-gop-endorses-garrity-for-governor-whats-next-in-the-2026-race/,The state party didn’t endorse a candidate for lieutenant governor.,"Stacy Garrity, Pennsylvania’s 78th treasurer, delivers her inaugural address Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025, at The Forum Auditorium in Harrisburg, Pa., kicking off her second term in office. (Commonwealth Media Services)The Pennsylvania Republican Party endorsed state Treasurer Stacy Garrity in the 2026 race for governor during its fall state committee meeting in State College over the weekend.
Garrity, the only candidate nominated on the floor, was approved by a voice vote. A significant majority said “aye” in their support, while there were just a few ‘no’s’ in the crowd when asked if the party should endorse her in the race.
During her acceptance speech, Garrity highlighted her small town roots in Bradford County, plus her experience as a combat veteran and elected official as reasons why she’s positioned to take on incumbent Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro next year.
“While Josh Shapiro has taken more and more of your money, my office has returned more than a billion dollars to its rightful owners,” she said. “Rather than empowering bureaucracy to stop progress, we created Pennsylvania Money Match, removing red tape, and returning more than $40 million to Pennsylvania taxpayers.”
“And that is the fundamental contrast in this race,” she added. “While Josh Shapiro seeks to take more from you, I am running for governor to give back.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Garrity was first elected as state treasurer in 2020 after defeating incumbent Democrat Joe Torsella by just under one point. Her victory over the Montgomery County Democrat was seen as an upset and then she cruised to reelection in 2024.
Garrity claimed that Shapiro’s GSD “get stuff done” phrase is all talk and criticized his administration on a variety of policy issues including energy, crime, and education.
“Let’s be clear, Josh Shapiro has one priority, and it’s not you,” Garrity said. “Josh Shapiro’s priority is Josh Shapiro and the contrast between us could not be clearer.”
Garrity also stated that she’s not running for governor “as a stepping stone to something bigger,” a not-so-veiled jab at Shapiro for his reported interest in potentially running for president in 2028.
“My message to families all across our great commonwealth: help is on the way,” Garrity said. “And with your help, we’ll make Pennsylvania a safer, a stronger and a more prosperous place to raise your family and grow your business today and for years to come.”
On Saturday, Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chair Eugene DePasquale issued a statement saying that Garrity has sold out Pennsylvanians every chance she’s gotten and that she couldn’t be trusted in the governor’s office.
“Stacy Garrity has a long track record of views and positions that are wrong for Pennsylvania,” DePasquale wrote.
He criticized Garrity for supporting President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he said will negatively impact health care, energy jobs, and taxes.
“She has long fought for an extreme anti-choice agenda – celebrating the fall of Roe v. Wade and even selling anti-abortion merchandise,” DePasquale wrote.
Since launching her 2026 bid for governor, Politico reports that Garrity has stopped selling the anti-abortion merchandise on her campaign website and said she would not support a state abortion ban if elected, although she avoided directly answering questions about her position on the issue during an interview with Politico in September.
DePasquale also criticized Garrity for speaking at a rally in January 2021 that questioned the integrity of the 2020 election.
Garrity has since walked those comments back.
As the 2026 campaign plays out, Garrity and Shapiro still have to work with one another in their current roles in elected office.
Garrity said her bid for governor hasn’t changed the way she will be working with him.
“This is not personal. I just have a very different vision for our commonwealth,” Garrity told reporters. “It hasn’t changed at all.”
The 2026 general election is over a year away, but a trio of national ratings outlets, the Cook Political Report, Sabato’s Crystal Ball, and Inside Elections, indicate that Shapiro is the favorite, rating the race as “likely Democratic.”
Following the endorsement meeting, Garrity is set to embark on a week-long trip kicking off her campaign, dubbed the “Help is on the Way Tour,” and visit five different regions in the state for rallies.
Each rally will take place in counties that Shapiro won in 2022 over Mastriano. During Garrity’s successful reelection bid in 2024, she won three of those counties – Cumberland, Erie, and Bucks, while losing in more-Democratic friendly Allegheny and Lackawanna counties. 
Will Garrity have a clear path to the nomination?
Although Garrity now has the formal support of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, it does not necessarily mean that she will be the only candidate seeking the nomination.
State Sen. Doug Mastriano, who was the GOP gubernatorial candidate in 2022 and lost to Shapiro by double digits, has been teasing a 2026 run for months through social media posts and interviews.

Mastriano secured the GOP nomination for governor in 2022 during a crowded primary that saw the state party largely stay on the sidelines, while Trump delivered a last-minute endorsement to him.
Mastriano has repeatedly railed against the effort from the state party to endorse a candidate for governor at the fall meeting.
“ I spent 90 minutes with (Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman) Greg Rothman at our house expressing our opposition to an extremely premature endorsement,” Mastriano told WITF in August. “We think it’s a terrible idea and it’ll disenfranchise the grassroots, which we’re part of.”
Mastriano has also said that an endorsement of Garrity would not necessarily deter him from joining the 2026 race.
Rothman told the Capital-Star in an interview in February endorsing candidates early, like the state party did in 2024 for Dave McCormick, can make a “huge difference.”
Garrity echoed a similar sentiment with reporters on Saturday.
“Anytime you can get an early endorsement, it’s fantastic, and I am so honored to have the endorsement and the confidence of the leaders here of our grassroots party,” she said.
Peter Quaglia, a committeeman from Wayne County, noted that Garrity broke the record for most votes earned in an election in state history during her 2024 victory as a reason the party endorsed her.
“I’m personally somebody who’s normally against endorsements, but this is a situation where, not to endorse her would be an abdication of our responsibility to the party,” Quaglia said. “She’s been gift-wrapped for us, basically in terms of somebody to go up against Josh Shapiro.”
Republican state committee members that spoke with the Capital-Star said they were unsure if Mastriano would decide to enter the race. 
How will Trump impact the race?
Garrity and Mastriano are both vocal supporters of President Trump and his administration.
Trump’s endorsements usually hold a lot of weight in GOP primaries in Pennsylvania and beyond.
In 2022, Trump backed Mastriano and Mehmet Oz in their respective primaries for governor and U.S. Senate. Both candidates won the primary, but lost in the general election. 
Trump has not formally announced his support for a candidate in the 2026 Pennsylvania race for governor. 
“I was so honored to campaign with President Trump in 2024 and he and I led the ticket,” Garrity told reporters. “And so I would be honored to get his endorsement.”

“And between now and when I get it, I will be working in all four corners of the great commonwealth to get the endorsement of every voter in Pennsylvania,” she added.
The Pennsylvania Democratic Party is already attempting to link Garrity with Trump in the 2026 race.
“If Stacy Garrity does become the GOP insiders’ pick for governor, they will be making a clear choice: pledging allegiance to a candidate who has pledged her own allegiance to Donald Trump and a dangerous agenda that will hurt the people of Pennsylvania,” DePasquale said. “The voters of the commonwealth know they can’t trust someone like that anywhere near the Governor’s office.”
Trump won the state’s 19 electoral votes in 2024, although recent approval ratings show that the president approval rating dropping in Pennsylvania.
Val Biancaniello, a GOP committeewoman from Delaware County, credited Trump’s message in 2024 for his victory, as well as the GOP’s “Swamp the Vote” strategy, which also encouraged Republicans to vote-by-mail. Although Democrats vote-by-mail in larger numbers, Republicans did increase their share of voting by mail in the 2024 election.
In August, Trump sent out a post on social media that he was going to “lead a movement” to end mail-in voting.
No endorsement for the race for Lt. Gov.
The Pennsylvania Republican Party during Saturday’s meeting decided to push back it’s endorsement in the race for lieutenant governor until their next state committee meeting in 2026.
Garrity declined to say who she wanted to join her on the ticket.
“That process will play out,” Garrity said. “So, we’ll deal with that at the next state committee meeting in February.”

Guy Ciarrocchi, a GOP committeeman in Chester County, believes it is important to have a strong candidate in that race, as well.
“I think the important thing is this last three years has been about showmanship,” he said. “I think Stacy wants to build a ticket where things will get done, where we’ll finally pass budgets on time, where we’ll deal with school choice and empower parents.”

Rand Paul says Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brandon Carr’s criticism of comedian Jimmy Kimmel was “absolutely inappropriate.”
“The FCC was wrong to weigh in. And I’ll fight any — any — attempt by the government to get involved with speech. I will fight,” Paul said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
At the same time, Paul said, “people have to also realize that despicable comments, you have the right to say them, but you don’t have the right to employment.”
 The Kentucky Republican dodged saying anything directly critical of President Donald Trump as host Kristen Welker asked about Trump’s threats to broadcasters’ license over negative coverage of him and the president’s demands over the weekend that Attorney General Pam Bondi criminally prosecute his political enemies.
“I think lawfare in all forms is bad,” said Paul, asserting that Democrats had misused the justice system to unfairly punish Trump when Democrat Joe Biden was president. 
“It’s wrong now. But you have to put it into context also and acknowledge that the king of all lawfare was Biden and the Democrats for four years. What they did to Donald Trump was an abomination. But yes, it is not right for the Trump administration to do the same thing.”
Paul also contended that the Biden administration had engaged in censorship, pressuring social media companies during the pandemic to police content related to COVID-19.
ABC, which is owned by Disney, suspended comedian Kimmel’s late-night show after FCC chairman Carr criticized some of his remarks about the killing of right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk and Trump’s response to it. 
Paul said that he and his wife, Kelly Paul, had spoken at Kirk events, including on college campuses. Kirk was debating with students at a college in Utah when he was fatally wounded. 
Paul said that Kirk stood out from “a lot of the argumentation you see either on TV or on the internet where everybody’s drowning people out” because of his willingness to hear opposing points of view. “He actually would listen to people. So I think he’ll be remembered for that and also being remembered for a guy that was trying to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. And that I think should be applauded.”
With the risk of a government shutdown looming at month’s end if the Senate cannot agree on a temporary spending plan, Paul, a deficit hawk, said, “I’m not going to vote for the Republican plan or the Democrat plan. I think eventually they come together. But typically, the compromise is to make things worse. The compromise through the years is the right gets more military spending, the left gets more welfare spending, and the deficit continues to explode.
“Our debt has been downgraded; our triple A rating has been taken away. There is unrest, and I do believe that we face serious problems as a country if we don’t do something so simple as just start spending what comes in. Balance our budget.”
Paul was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against Trump’s tax and spending bill in July.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado, along with 15 other states, is poised to sue the federal government for ignoring endangered species regulations in a wide range of infrastructure projects on public lands. One of those projects, a controversial proposal to expand an oil shipping facility in Utah, would significantly increase hazardous rail shipments through Colorado.
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, and the attorneys general of the other states provided in a July 18 letter to Trump administration officials a 60-day notice of their intent to sue. The notice expired last week.
The letter cites violations of the Endangered Species Act it says have occurred in pursuit of an executive order, called “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” which President Donald Trump signed on his first day in office in January. 
“The ESA and implementing regulations do not allow agencies to routinely avoid and delay implementation of the ESA’s protections of endangered species and their critical habitats in the manner you have directed and which your agencies are carrying out,” the letter says.

The letter was addressed to Trump, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and the directors of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Marine Fisheries Service.
The letter lists pipeline, cable and mining projects in states from Washington to Illinois — including the Wildcat Loadout Facility Right-of-Way Amendment on U.S. Bureau of Land Management land near Price, Utah — that it says pose risks to listed endangered species or critical habitat for fish and aquatic mammals from rainbow trout to salmon to sturgeon to whales.
The letter says Trump’s executive order declaring an energy emergency to fast-track fossil fuel production, despite record oil production in the United States, “unlawfully directs the (Army) Corps and Interior to bypass legal requirements, including those provided in the ESA. Congress did not authorize agencies to routinely bypass the ESA’s requirements to develop the President’s preferred energy sources.”
Asked if by signing onto the pending endangered species lawsuit, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is signaling he intends to join a separate lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump’s “energy emergency” executive order, a spokesperson for Weiser said that has yet to be determined.
“The notice of intent to sue to enforce the ESA could be a basis for joining the lawsuit challenging the White House energy emergency executive order,” Weiser spokesman Lawrence Pacheco wrote in an email this month. “The attorney general, however, has not made a decision on joining the EO lawsuit.”
Pacheco did not provide additional information on when the endangered species litigation will be filed or how it will be announced.
“We announce all lawsuits that we join or file ourselves,” Pacheco said. “I don’t have any idea on timing.”
Sued by environmental groups
The Wildcat Loadout expansion, as first reported by Newsline in 2023, has been plagued by air quality violations and other matters related to Native American antiquities. It would allow crude oil producers in the Uinta Basin to vastly expand drilling and transportation, including by rail through Colorado. Another proposed project in the basin, the bitterly opposed Uinta Basin Railway, would allow for even greater oil shipments. When the U.S. Supreme Court in late May cleared the way for the 88-mile rail link project, proponents said their next step was “completion of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) process.“
The BLM in early July invoked Trump’s emergency declaration to complete an accelerated environmental review of the permit for the Wildcat facility, which could increase oil capacity on the main rail line through Colorado by up to 80,000 barrels a day. Combined with the expansion of other nearby facilities, it will allow for the trucking and transfer to rail of up to 75% of the oil proposed for the Uinta Basin Railway project.
The railway project, estimated to cost at least $2.4 billion to build, would allow for up to 350,000 barrels of oil per day — more than doubling U.S. oil-by-rail transport — to move in heated oil tankers for 100 miles along the headwaters of the Colorado River, under the Continental Divide at Winter Park and through Denver on their way to refineries along the Gulf Coast. Backers of the project are seeking low-interest U.S. Department of Transportation private activity bonds.
Eagle County and five environmental groups sued to overturn U.S. Surface Transportation Board approval of the railway in 2022. They were initially successfully, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a favorable 2023 federal appellate court decision. Eagle County has long sought more direct state involvement in litigation opposing the project.
In a press release following the Supreme Court ruling, Keith Heaton, director of Utah’s Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, which has been using taxpayer dollars to pursue the railway project, said, “It represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability. We look forward to continuing our work with all stakeholders to deliver this transformative project.”
The coalition is not a sponsor of the Wildcat Loadout project.
Asked for project updates and comment on the pending endangered species litigation, Melissa Cano, director of communications for the Uinta Basin Railway and the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, replied in an email: “At this time, the coalition does not have additional information or updates to provide beyond what has already been made publicly available. What I do wish to stress is that the Uinta Basin Railway Project is moving forward.”

(Photo by Peter Macdiarmid, Getty Images)Armed with new data that show nearly $1 billion was spent on dental emergency room and hospital charges in 2024, a wide coalition of health care advocates is pushing the Legislature to approve a new mid-level dental health care provider known as dental therapists.
Floridians for Dental Access is an effort led by Dr. Frank Catalanotto and it’s got the blessing of House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, who first sponsored the legislation as a freshman legislator. Past attempts have been quashed by the Florida Senate, which has targeted billions on bolstering the state’s health care workforce in recent years but has been unwilling to sign off on the idea.
Rural counties are some of the hardest hit by dental shortages and cost increases with nearly 41% of Florida’s 32 rural counties reporting a 77% increase in dental-related hospital and emergency room billings.
With Senate President Ben Albritton pushing for hundreds of millions in state dollars for rural Florida’s counties and Perez nearing the end of his two-year leadership in the House, Catalanotto says the 2026 session is go time.
“We kinda feel like it’s now or never. It’s gotta be this year,” Catalanotto, a former dean of the University of Florida College of Dentistry, told the Florida Phoenix.
“I can’t be specific about it, but we are working on several approaches to work with the Florida Senate on it. “

Dental therapists are similar to physician assistants. They can perform preventative and routine dental care, such as filling cavities, placing temporary crowns, or extracting teeth. They work under the supervision of dentists, while leaving the more complicated dental procedures for the dentists.
As of now, no bill has been filed for the 2026 session. But the 2025 language would have required dental therapists to follow several steps: 

Graduate from an accredited dental therapy school.
Complete a dental therapy practical or clinical exam produced by the American Board of Dental Examiners.
Complete at least 24 hours and up to 36 hours of continuing education biennially to maintain licensure.

Dental therapists would have to work under the supervision of a dentist but that could be under general supervision via a collaborative agreement without having the dentist on-site or without the dentist examining the patient first. 
During a CareQuest Institute for Oral Health webinar on dental therapy, panelists testified that dental therapists make about one-third to one-half of what dentists earn. CareQuest is a nonprofit “championing a more equitable future where every person can reach their full potential through excellent health.”
 Florida’s got an access problem
The latest available federal Health Resources and Services Administration data show an additional 10,143 dental practitioners are needed nationwide to address the dental health professional shortage. The agency supports programs like scholarships, loan repayment, and training to bolster skilled health workforces in underserved areas.
In Florida the problem is particularly acute. 
The state needs 1,259 additional dental providers to care for the nearly 6 million people lacking dental access. Dental health professional shortage areas means there’s a population-to-provider ratio of at least 5,000 to 1. 
American Dental Association data demonstrate Florida’s lack of dentists. While the overall dentist-to-100,000 population ratio in the U.S. was 59.5 in 2024, it was 52.4 in Florida. The ADA 2025 report shows that in Florida just 25.6% of the dentists participate in Medicaid, below all neighboring states.
An inside look at the numbers
The WellFlorida Health Planning Council — the private, nonprofit organization and state-designated local health council for 16 counties in North Central Florida — and Floridians for Dental Access have distributed data that show about 146,000 people went to the hospital or emergency department for dental care in 2024 and hospitals billed nearly $1 billion.
“These people are suffering and we as a society are paying for it. What I could have done with $1 billion and a dental therapist would have been unbelievable,” Catalanotto said.
More than 20% of the 2024 tab was billed to Medicaid, the taxpayer-supported health care safety net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled. “No pay” accounted for another 17% ($167.3 million) of the 2024 dental-related billings.
At nearly $1 billion, the 2024 costs represented a 77% increase in hospital billings since the group started tracking the data in 2021.
Between 2021 and 2024, dental costs went up for nearly all 32 rural counties across the state. Only Liberty and Glades counties saw decreases in their hospital-related dental costs during that time. 
Conversely, there was a 592% increase in hospital-related dental in Madison County even though the number of patients increased by about 23%.
Mum’s the word
The Florida Dental Association did not respond to Florida Phoenix’s requests for comment for this story.
The FDA has long opposed any effort to authorize dental therapists. In testimony before the Health Professions & Programs Subcommittee earlier this year, FDA chief legislative officer Joe Ann Hart insisted dental therapists wouldn’t improve public health. Authorizing dental therapists, she said, would allow someone “right out of high school with three years of dental therapy training to perform irreversible procedures such as extractions and administer local anesthesia.”
Catalanotto conceded the FDA, which he once belonged to, has a “wonderful lobbying system,” and a strong PAC.
“Everyone of these legislators has a dentist. And they can get their ear. And they can tell them stories,” Catalanotto laments.
The American Children’s Campaign is another proponent of dental therapy. Its president, Roy Miller, criticized the FDA for its pushback against dental therapy, saying in a prepared statement that it “ignores the soaring pain and suffering and doesn’t make any sense.”
“Dental therapists must pass the exact same licensing exam as dentists for the procedures they perform. They would be supervised by dentists. And it would be voluntary on whether a dentist would add them to their practice, as well. There are many dentists in Florida who support dental therapy, and the FDA certainly doesn’t speak for them.”

(Adam Thury/Mitchell Republic)One of South Dakota’s wealthiest businessmen says an aspect of economic development often gets overlooked — great public schools.
“If families know their children can get a top-quality education in Mitchell, that makes us more attractive than bigger, busier places,” said Roger Musick, who started and sold the telecommunications and software company, Innovative Systems.  
In mid-August, Musick devoted $33 million to education in his hometown of about 15,000 people. That includes a $15 million endowment for Mitchell Public Schools, another $15 million for Dakota Wesleyan University, and $3 million to get program expansions rolling immediately without waiting for the endowment to collect interest. 
Bank of America will invest the money. The endowment will earn about 7% annually. Five percent will support programs each year. Two percent will be reinvested to grow the account. 
A five-member board will oversee the programs. Members include Mitchell’s superintendent, the school board president, one board appointee, Dakota Wesleyan’s president and Musick.
Working parents
Musick has brought a lot of workers to Mitchell over his decades in business. He said it wasn’t the Corn Palace, the lake or the city’s events that convinced applicants to move. What they wanted was a quality education system for their kids and a safe place to leave them during the workday. 
So one of the projects expands Mitchell’s “Begindergarten” program. The class serves children old enough for kindergarten who are not quite ready socially or academically. 
The state funds only a half-day Begindergarten program, which limited access for working parents, Musick explained. The endowment expands Mitchell’s program to allow for full-day classes.










I want to live in a society where everybody is well educated, not just the people that can afford it. I have nothing against private education, but it will typically only be available to people who can afford it. Public education is what we have to have.


– Roger Musick


Musick said enrollment has already risen 80%, and the goal is to make it so that parents do not have to choose between waiting another year or sending their child unprepared.
After-school programs are also a priority. With the new funding, each public elementary school is hosting its own after-school program, staffed by certified teachers and aides, so parents no longer need to arrange rides to off-site locations.
“Some kids have great support at home to get their homework done. Some don’t,” Musick said. “This way, every child gets that help, and they also get experiences they might never have had otherwise.”
Students complete homework, receive tutoring, and participate in activities like sports and the arts.
“I hope this becomes a really good workforce recruitment tool,” Musick said.
Tressa Wede, director of education and community engagement at Dakota Wesleyan in Mitchell, said demand is high. She said at L.B. Williams Elementary, where she previously taught, about 140 students are already taking advantage of the after-school program. 
“The reception has been phenomenal,” she said.

At the university, the endowment will pay for teaching scholarships — encouraging more students to pursue careers as educators. Additionally, the fund will pay for Mitchell teachers to pursue their master’s degree. Musick said that’s all because teachers in South Dakota struggle with low salaries, discouraging people from pursuing the profession. The state ranks 46th nationally for teacher pay.
“Our teachers are far more valuable than that, and we need more emphasis there,” Musick said.
Wede said the initiative is making Mitchell’s teachers feel valued and she expects more aspiring educators to choose the community to call home. The master’s degree program requires scholarship recipients to teach in Mitchell for three years.
“This is probably the most exciting time I have experienced as a teacher,” she said. “We go into this because we want to make a positive difference, and here we are being supported in doing that.”
A belief in public education
The public school funding boost in Mitchell comes amid statewide ideological and political battles over education. 
Republican lawmakers in Pierre are weighing reallocating more public school funding toward alternatives such as homeschooling or vouchers. Some have leveled allegations that public school teachers are indoctrinating children and passed a bill to “protect students” from “divisive concepts.” They debated legislation during the last session requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted and taught in public school classrooms statewide. The bill narrowly failed in the House after passing the Senate.
Musick attended Mitchell’s schools and sent his children there. He said public education remains essential and deserves more focus and respect.
“I want to live in a society where everybody is well educated, not just the people that can afford it,” Musick said. “I have nothing against private education, but it will typically only be available to people who can afford it. Public education is what we have to have.”
Musick said he will track progress through the district’s report card and feedback from teachers. He hopes the project inspires other communities and state leaders to put more focus on public education.
“If you look at countries where people are happiest, like Norway and Denmark, education is really valued. Teachers are paid well and thought of highly,” Musick said. “That’s the kind of culture we need here.”
But even if Mitchell’s population never grows beyond 15,000, Musick said the gift will still have been worth it, because “we’ll have a lot of people who are smarter and more successful because of this focus on education.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-09-21 13:58:53+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,I don’t want to close any more mental health centers,Christopher Tuttle,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/i-dont-want-to-close-any-more-mental-health-centers/,The cost of operating our clinic with optimal staffing simply exceeded by a wide margin the amount we received from insurers – largely the state Medicaid program MassHealth – to operate it.,"LATE LAST YEAR, I made the hard decision to close a mental health center in Lynn, an area where more access to care is needed, not less. The cost of operating this clinic with optimal staffing simply exceeded by a wide margin the amount we received from insurers – largely the state Medicaid program MassHealth – to operate it.  
While my organization, Bridgewell, is both mission-driven and nonprofit, we can’t operate programs where the resources do not exist to support those programs. 
There is, however, a solution. Current legislation on Beacon Hill would permanently fix this funding gap, by boosting Medicaid rates for community mental health services and reviewing those rates every two years to ensure that the rates stay ahead of the cost of delivering the care. 
Mental health centers play an invaluable role at a time when behavioral health needs are surging, particularly among children who are still recovering from the effects of the pandemic while coping with pressures like cyber-bullying that did not exist when I was growing up.  
People seen at mental health centers have diagnoses including anxiety, PTSD, suicidal ideation and attempts, sexual and physical trauma, and significant substance use complexity. These centers provide individual and group therapy and are particularly adept at involving the entire family to devise solutions that can help patients recover.  
Mental health centers help create healthy communities. 
In addition to serving the needs of individuals, mental health centers also play an indispensable role in training clinicians. When mental health centers close, the Commonwealth loses training capacity for mental health practitioners. The irony is that many people complete their training at a mental health center and move on to private practice, where they can earn enough to repay their student loans. 
Across our organization, we currently have 15 open clinical positions. It takes between six and nine months to fill these positions. Our leadership team is being pulled away from their day-to-day job to fill the gaps created by these vacancies.  
We serve about 5,000 individuals at the three remaining clinics we now operate and often have wait times of up to four months for an initial consultation. Despite this strong demand, our outpatient clinics are losing millions of dollars.  
The rates paid by MassHealth – which covers some two million patients across Massachusetts – simply aren’t enough to fully cover the cost of clinician salaries, administrative operations, and other expenses that are all essential to providing these highly valuable services. Many private medical practitioners have stopped accepting any insurance payments and instead charge fees that low- and moderate-income individuals cannot afford. Our clinics are here to serve those who have no other place to go to get the care they need. 
After the Lynn closure, Bridgewell now operates three mental health centers — in Lowell, Amesbury, and Danvers. Our Lowell and Amesbury clinics provide a full range of services for both adults and children. Our Danvers clinic is one of only two in the Commonwealth that serves adults with both intellectual and developmental disabilities and a co-occurring mental health diagnosis. 
The Lynn clinic faithfully served the community for more than two decades. Its closure was not due to a lack of need, but unsustainable financial loss at the hands of low reimbursement rates from MassHealth.  
S.874 and H.1396 would require MassHealth, specifically, to implement a 5 percent rate increase for all outpatient behavioral health services. It would also ensure that rates paid to mental health centers are no less than 20 percent higher than comparable behavioral health services delivered in private practices. Current rates do not adjust for the cost of the additional staffing, training, and programmatic requirements placed on mental health centers. 
Rather than systematically close sites, stagnant MassHealth rates may force Bridgewell to exit outpatient mental health altogether. Such an idea would have been almost unthinkable only a few years ago. Our organization grew up out of the community mental health movement. I expect other organizations could be confronted with the same challenge. 
Mental health needs are soaring. Thankfully, Massachusetts has demonstrated true leadership with the launch of the Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform, which created a new “front door” for the state’s residents to access mental health and substance use services. 
But without a permanent fix to the reimbursement rate gap, we’ll continue losing ground in the quest to ensure access to vital mental health services for all. Let’s finish the job.

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Nursing has sanctioned several licensed nurses for clinical errors, patient-privacy violations, theft of patient medications, and other issues.
Among the cases is that of Diane Tegtmeyer, 58, who has been sanctioned by the board on at least four occasions.
Board records indicate Tegtmeyer was charged in May 2025 with failing to assess or evaluate the status of a patient, and with committing an act that may adversely affect a patient’s welfare.
The board alleged Tegtmeyer committed “medication errors” by documenting, on multiple occasions, that she had administered medication to residents of a care facility although video footage confirmed she did not enter those residents’ rooms.
The case was settled with Tegtmeyer agreeing to having her license placed in probation for 36 months during which time she will be subject to monitoring of her practice.
Tegtmeyer has faced disciplinary charges from the board on at least three prior occasions.
In 2005, Tegtmeyer, then known as Diane Teske, was accused of falsely charting that she had given residents of a care facility their medication while instead placing “the medication in the garbage.” The board ordered Tegtmeyer to complete 30 hours of training on ethics.
In 2007, the board alleged Tegtmeyer was fired by her employer for taking the credit card of an associate and using it to make purchases at Walmart. She later pleaded guilty to a charge of credit card forgery, according to board records. The board fined Tegtmeyer $50 and ordered her to complete an additional 30 hours of training in ethics.
In 2015, the Board of Nursing alleged Tegtmeyer failed to report a 2012 criminal conviction for tampering with records  and charged her with knowingly making misleading or untrue statement related to her credentials or licensure status. The board also alleged she falsified records related to the submission of a urine sample for lab testing. In resolving the case, the board fined Tegtmeyer $500 and ordered her to complete an additional 30 hours of training on ethics.
Other Iowa-licensed nurses sanctioned by the board include:
— Nancy Buttry, 53, who has agreed to surrender her nursing license. According to court records, Buttry was living in Harlan in 2023 and working for the Heritage House Senior Living facility in Atlantic. In April 2024, the board charged her with excessive use of drugs in a manner that might impair a licensee’s ability to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety.
In July 2024, the board dismissed the charges and Buttry was enrolled in the Iowa Professional Health Committee program that assists nurses with substance abuse issues.
Also in 2024, the board initiated a separate investigation into Buttry and, in January 2025, it charged Buttry with violating her contract with the committee. According to the board, Buttry had “not engaged in any of the Iowa Professional Health Committee’s requirements and was not in regular contact with the program” and had not participated in extended outpatient treatment.
Rather than contest the allegations, Buttry agreed to surrender her license.
— Lauren Haldin, who was charged by the board in April with misappropriating medications, property, supplies, or equipment of patients or a clinic; failing to properly safeguard or secure medications as required; and failing to assess and evaluate the status of a patient or client.
The offenses allegedly occurred while Haldin was working as a registered nurse at a Des Moines area behavioral health hospital in 2024. The board alleges the hospital fired Haldin after concluding she had stolen controlled substances. According to the board, surveillance video and medication records indicate that on multiple occasions, Haldin  pulled the drugs from the hospital’s supply and then failed to document the drugs as being administered to patients.
Haldin recently agreed to a settlement that calls for her license to be placed on probation for two years. The agreement also calls for her to complete a substance abuse evaluation, enroll in a chemical-screening program, and complete 16 hours of educational training on medication safety and nursing documentation.
— Cynthia Bustos, who was charged in April 2025 with failure to assess and evaluate the status of a patient or client, and with misappropriating medications, property, supplies, or equipment of patients or a clinic.
The board alleged the violations occurred while Bustos was practicing in Allison and that she had been suspended from employment “at a rehabilitation facility.” According to the board, that facility’s records indicate Bustos claimed, on seven occasions in September 2024, that she had administered hydrocodone to patients, although the “hydrocodone card and narcotics count sheet” could not be located.
To settle the case, Bustos agreed to have her license placed on probation for one year and to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
In 2022, the board charged Bustos with failing to assess and evaluate the status of a patient or client while employed in home care. According to the board, “multiple clients” had claimed that Bustos had not visited them and provided care on the dates she claimed to have been there. To resolve that case, Bustos agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training on medical documentation.
— Sherley Beaufils, who in recent years has been licensed to work as a nurse in Iowa and 45 other states. Beaufils recently agreed recently to surrender her license – an action that comes three and a half years after she was convicted of five counts of health care fraud, one count of conspiracy, five counts of aggravated identity theft and five counts of making false statements related to health care matters. As a result of the criminal convictions, the board alleges, Beaufils was sentenced to 87 months in prison and ordered to pay $1.6 million in restitution.
— Tonya Zimmerman, who was charged by the board with leaving a nursing assignment without ensuring the safety and welfare of her patients, and failing to assess and evaluate a patient.
The board alleged that while employed at Angels Care Home Health from October 2023 to April 2024, Zimmerman “fraudulently charted and abandoned her patients without a valid notice” to her employer. She was also accused of failing to see seven patients who were on her schedule, two of whom required wound care, and of documenting that she had visited patients at times when her computer tablet was known to be at her own residence.
Zimmerman was fired by Angels Care Home Health, according to the board. To resolve the board’s disciplinary charges, Zimmerman recently agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
— Debra Wolterman, who was charged by the board with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare, violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of patients, and engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
The board alleged that at some unspecified time in the past, the hospital where Wolterman worked fired her after it determined she had repeatedly accessed patients’ records for no work purpose and without the patients’ consent. The patients included several of Wolterman’s co-workers at the hospital.
To resolve the case, Wolterman agreed to receive a warning and to complete 30 hours of educational training on patient privacy.
— Pamela Rosendahl, who was charged by the board with failing to properly document an assessment or evaluation of a patient, and with engaging in unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public by participating in a sexual, emotional, social, or business relationship with a patient.
The board alleged that Rosendahl worked as an nurse at Advanced Correctional Health and was assigned to an unspecified county jail from about October 2023 to April 2024. The board alleged she crossed professional boundaries by developing an inappropriate relationship with an inmate to whom she passed out candy in violation of jail policy.
The board alleges that jail records also show two inmates called Rosendahl on her personal phone 11 times, and that she failed to document treatment she provided to one inmate on about 30 separate occasions.
To settle the case, the board agreed to issue Rosendahl a warning and to require that she complete 25 hours of educational training on documentation, ethics, and appropriate boundaries with patients.
— Patricia Jean Stanley, 64, of Des Moines, who recently agreed to surrender her license after being criminally charged with the financial exploitation of an older individual.
According to the board, Stanley pleaded guilty to the charge in February 2025, admitting that she took money from the retirement account of an older person who was not able to consent to the exchange. Stanley was sentenced to a prison term of no more than five years.
Court records indicate Stanley took more than $5,900 from the 88-year-old victim, identified in the records as a relative of Stanley’s. The court records show that previously, while working at Des Moines’ Broadlawns Medical Center in 2023, Stanley was charged with, and later convicted of, theft for her handling of the relative’s finances.

This story by  Tom McKone was first published by The Montpelier Bridge on Sept. 17.
Almost two dozen terra cotta and stoneware clay faces emerge from the surface, top to bottom, starting small and gradually increasing to full heads, creating the illusion they are coming into the room from the past. 
These are the faces of struggling people. Life’s hard for so many around the world today, as it was for all ancestors, I think, as I look at Burlington artist Susan Wilson’s “Becoming I,” at the opening of “Holding: Mementos Kept, Memories Kindled,” this year’s Art at the Kent exhibit at Kents Corner in Calais.
“As I work clay over, my simplified head forms — the faces of those who inspire me — emerge,” she writes. “I travel with those who are searching, yearning, asking questions, and struggling to move forward in their lives.”
Wilson’s works evoke the past, our shared and personal memories and our shared humanity — themes developed by the 22 Vermont artists in the Kent exhibit.
As visitors start their journey in the rambling, nearly two-century-old building, they walk through a hallway with 39 portraits.
“We wanted to show the breadth of humanity on this wall,” says Cornelia “Nel” Emlen, one of three curators. “We all have our own stories that we’re holding.”
Curator Allyson Evans calls the wall a “human container … emblematic of every person.”
Twelve of those works are exquisite portraits by Middlesex artist August Burns, who has two additional portraits in other parts of the exhibit. Burns, who painted the official portrait of Gov. Howard Dean, is one of two artists in this show who have painted official portraits of former Vermont governors. Middlebury artist Kate Gridley painted Gov. Jim Douglas’ portrait.
David Schutz, the third curator, says when they met with artists and developed the theme for this year’s exhibit, talking with Gridley convinced them to focus on memory. They gave her a room for 58 small paintings, in which she painted objects from her earliest memories, more or less chronologically, through her life.
In a brochure accompanying her installation, Gridley writes that years ago, when her very smart, aging father began experiencing dementia, he “amassed an enormous library of neurology books,” and the brain and memory became a regular part of their conversations.
“As daughter, I was losing him. As artist, I wanted to find a way to embody the explorations about memory that we had been sharing,” Gridley writes.
Burlington artist Jennifer Koch’s installation, “Specimens,” is distributed through the show and includes plenty of found objects. In an extraordinary series of shadow boxes, Koch starts with classic European paintings, then constructs an outrageous, three-dimensional headdress out of incongruous objects, from musical instruments and kitchen utensils to paint brushes, trophies and parts of toys. At first, the shadow boxes are just interesting, then they become addictive.
“Gratitude in a Time of Loss,” East Montpelier artist Daryl Burtnett’s installation about Covid-19, which was shown in the Vermont Supreme Court Gallery last fall, is the first art to ever be given a room on the museum’s third floor. The hundreds of small pieces, each acknowledging a Vermont life lost to the epidemic, are now in a different configuration from the previous show.
Juliana Jennings, co-owner of J. Langdon’s antique shop in Montpelier, has filled a space the size of a walk-in closet with hundreds of old items from her home — not from the store.
Self-trained Barre folk artist Gayleen Aiken (1934-2005) is featured in the self-contained Spotlight Gallery. With crayon, pen, pencil, and oil paints, Aiken created paintings, drawings, and cardboard cut-outs. Her works are in the permanent collections of several large museums, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.
The monthlong exhibit opened Sept. 12 and runs every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., through Oct. 12. In addition to Words Out Loud, there are several special events during the month, all described at kentscorner.org.
With beautiful weather, live music, and catered food, the opening celebration on Sept. 13 attracted several hundred visitors. The closing celebration will be held on Oct. 12, from 3 to 5 p.m.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Joe Major: The importance of civil discourse in Vermont and nationwide.","Dear Editor,
The recent fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk is a stark and tragic reminder of just how fragile our democracy and our civil society can be when disagreements cross the line into violence. 
Let me be clear: I fundamentally reject much of the rhetoric Kirk stood for. His words often carried racism, homophobia and misogyny that do real harm in communities across this country. But the test of our democracy is not whether we defend speech we agree with. The test is whether we defend the right to speak for those we most vehemently oppose.
As a public servant, I will always fight for that principle. The First Amendment must apply to everyone, or it means nothing at all.
Here in Vermont, I’m grateful that our politics remain rooted in civility, even when we disagree. Republicans and Democrats in our Statehouse debate with passion, and we certainly don’t see eye to eye on every issue — but the tone of those debates is grounded in mutual respect. At the end of the day, we share the same mission: to do what is best for Vermonters. That spirit of collaboration has allowed me to work across the aisle on meaningful legislation.
With Sen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, I’ve served on the Judicial Nominating Board to select fair and qualified candidates for our Supreme Court. With Sen. Randy Brock, R-Franklin, I helped pass a significant tax break for military retirees and survivors, exempting their benefits from state income tax. With Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, though we often hold views that are worlds apart, I’ve been proud to serve as vice chair to the Senate Agriculture Committee that he chairs. 
In my first year, he was a mentor, ensuring the committee stayed focused on helping Vermont’s farmers above all else.
This is the Vermont way: respectful discourse, shared responsibility and compromise where possible. But I recognize that this way of governing is not guaranteed. It is tenuous, and it must be protected. 
If we allow ourselves to stop listening to one another, if we refuse to find common ground, then the very freedoms we cherish — the right to speak, to disagree and to live in peace despite our differences — are at risk of slipping away. 
That is why I will continue to fight for both the right to speak freely and the responsibility to do so civilly. Our democracy depends on it.
Sen. Joe Major, D-WindsorHartford

By Ryan Colasant    This season was bound to bring many firsts for the University of Delaware as they transitioned into FBS football. This game against Florida International University ensured more first time occurrences as the Fightin’ Blue Hens took on their first conference foe in the two programs first ever meeting.
In a season filled with first time milestones, UD introduced itself to Conference USA in a big way defeating the FIU Panthers on the road, 38-16, Saturday evening.
The Blue Hens started the game with a field goal on their opening possession. The Panthers retaliated with a promising drive that landed them at UD’s ten yard line. Panther quarterback Keyone Jenkins dropped back on third down and looked right searching for a receiver to come open in the endzone. Jenkins thought he found an open target and fired a pass that landed in the blue gloves of Delaware safety Mysonne Pollard.
Pollard’s interception stalled FIU’s momentum, but didn’t result in points for the Blue Hen offense. UD was forced to punt the ball away on its ensuing offensive possession. The Panthers started the next drive on their own 46-yard line and three plays later held a 7-3 advantage over the newcomers.
The scoring stalled there. The UD defense didn’t allow a single point the rest of the half and allowed the Blue Hen offense to take control of the game in the second quarter outscoring the Panthers, 21-0.
Their first score of the frame followed Pollard’s second interception of the half, turning the ball over to the offense at their own 45-yard line. Running back Jo Silver capitalized on Pollard’s first-ever two-interception game with a 14-yard touchdown run, returning the lead to UD.
On the next drive, Blue Hen quarterback Nick Minicucci connected with graduate receiver Nick Laboy in the back right of the endzone for a two yard score increasing their lead to ten.
UD’s defense forced a three and out on FIU’s next possession and the Panthers punted the ball to Kyre Duplessis. Duplessis caught the punt and shed a couple of arm tackles blazing through the middle of field before settling down the left sideline. The Coastal Carolina transfer followed his career day against UConn with another career milestone completing a 68-yard punt return with a trip to the endzone.
FIU tried to score before halftime but a key sack from graduate student Dillon Trainer on third down forced the Panthers to try a field goal as the clock dwindled down. The Panthers got the kick off just in time, but it fell wide right.
The Blue Hens held all the momentum from there and never let up, scoring two more touchdowns in the second half courtesy of a couple Minicucci touchdown throws to Laboy and Viron Ellison Jr.
The Blue Hen offense finished the game with over 350 yards of total offense and just one turnover. Manicucci threw for 218 yards and three touchdowns to go along with one interception. Laboy finished with just two catches, but both were touchdown grabs setting a new career high for touchdown catches in a game.
UD played a clean game compared to FIU only committing two penalties against FIU’s seven. The defense compiled five tackles for loss, two turnovers and held CUSA’s fourth highest scoring offense to just 16 points.
The Blue Hens sit atop the conference standings after the win and hold claim to the conference’s second best scoring offense.
The Blue Hens next game will be on October 3 against the conference’s top scoring offense of Western Kentucky University.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/b386fe75-7647-4917-970b-cc0a63ae9a0e.png,,,2025-09-21 08:56:52.237663

Many northerners were outraged that the law compelled them, under threat of a prison sentence or stiff fine, to work in support of slavery.

History is littered with unintended consequences. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 is a prime example. Envisioned by Congress as a way to ease tensions between the North and South over the brutally painful issue of slavery, the law served only to inflame regional resentments.
Many northerners were outraged that the law compelled them, under threat of a prison sentence or stiff fine, to work in support of slavery. Specifically, the law required state and local officials to assist the federal marshals who were tasked with capturing and returning people who had escaped slavery. Ordinary citizens could also be charged with a crime if they appeared to “knowingly and willingly obstruct, hinder, or prevent” the seizure of formerly enslaved people.
Just how badly Congress miscalculated when it passed the law became clear in Vermont, where the state government instituted its own new statute that made the federal law virtually impossible to enforce. In doing so, Vermont lawmakers argued that abiding by the Fugitive Slave Law would violate both the state and federal constitutions. 
The Fugitive Slave Law was part of a series of measures that together became known as the Compromise of 1850. The laws were an attempt to balance the interests of the free and slave states in resolving issues arising from the Mexican-American War. Victory had brought vast new territories under American control, so Congress needed to decide whether any new states being created would allow slavery.
Hammered out by Whig Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky and Vermont-born Democratic Sen. Stephen Douglas, who represented Illinois, the compromise admitted California as a free state and banned slavery in Washington, D.C. In return, Congress declared that settlers in Utah and New Mexico could decide whether those territories would permit slavery. In late September, Congress also passed the Fugitive Slave Law, which constituted a major strengthening of existing laws.
The Burlington Free Press responded to the Fugitive Slave Law with an extraordinary editorial. Ostensibly writing to formerly enslaved people who were seeking freedom, the newspaper declared: “We think a good deal more of the Slave who has the spirit to attempt to assert his ‘inalienable right’ to personal liberty, than we do of the white man who would deprive him of that right.”
“KEEP OUT OF THE CITIES,” the Free Press advised. “Morality and Humanity are dead among City officials. Where men congregate together in great herds, the vicious and inhuman altogether predominate over the just and humane.” Cities breed greed, the editorial argued, and their populations “care very little about freedom.”
Instead, the Free Press suggested Vermont as a destination: “Go into the uncontaminated COUNTRY. Seek our quiet Villages, where the Mountains and the Valleys and the Streams and the Air, are the Evangelists of Freedom. Go into an atmosphere that Slave-Catchers cannot breathe and live — where Habeas Corpus and Trial by Jury are substantial realities, and will not be surrendered till the Constitution authoritatively demands the sacrifice. Don’t stop among the many, but among the few. Come to Vermont….”
The Free Press editor was building on Vermont’s reputation as an opponent of slavery. In 1777, the state had become the first state to ban slavery in its Constitution. That prohibition, however, came with a significant asterisk — it did not apply to males under the age of 21 or females under 18. Also, there was no enforcement mechanism, so incidents of people being enslaved in Vermont continued into at least the first decade of the 1800s. In 1835, mobs in Rutland and Montpelier disrupted antislavery speeches by a touring minister. Vermont’s record was hardly unblemished.
But much had changed in Vermont during the decade and a half leading up to 1850. Antislavery speakers and writers had persuaded some Vermonters to change their views. More importantly, the war with Mexico offered tangible proof that, left unchecked, slavery would likely spread. The massive territories that came with the American victory threatened to bring perhaps five new slave states into the Union. Some Vermonters tolerated slavery where it had already taken root, but they were deeply uncomfortable with allowing it to grow.
In the weeks after the Fugitive Slave Law’s passage, Vermonters gathered at meetings around the state to denounce it. The Brandon Post listed six meetings in Rutland County alone (Brandon, Rutland, Wallingford, Castleton, Poultney and Benson).
The Friends of Liberty of Chittenden and Addison counties advertised an “Indignation Meeting” to be held in North Ferrisburgh to protest the law, which had made Vermont a “Slave Hunting ground and our citizens Human Blood Hounds.”
The Burlington Courier published an article headlined “How To Oppose the Fugitive Slave Law,” which argued against violence, rebellion and mob rule, “(a)nd yet we mean resolutely to oppose the (law), and to use all our influence to prevent its execution.”  
While arguing for the law’s repeal, the St. Albans Messenger tried to calm people’s passions. “We hope that Vermont will express none of this fanatical law-breaking disposition which is too manifest in many places out of the state,” it wrote. “Ultraism and fanaticism of every kind is now glutting itself on the excitement in reference to this bill.” The newspaper urged Vermonters not to “imitate this worst feature of southern manners, and resort to nullification and anarchy.”  
Vermont Gov. Charles Kilborn Williams, an ardent abolitionist who once declared that any law supporting slavery was “unchristian” and “violates the right of nature,” helped push a bill through the state Legislature that made the Fugitive Slave Law effectively unenforceable in Vermont. 
The statute became known as the Habeas Corpus Law, after the legal procedure under which courts review whether a person is being detained or imprisoned legally. Under the new law, Vermont state’s attorneys of each county had to bring any alleged fugitive before a judge. If the judge failed to release the accused, the defendant had the right to a trial by jury, with the state covering the costs. Given public sympathies, Vermont juries would have inevitably ruled against the enslavers.
The law put Vermont at the forefront of the fight. No other state passed a new personal liberty law between 1850 and 1853, though some Northern states followed suit after that time.  
Vermont’s law faced harsh criticism. Editors of the Daily National Intelligencer, a newspaper in Washington, D.C., that advocated gradual emancipation, wrote: “We are mortified and astonished that such an enactment should not only have received the concurrence of the Legislature, but the sanction of the Governor.”
President Millard Fillmore was outraged with Williams and the Vermont Legislature. “(T)he president and the entire Cabinet are very much exasperated at the course of proceedings in the Vermont legislature,” reported the Memphis Daily Eagle, “and … they determined to enforce the fugitive slave law in Vermont, should a case arise there, if it required the whole military force of the United States to do it.”  
Opponents of the Vermont law criticized the state for engaging in “nullification,” the claim that individual states have the right to ignore federal laws they believe are unconstitutional. Two decades earlier, South Carolina lawmakers had famously attempted to nullify federal tariffs they said promoted Northern interests over Southern ones.
Supporters of the Vermont law, however, argued that the state statute was more constitutional than the federal one because habeas corpus and its guarantee of due process are enshrined in both the U.S. and Vermont constitutions.
The Natchez Democrat newspaper in Mississippi saw things differently. “This law is clearly and palpably unconstitutional, and ought to be and will be kicked out of every court in Vermont, unless the person sitting upon the bench is either a knave or a fool,” the paper opined. The newspaper said the law had been “smuggled through” the Vermont Legislature late in the session, when many lawmakers were absent “and the rest (charity would suppose) were drunk.”

In Memphis, Tennessee, the Daily Eagle saw Vermont’s effective blocking of federal law as dangerous. “A government that is not able to enforce its own laws is in reality no government at all. It is a shallow humbug, a misty form, a legal mockery; and should be done away with as speedily as possible,” the paper argued.
The editor of the Georgia Journal and Messenger informed readers that “the acts of the Vermont Legislature will be everywhere regarded in the South as a dangerous aggression.” Still, despite what the writer termed Vermont’s “treasonable propensities,” he wasn’t concerned. “Happily the State is so utterly insignificant in numbers, wealth, and influence that her efforts to sever the bonds which hold us together need excite no other feeling than that of contempt.”
The Argus of Albany, New York, however, saw Vermont’s action as a dangerous escalation of tensions. “Vermont has begun the work — South Carolina may follow,” the paper wrote. “What state will next step into the arena, and nullify another part of the constitution? If this work is to go on, where will the end be? What will become of the constitution or law, or of the Union itself?”
Indeed, a decade later, South Carolina took the ultimate step of nullification when it became the first state to secede from the Union.

It’s a reminder that while Michigan has made real progress against opioid overdoses, the crisis is far from over. We have to keep going.
As an anesthesiologist, a physician specializing in anesthesia, I work with some of the most powerful pain-relieving medications available. In the operating room, drugs like fentanyl, morphine, and hydromorphone are invaluable. At the right doses, these opioids relieve pain and ease anxiety. I have seen how these drugs can also slow breathing, drop blood pressure, or stop a heart.
That’s why anesthesiologists train for years to balance benefit and risk, adjusting every dose to the age, health and history of the patient we care for, even any previous opioid use. We also use nerve blocks and non-opioid medicines to minimize the amount of opioid given. In healthcare, opioid delivery is anything but “one size fits all.”
Outside healthcare settings, the picture is different. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl is has become widespread — cheap to produce, far stronger than heroin and often hidden in counterfeit pills or powders. I’ve spoken with families who lost loved ones after unknowingly taking one of these pills. With fentanyl, overdoses can happen so quickly that emergency help may not arrive in time.
That’s why naloxone, the medication that can reverse an overdose, is so critical. Michigan has taken major steps to expand access through pharmacies, community nonprofits and even vending machines. Insurance companies often cover it, and hospitals send kits home with patients who may be at risk of overdose. Naloxone is a proven, non-addictive rescue medication that reverses overdoses and saves lives.
Our work isn’t done. We need to make sure every community, every school, and every family that wants naloxone can get it easily.
Through the Overdose Prevention Engagement Network, my colleagues and I are working to make opioid prescribing safer, educate communities and help Michigan continue leading the way in reducing overdoses. We’re proud of the partnerships we’ve built with the state to distribute naloxone widely. Sustaining and expanding these efforts will take ongoing support from policymakers, health professionals, families, schools and faith groups alike.
On this National Opioid Awareness Day, I hope people will remember two truths: opioids can be a vital tool when given by trained specialists, like anesthesiologists, and they can be deadly when obtained illicitly or used without medical supervision. If you or someone you love is at risk, make sure naloxone is nearby. And if you’re experiencing challenges with opioids or are concerned about opioid use disorder, you can find help by visiting Michigan’s Substance Use Disorder Services & Programs Dashboard.
Michigan has shown national leadership in overdose prevention, yet our work continues. Now we must keep acting to sustain that leadership — to protect our neighbors, preserve live, and build a future where pain is relieved safely and overdoses are no longer a leading cause of death.

Will he do something similar in 2025?,"There is a chance that a rare case — not a pandemic but a single occurrence of bipartisanship on a health care issue — could break out in the U.S. Congress before the end of the year.
Such cases are few and far between, but national press reports indicate that the Republican-controlled Congress, fearing the backlash in the 2026 midterm elections, is pondering extending the program that provides enhanced federal financial assistance to people purchasing health insurance policies through the Affordable Care Act exchanges.
If the enhanced subsidies expire at the end of 2025 as scheduled, it would create a substantial increase in cost for the millions of Americans who get their health insurance coverage through the marketplace exchange — a key component of former President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
During the administration of former President Joe Biden, Democrats increased the federal subsidies provided to help people pay for the ACA exchange policies. No Republican voted for the enhanced federal subsidies just as they did not vote for the ACA in 2010.
But now fearing a backlash in the 2026 midterm elections, some are reportedly trying to find a way to extend the enhanced subsidies for at least another year. 
If the federal financial assistance for the cost of the marketplace policies expires, Mississippi will be hit particularly hard.
Unless Congress acts before the end of the year, the price of the marketplace’s health insurance policies will increase an estimated $480 annually in Mississippi, according to KFF, a national group that conducts health care research. The subsidies are provided based on income levels, so the costs for some could be much higher next year if the enhanced assistance expires at the end of 2025.
Participation in the marketplace by Mississippians has increased 242% in recent years since the enhanced federal assistance program was enacted, according to KFF. Only Texas has seen a greater increase at 255%.
Many of the Republicans who expect tough elections in 2026 now want to extend the program.
Republican Roger Wicker of Tupelo, Mississippi’s senior U.S. senator, is not up for reelection in 2026, but he has at times worked with Democrats on bipartisan health bills.
In 1997, Wicker, then a new member of the U.S. House, was part of a bipartisan alliance that passed the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which helped children of the working poor obtain health insurance.
The program has been pivotal in Mississippi, a state with one of the nation’s highest poverty rates and a large segment of its population working in low paying jobs. About 85,000 Mississippi children are enrolled in CHIP, according to Medicaid.gov.
The creation of CHIP occurred against big political odds. Before it was proposed, then-President Bill Clinton tried to pass his version of universal health care with First Lady Hillary Clinton leading that effort. The bill, which was derisively called Hillarycare, was savaged. The bill crashed and burned and created considerable ill will in Washington.
But in the wake of that failure, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Sens. Ted Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, passed CHIP. Hillary Clinton, history should note, is also credited with playing a role in the passage of CHIP.
Wicker was part of that bipartisan effort. Wicker, who had been a member of the state Senate only three years earlier where he chaired the Public Health Committee, viewed CHIP as a proposal that would help Mississippi families.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, who at the time was the Senate majority leader, opposed CHIP, calling it “a big government program.” Thad Cochran, the state’s senior U.S. senator, like Wicker, supported the program.
And Cochran, a key member of the Senate Appropriations Committee for years, played pivotal roles in ensuring CHIP continued in future years when it appeared it might be in jeopardy.
In 2025, it will be interesting to see if Wicker or any other member of Mississippi’s congressional delegation is instrumental in ensuring the enhanced subsidies continue for the ACA exchange.
After all, all four U.S. House members and Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state’s junior U.S. senator, will be up for reelection in 2026.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190605/Roger-Wicker-7.jpg,,,2025-09-21 07:57:26.832948

A vital doctrine of animism is the attribution of conscious life to phenomena of nature. Even if our own beliefs about the soul and its corporeal habitats do not extend quite so far, though, the human mind still likes to anthropomorphize — to assign emotions and personality traits to flora and fauna as a means of extolling their value. Perhaps no one understands this better than a poet. This week, Isla Segal of Woodstock relays observations of the omnipresent, nonverbal exchanges that enliven every forest.

Trees talk
Isla Segal, 14, Woodstock
The trees talk,
you know?
They talk and if you listened,
you would know
they whisper
like kindergarteners
who can’t stand straight in line
but can jump straight
into mudpuddles.
They can’t stay quiet,
like my siblings late at night,
and the wind whistles sometimes,
and the trees call back,
you know?
And then the leaves twirl
down to the dirt,
but the branches still murmur
late into the winter,
with too much snow to talk very loud – 
but they’re still talking.
I know.

“Vermont will bear the burdens of this facility but might not directly reap the environmental benefits that it provides,” wrote a commissioner in a concurring opinion.

The Public Utility Commission gave the green light Monday to an 80-acre industrial solar field development on a sloping hillside of sprawling meadows, thick forests and agricultural fields in Shaftsbury.
Neighbors of the project and environmental advocates in southern Vermont have vehemently opposed the project first proposed in 2023 due to the potential environmental and aesthetic harm to the land. Multiple organizers said they are likely to appeal the commission’s decision to award VT Real Estate Holdings 1 LLC — also known as Shaftsbury Solar — a certificate of public good.
Alongside consideration of local impact, the commission’s decision in favor of the Connecticut developer, Freepoint Solar, owned by Freepoint Commodities, was “heavily informed by Vermont’s ambitious energy policy goals” outlined in the state’s public service statute, according to the final decision, signed by Chair Edward McNamara and Commissioner Riley Allen.
“We have also considered Vermont’s role within the broader, interconnected New England grid and our reliance on that network to maintain a reliable electric grid and to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction mandates,” McNamara and Allen wrote. 
The decision comes after Vermont reportedly failed to meet its carbon reduction targets this year, and a judge dismissed a lawsuit attempting to hold the state accountable for this failure. 
Commissioner Margaret Cheney wrote a concurring opinion to the decision, agreeing that the project “checks all the necessary boxes” of Vermont statute, but voiced concern with the location and the tree clearing required to make way for the large-scale solar project.
While the project itself will occupy 80 acres when complete, Cheney wrote that 104 acres would be disrupted during construction, including 64 acres of agricultural land. Forty-two acres of trees will be axed, including 34.6 acres of mature trees, Cheney added.
Forests sequester carbon, so tree clearing partially counteracts the greenhouse gas benefits associated with the addition to the renewable energy grid, Cheney wrote. The power and renewable energy credits created through the project can also be sold outside the state, so “Vermont will bear the burdens of this facility but might not directly reap the
environmental benefits that it provides,” she wrote.
If renewable energy development prompts deforestation and a lack of substantive benefits to Vermont utilities and customers, the commission may reconsider how they arrive at “public good” determinations for future projects, Cheney asserted.
“We should consider how to create incentives to site very large facilities away from unspoiled land and close to existing infrastructure,” Cheney wrote. “Although this goal may be best achieved through future legislative amendments, renewable energy developers should be more deliberate in identifying sites that minimize localized aesthetic and environmental impacts.”
Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, said the Shaftsbury project is the “solar equivalent” of the controversial, industrial-scale Lowell Wind Project over a decade prior.
While in favor of solar canopies in developed areas, Smith expressed concern about the industrial project on agricultural land increasing stormwater runoff, degrading prime soils and harming biodiversity of the area. She said the fuel energy and clear cutting of mature trees necessary for the project counteracts any positive environmental impacts. 
“This is going to do nothing to reduce carbon emissions,” Smith said. “There is no need to destroy an ecosystem in order to create solar electricity for the region.” 
Meanwhile, the town government and regional planning commission have taken a different stance on the project. 
Shaftsbury Select Board Chair Zoe Contros Kearl wrote in a Friday statement that the proposed construction has been “painfully contentious,” but that the board hopes residents will focus on the solar project’s positive impacts for the town now that it has been approved. 
“The Town will benefit from this project in numerous ways — including increased funding for our elementary school, substantial property tax contributions that will make a real difference in our annual municipal budget, and the funding of a new brush truck for our Fire Department,” Kearl wrote. 
Bennington Regional Planning Commission Planner Callie Fishburn wrote in a Thursday statement that the Shaftsbury solar project’s approval will further the region’s renewable energy goals. The commission is requiring the solar developer to manage the concerning impacts of the projects, Fishburn wrote, “including in the areas of aesthetics, preservation of agricultural soils and damage to infrastructure,” Fishburn wrote.
Steve Collier, general counsel for the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, said that “solar projects raise substantial — and sometimes competing — interests,” but a certificate of public good requires long-term protection of agricultural soils, which the developer agreed to and should be followed. 
“Renewable energy is important and beneficial. Preserving agricultural land and our ability to grow food is critical,” Collier wrote. “We are concerned about the ongoing loss of farmland and believe Vermont needs to thoughtfully use and maintain it.”
Jim Porter, director for public advocacy for the Department of Public Service, wrote in a statement Friday that the department found no engineering problems or aesthetic concerns with the project, as the developer plans to implement mitigation measures recommended by the department and neighbors to the project. 
The solar development aligns with the present and future energy service needs and conforms with the Vermont Comprehensive Energy Plan based on expert testimony provided by the Department, Porter wrote.
Judith Schwartz, a Bennington resident and environmental journalist who wrote a commentary on the Shaftsbury Solar Project, opposes the idea that deforestation is necessary for renewable energy development.
As a result of the Shaftsbury solar project development, a piece of southern Vermont’s wildlife corridor between the Taconics and Green Mountains will be lost, and threatened beech and white ash trees will be axed in the process of constructing solar fields, Schwartz said.
Tony Eprile, Bennington resident and Schwartz’s partner, said the pair are not against solar but think renewable energy should be planned in already developed areas in order to mitigate environmental impacts. He also expressed concern that the solar energy created will add to the grid rather than replace fossil fuels, feeding a “bottomless demand for energy” created by data centers and Artificial Intelligence technology. 
“Green energy is a very pretty term for somewhat less damaging energy sources,” Eprile said. “There’s no way that you can produce solar panels without doing some environmental damage.”
Kit Ausschnitt, a neighbor and intervenor to the project, noted that the company lawyers wrote in July that the economic viability of the project hinged on the Public Utility Commission making a swift decision, citing changing tariff policies and $20 million of federal solar subsidies that the developers could lose.
In a letter to the Public Utility Commission, Ausschnitt expressed concern that the developers may abandon the project after it’s begun if it’s rendered financially unviable, meaning the natural environment would be already tampered with and “no economic benefit can flow to the community, the State and the people of Vermont.”
Ausschnitt said he is in favor of ambitious renewable energy goals, but the push created by the Legislature to develop renewable energy at the expansive forests and agricultural land is “counterproductive.” 
“It’s just a beautiful natural area.” Ausschnitt said. “They’re going to destroy lots of habitat and create all kinds of environmental damage and flood risk in an area that is already prone.”
Freepoint Solar’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

(Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)Louisiana has shifted one of its two large pharmacy benefits contracts for state employees away from CVS Health, but Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers kept the most lucrative agreement with that pharmacy giant in place. 

The state Office of Group Benefits will now use two pharmacy benefit managers for its health insurance plans that cover state government employees, public school teachers, local government workers, retirees and their families. Previously, it had only used the CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health. 

Louisiana lawmakers signed a new arrangement Thursday with Southern Scripts, owned by Louisiana-based Liviniti LLC, that pays the company $390.6 million to handle commercial insurance plans for the Office of Group Benefits. They also approved a contract with SilverScript, another CVS Health affiliate, for $748.8 million to manage Medicare Part D prescription plans, which many retired state workers use.

The contracts were enacted on emergency bases for 2026 with the possibility of extensions for 2027. 
For years, lawmakers have been upset with CVS Caremark, the state’s current pharmacy benefit manager. The company’s contract with the Office of Group Benefits made it difficult for independent pharmacies to serve the 212,000 public employees, teachers and others with state health coverage. 
Governments and private employers hire pharmacy benefit managers, also called PBMs, to oversee prescription medication benefits for their health insurance plans. But independent pharmacists say PBMS are driving them out of business by undercutting their reimbursement rates and favoring chain pharmacies the PBM parent companies own. 
For example, CVS Health owns Caremark, SilverScript and well over 100 pharmacy locations throughout Louisiana. 
The state’s new arrangement with Liviniti should allow more independent pharmacists to start serving those enrolled in commercial state health insurance plans. The Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association endorsed the contract a few days before lawmakers approved it. 
The state’s experience with seeking out a new pharmacy benefits manager over the past few months indicates how difficult it has been to move away from CVS Health however.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The state approached six companies about taking over its business, said Heath Williams, CEO of the Office of Group Benefits. Three were not interested and none could provide a contract proposal for Medicare Part D enrollees that was financially competitive with CVS. Only Livinti offered a deal that could go up against CVS for commercial insurance plans. 

By switching to Livinti and SilverScript, enrollees in commercial plans should have more options for pharmacies they can use, but the Office of Group Benefits will end up spending a few million dollars more than it would have if it had stayed only with CVS Caremark. 
“You are not going to save money from moving from one to PBM to another,” Williams told lawmakers Thursday. 
Louisiana faced more challenges finding a company not owned by CVS to cover its Part D enrollees because federal regulations place restrictions on how the state can negotiate that contract, he said. 
The state does expect more transparency about drug pricing as a result of the new PBM contracts. Williams said it should be easier for the state to determine what is driving up drug prices and whether rebates, which can financially benefit  PBMs, are to blame.   
“You want full transparency on rebates,” he said. 
The new PBM contracts come a few months after a dramatic showdown between the governor and the Louisiana Senate. 
During the last few days of a two-month legislative session in June, Landry pushed lawmakers to pass a law banning Louisiana pharmacy benefit managers from also owning in-state pharmacies as CVS does. The Senate refused to go along with Landry’s demands and killed the proposal, saying such a drastic move required more study before lawmakers voted on it. 

At the time, CVS claimed such a ban would force it shut down its brick-and-mortar locations in Louisiana. They exerted pressure on legislators by sending emails and texts to thousands of Louisiana residents, implying they could potentially lose access to their medications at CVS if the bill passed. 

The mass text and email campaign prompted Attorney General Liz Murrill to file three lawsuits against CVS on behalf of the state, including one regarding the text messages.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cvs.jpg,,,2025-09-21 06:56:26.059992

This story by Jason Starr was first published by the Williston Observer on Sept. 11.
Imagine, Williston’s own little black box theater. Michael Fidler and Connor Kendall did, and they have found just the spot.
At the start of the Vermont Repertory Theatre’s third season, the nonprofit theater group has found a home, tucked away in a corner suite of a building on Commerce Street. It’s a dead-end road with an eclectic mix of businesses, including an ice cream manufacturing facility and scoop shop, a veterinarian office, and a chimney parts manufacturer.
The theater suite has a performing arts legacy. It was once home to an Irish dance school.
“We had just started looking for a space and this place came up, and we said, ‘Oh wow, it’s perfect,” said Chloe Fidler, the group’s treasurer, administrator and a performer.
The Vermont Repertory Theatre started in summer 2023 with a presentation of Shakespeare’s “A Comedy of Errors” at the Isham Barn in Williston. It has returned to the barn each summer since — “Spamelot” in 2024 and “The Miser” in 2025. 
Next summer, it plans a two-weekend presentation of “Shakespeare in Love.” The barn has been a reliable summer venue for the group, and in the winter, it has performed at Main Street Landing in Burlington. Rehearsals have taken place at Williston Federated Church.
But the Commerce Street location can be an all-encompassing headquarters: a rehearsal space, performance theater, prop storage and board meeting room.
“To be able to rehearse in a space where you can have your props and your set, and they just stay there, you don’t have to bring things into every rehearsal and take them out again — it’s a total gamechanger for us,” said Chloe Fidler, who is married to Michael Fidler.
The performance space can seat 75, but it’s still in its infancy. It will make its debut in October with the presentation of “The Williston One Acts,” three one-act plays over four nights running Oct. 15-18. The group’s Main Street Landing show this winter is set to be “Uncle Vanya” from Feb. 28 to March 6.
Chloe Fidler described the company’s niche as the presentation of classic texts with high production values: “community theater, but with really high expectations,” she said.
“It’s kind of cool that it is sort of tucked away,” she said of the new space. “It’s like our little Williston secret … We’re excited to see how it all pans out.”
Auditions for the Vermont Repertory Theatre’s third season of shows will be by appointment Sept. 25-27. For more information, visit www.vermontrep.com or email admin@vermontrep.com. For show tickets visit https://theaterengine.com/productions/3018.

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderMILTON – The national Democratic Party’s top official campaigned in Georgia this weekend with Democrat Debra Shigley in hopes of helping her flip a conservative state Senate district in the north Atlanta suburbs.
Ken Martin, who chairs the Democratic National Committee, called Shigley’s surprising first-place finish in last month’s seven-way race “a huge overperformance for Democrats in a district that has historically been pretty red.”
Shigley, a Milton mom, attorney and small business owner, won about 40% of the vote in the first round of voting. She now faces a head-to-head matchup with Republican Jason Dickerson, a Cherokee County resident who is the president of a private investment firm. The district includes north Fulton and Cherokee counties.
Martin, who became the new DNC chair in February, said his visit to Georgia represents an effort to rebuild after Democrats suffered devasting losses last year and to broaden the party’s focus beyond federal power. That includes supporting candidates running for mayor, school board and other local races too, he said.
“We’ve made the mistake as a national party for too long of just focusing on what happens in Washington DC,” he told reporters Saturday.
He said Democrats are overperforming in special elections since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Some are even winning, such as a Democrat who flipped a state Senate seat representing a farming community in Pennsylvania.
“We’re happy that we’re overperforming, but there’s no brownie points when you come in second place, and you can’t get anything done when you’re in the minority,” Martin said. “But guess what? Every inch of ground that we win adds up. Every race that we flip adds up. That’s how we start rebuilding our party again, and Debra is an important part of that rebuilding process.”
Tuesday’s special election is being held to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of former state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican and staunch ally of President Donald Trump. Beach, who coasted to reelection last year with 70% of the vote, is now U.S. Treasurer.
Shigley acknowledged the challenge of winning the right-leaning district Saturday as she stood outside her Milton home, where Martin, state Senate leaders Harold Jones and Elena Parent and volunteers gathered before fanning out to knock on the doors of voters.
“We surprised the Republicans (last month), and I’m here to say that we are going to surprise them again. It is going to be an uphill battle until the finish line,” she said.
Shigley said her team had visited about 35,000 houses. Her door-knocking outings have featured a long list of prominent Democrats, with former House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams and ex-GOP Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who is now running for governor as a Democrat, set to join in for the final push.
On the Republican side, Dickerson has touted a long list of endorsements from high-profile Georgia Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp.
“We are continuing to focus on the citizens of District 21 with Meet & Greets and knocking on doors,” Dickerson said in a comment Saturday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-21 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"For this New Britain man, late summer is pigeon racing season",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/21/ct-homing-pigeon-racing-season/,"Wilberto Aponte, president of the Connecticut Classic Pigeon Club, has 200 homing pigeons. With racing season underway, the stakes are high.","An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
Hundreds of pigeons emerge from a slim opening in a backyard shed outfitted into a coop, their heads bobbing as their owner, Wilberto Aponte out, shoos them out, gruffly urging them to fly.
In a furious flurry, more than 200 homing pigeons take off, Aponte’s words muffled by the flapping of gray wings. They take to the sky, looping in wide circles above their home roost. Over the next half hour, those loops shrink as the flock makes its way back to land, and Aponte and his friend Victor Pagan call the pigeons home.
“Get in, get in, get in,” they cry in a sing-song falsetto.
The flight is just part of Aponte’s training for the racing season. Aponte, who is retired, is the president of the Connecticut Classic Pigeon Club, which has about 60 members, mostly in the New Britain, Hartford and New Haven areas. It’s one of a few pigeon racing clubs across the state. 
The season began late last month with a race in upstate New York. The participating pigeons were trucked to the start, then released. From there, they flew nearly 100 miles to their homes.
Club members use trackers and a formula to determine how far and how fast each pigeon flew and to assign the birds their points. The owner with the most points wins. There are 10 races each season for the club. The number of birds allowed in each race varies depending on the number of owners participating and the size of the truck to haul birds. The season lasts from August to October.
“You can also lose your wife and your kids because with the pigeons, once you get addicted, just like any other hobby, it takes your time,” Aponte said. “The new guys get excited. They start with, say, 10 pigeons, and once they win a race, that’s it. The next year, they got 100 pigeons. Something kicks in.”

When U.S. Army paratroopers, dropped behind enemy lines and cannot use radio communication for fear of revealing their positions, they use trained pigeons that were also dropped by parachute in special containers or pigeons strapped to their chests.  The pigeon, encased in a special jacket, is attached to the paratrooper’s jacket on Sept. 11, 1943.
For centuries, pigeons and humans have been closely intertwined. The birds make homes in the nooks and crannies of buildings, eat grains and trash and are sometimes fed by human tourists or “pigeon mothers,” who make a habit of feeding them, often in city parks.
Pigeons were first domesticated thousands of years ago by the Mesopotamians and Egyptians. People have used them as food, to carry messages and to learn the inner workings of genetics. They were used as messengers in both world wars and, in an experimental World War II project, to detonate missiles with their beaks. Charles Darwin studied them to write his “On the Origin of Species,” and the children’s toy G.I. Joe is named after a pigeon killed in the line of duty during World War II.
Homing pigeon racing hit a peak in the 1980s in Brooklyn and was made famous in part because of Mike Tyson’s interest in the sport. Some races are up to 500 miles, and pigeon owners can earn thousands in winnings. Researchers debate how the birds find their way home from such long distances, but most say it’s some combination of using the earth’s magnetic field, recognizing landmarks and their sense of smell.

Raising pigeons
Aponte and Pagan grew up just a few blocks from each other in eastern Brooklyn, during the heyday of pigeon racing. During that time, in addition to racing the pigeons, people would wander the city or wait on their rooftops to try to catch other people’s pigeons to sell.
“My father didn’t like it,” Aponte said. “He used to see that we used to get up early in the morning and try to catch other people’s pigeons. So then he used to get up earlier than us, because he was already up at five o’clock to go to work. He started going up in the backyard, and he started watching us … And then he got hooked on it himself.”
Aponte started raising pigeons on the roof of his family’s Brooklyn apartment when he was 12. He and his older brother would rise early to feed the birds.

At first, they kept it a secret between brothers, and when their father found out, he made them move the operation to a backyard coop. They’d get up early in the morning to travel to the other side of Long Island and buy birds, typically for $1.25 each.
As their business grew, every Sunday, they returned with about 200 birds to sell to neighbors, earning about 75 cents per bird. 
Meanwhile, at 5 years old, Pagan found a pigeon with a broken wing. He decided to capture it and nurse it back to health. That first bird was more of a pet — Pagan put a collar on it and took it for walks around the neighborhood. Over time, he and his brothers’ interest in pigeons grew, as did their new flock of racing birds. 
“I grew up with it,” Pagan said.
Their neighborhoods at the time were rough, Pagan and Aponte said. They watched many friends join gangs, start using or dealing drugs and eventually die young, violent deaths.
“Eventually you’re going to get caught in the system, and boom,” Pagan said. “It kept me from that.”

Breeding champions
For Aponte, the interest never waned. He kept raising pigeons throughout his childhood, into adulthood. When he moved to New Britain, he was able to expand the number of birds he kept. Now he has about 200. 
He keeps track of them based on the numbers attached to small bands around their legs, and it is clear: they’re not pets. He treats the birds well, but it’s more about the sport than emotional connection.
When his daughter was young, he let her keep one pigeon as a pet. The pigeon, named Tony, sat on his daughter’s shoulder while she moved through the house, dove into the suds while she washed dishes and defended her from any other animals he saw as threats that entered the yard.
In the early 2000s, Pagan moved to New Britain. He’d given up pigeon racing in his youth, but his brother had kept going. After his brother’s 2022 death, Pagan reluctantly gave away the last of the family’s flock. He didn’t know what to do with them or whether there would be a community of other pigeon people in New Britain to embrace him.

Over the next months, Pagan noticed a trend in the sky above his house. A flock of pigeons swooped in wide circles over the neighborhood, and he even saw the telltale “dropper pigeon,” or the pigeon that stays home until its racing friends draw close, then flies up and down swiftly to show them the way home and speed up their landing.
These weren’t the gray creatures that gather on sidewalks, littering New York City buildings in poop. These were larger, more graceful birds. These were racing pigeons. He decided to follow them home one day, tracing where their soaring loops ended, to find himself at Aponte’s house.
“I want to see my pigeon coming home. I want to see my training and how I train my birds to become champions,” Aponte said.

And he’s bred his birds to be champions. The process is a combination of science and instinct. The pigeon owners hope the hatchlings get larger, stronger wings, prettier colors. Some breeders say the birds’ eye color is the best way to tell a champion from the rest, but Aponte and Pagan disagree.
It’s all in the wings, the way they hold themselves, they say. And stretching out one of Aponte’s bird’s wings, allowing the light to filter through the black and white bars across its feathers, the men agree. This is a good racing bird.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PIGEONS-0821-DE-SONY-318-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-21 05:57:31.871504

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)COTTONWOOD FALLS — Just about where a visitor first sets foot inside the Chase County Courthouse a letter was found in 1950, when workmen were replacing the hardwood floor in the main hallway.
The message was slipped into a crack between the boards the last time the floor was replaced, in 1924.
“This beautiful bright February day Mr. Levi Chandler, the county treasurer, and the janitor, Harry Hudson, are laying a hardwood floor in the courthouse hall,” the letter began. “Mr. Chandler is doing the work for nothing if the commissioners will let the county pay for the material.”
The letter was written by the treasurer’s wife, Carrie Breese Chandler.
The courthouse had been completed in 1873, and the floor of the hallway had been worn nearly to splinters by tides of Chase Countians coming to pay their property taxes, to register or transfer deeds, to appear in court, to be jailed in the basement, and to marry and sometimes divorce. The building is now a Kansas icon, and the oldest working example in the state, but when Carrie wrote the letter a century ago it was already an old building in need of repair.
I was thinking about Carrie’s letter and the responsibilities of county office when I entered the courthouse on Monday, Sept. 15, and took the stairs to the courtroom on the second floor. The local Republican committee had called a convention there to nominate an interim replacement for Dow Wilson, who resigned early this month after financial “irregularities” in his department were reported.
The last time I had been in the courtroom was 14 years ago, when Kim and I had been married by a local judge. We didn’t live in Chase County, but in the county next door. Being wed in the oldest working courthouse in Kansas in a county made famous for its sense of place seemed a promising start. Five thousand days later, it still does. Just about everything appeared the same in the courtroom. Did I remember the sign taped to one door that said “JAIL,” with a down arrow? Surely it was a new sign, perhaps made for tours.
I’ve written about Chase County back in 2021, when I questioned the morality of the county running a for-profit detention center. In May of this year I revisited the topic, as the 148-bed lockup was the last and largest ICE-contracted jail facility in Kansas. The detention center is separate from the courthouse, five or six blocks to the southeast on Kansas Highway 177. If there are tours of that facility, they aren’t advertised. But that is another matter.
On Monday, I was in Chase County to observe government at its most fundamental level. Oh, I asked the questions most journalists would ask, the how manys and whens — and I was curious about Wilson, the treasurer who had resigned — but mostly I was looking for clues to an unasked question.
Who are we in 2025?
Your neighborhood may not resemble Chase County — I know mine on Constitution Street doesn’t — but that’s OK. There are many corners in Kansas, from the town of Nicodemus founded by formerly enslaved people to the Hispanic majority in Dodge City to the historically liberal college town of Lawrence. They all have some lesson to offer.
There are 2,572 people in Chase County, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and 88% of them are white. The median household income is $54,518, significantly lower than the state average. The county also skews slightly older than the rest of Kansas, with a median age of 45.
Republicans hold every elected post in the county, with the exception of a couple of township officials. Of 1,462 votes cast in the 2024 general election, 75% went to Trump. The county had a 2024 budget of $7 million, with an additional $5.4 million for the detention center.
Before the meeting I had haunted Broadway Street, that town’s long main street with the picturesque courthouse at the end, looking for a place where local residents gathered for coffee and talk. But the place I had remembered, the Emma Chase cafe, was gone. Instead, I found a group at the local Senior Center.
It was similar to what William Least Heat-Moon recounted finding in his 1991 book about Chase County, “PrairyErth.” The Emma Chase, he said, was closed and reopened and closed again, and the only place to find a cup of coffee on Broadway was at the Senior Citizen’s Center.
“Cottonwood Falls is probably not dying, but without the courthouse that issue would be moot,” Heat-Moon noted. “Of the thirty enterprises along Broadway, the one commercial street, half are federal, state, or county offices.”
More than three decades later, Cottonwood Falls is still probably not dying.
At the senior’s center I sat with a group of men in coveralls and work clothes ranging in age, I’m guessing from about 40 to more than 70. They allowed it would be all right to ask a few questions, but none of them wanted their names to be used.
I asked about Dow Wilson and the group exchanged tight smiles.
Wilson had been elected treasurer in 2017 (as a Republican, of course) and served a time as jail administrator. All the men knew him or his family and some of them had worked for him at the detention center. He may or may not have had a new job with the state. He had won it big at a casino. And he was still on the board of the Flint Hills Rodeo Association. Held in nearby Strong City, it’s the oldest consecutive running rodeo in Kansas.
All of the men knew about the investigation into the finances of the treasurer’s department. None of them said an unkind word about Wilson.
Wilson lost last year’s primary election to Bernice Albers.
Albers, a native Kansan who moved to Cottonwood Falls in 1989 and taught high school business and English, won the nomination by 34 votes. She told me that she had considered Wilson a friend but had not spoken to him since he mounted a fierce write-in campaign for the 2024 general election.
Albers won easily, 879 to 521.
Unlike other county officers, the term for Kansas county treasurers begins on the second Tuesday in October following the election. While the clerk and sheriff and others began their new terms in January, Wilson had nearly a year ahead of him before handing over the keys. By August 2025, according to the Emporia Gazette, Wilson reportedly stopped keeping business hours, came in on weekends, and had hired a part-time employee to take up the slack.
He was still drawing his full salary of $46,469.
During the first week of August, he won $362,606 playing “Mississippi Stud” poker at the Prairie Band Casino at Mayetta, north of Topeka. Wilson had, according to a social media post by the casino featuring a photo of Wilson, won the progressive jackpot on a side bet with a royal flush, the best hand possible.
Then a bombshell came at the Aug. 29 meeting of the county commission.
“Sheriff Jacob Welsh and (County) Attorney Brian Henderson informed the Board that CPA Cindy Jensen had uncovered irregularities in the financial records with the Treasurer’s office during the annual audit,” according to the minutes of that meeting. “After research Jensen was unable to justify any allowable legal reason for the discrepancies. Jensen reached out to Chase County Treasurer Dow Wilson who said he would look into it but never got back to her.”
The amount in question was between $50,000 and $100,000. The county commission approved a forensic audit by a third party, at an estimated cost of up to $25,000. Welsh was also given access to all county bank accounts from 2022 to present.
Wilson resigned early this month.
Henderson, the county prosecutor, declined to comment on the investigation. The county clerk, Connie Pretzer, told me the commission had not yet received the 2024 audit from Jensen, so she was unable to provide a copy.
I reached Wilson by telephone.
“Hey buddy, I have no comment at this time,” he said.
But wouldn’t he like to tell his side of the story? Explain what happened? At least share some tips on playing Mississippi Stud? Anything?
“No.”
At the courtroom on Monday, the convention lasted 30 minutes. The lone nominee was treasure-elect Albers. After a short speech from her, the committee asked the public to step out while the party voted. Albers was selected to fill Wilson’s unexpired term, pending appointment from the governor.
After the meeting, Albers said she was optimistic because she had confidence in the treasurer’s staff. She also said she had not been privy to any of the details of the investigation.
“I’m kind of in a grey area, because at this point I don’t really have any authority,” she said. “For right now, I’m not a part of it. I know what I read in the newspaper.”
She said the allegations were shocking.
“When I ran, I just wanted to retire (from teaching) and do something different,” Albers said. “I didn’t really have any thoughts about what this might turn into. It’s been almost a year-and-a-half journey, and there have been so many ups and downs.”
I asked her what question she would most like answered.
“Are we all doing what we can to do what’s right for the people of Chase County?” she said.

As citizens we tend not to notice what goes on in government. No matter how old the building is, courthouses — and those people who hold offices inside them — are part of the background noise of our lives. Paying taxes, renewing car tags, dealing with jury duty notices are common experiences, whether we find them merely inconvenient or downright dreadful. You probably haven’t thought about the courthouse much unless you work there or have been summoned to one. But a working government is the infrastructure that makes our lives possible. And a functioning government requires the trust of the people it serves — and the willingness for the people to contribute to the greater good.
As Americans we tend to mythologize the past, to imagine that things were better a generation or even a century ago. As Kansans, we like to imagine that we are part of an unchanging frontier heritage, and the Chase County Courthouse is part of that gospel.
It’s pleasant to visit Cottonwood Falls and walk Broadway and admire the postcard courthouse at the end where you can still enter without having to go through a metal detector. But if you actually lived in Chase County — not just visiting on a Saturday for a sunflower wedding — if you were one of the county’s citizens, more would be expected. It isn’t the local limestone or the native walnut railings that keep the courthouse vibrant, it’s people.
Chase County is part of the answer to who we are in 2025.
We are the overall-clad coffee drinkers at the Senior Center, the county attorney reticent about speaking to the press, the newly minted treasurer facing a problem whose outlines are yet unknown to the public. We’re the visitors seeking a bit of Americana, the predominantly Latino ICE detainees in the detention center, the journalist from just out of town who asks a lot of questions. We’re also the former county official at the center of a gathering storm.
We are in a period of transition, buffeted by forces both economic and partisan, and sometimes of our own making, and whether we find our way through in a form that will be recognizable as American to subsequent generations depends on how we treat each other.
It’s the essence of citizenship.
Heat-Moon became a temporary citizen of the county and contributed to the greater good in his own way, by producing what he called a “deep map.” Some of the residents I met at the Senior Center remembered the writer, and they allowed he got some things right.
“A Kansas City reporter once called Cottonwood Falls a dusty jewel, but it has more fundamental substance, more usefulness than that,” Heat-Moon wrote. “Rather, it’s a chiseled block of native stone, burnt by the sun, otherwise plain, practical, humble, and ordinary except for the tarrying past that each year makes Cottonwood stand out a little more from other Flint Hills towns either dying or embracing some prostitute of progress.”
If Cottonwood Falls ever turns the 1873 courthouse into a museum or something other than a working building, it will embrace probably dying rather than probably not. The courthouse is a living, functioning thing, a constant in the lives of Chase County residents.
In the 1924 letter that Carrie Breese Chandler slipped between the new boards in the courthouse hallway, she recalled how the courthouse had always been a part of her life.
“I can remember as a small child, sitting in the east window on the third floor and seeing antelopes running on the hills east of town,” she recalled.
Elsewhere she recalled reading books at the courthouse, because that’s where the county library was located.
She finished the letter with this:
“There is a crack left where I can put this letter under the floor, so here it goes,” she said. “Good luck to the finder.”

I’ve seen others shave or put on makeup. Give me a break!","How many of you remember “Car Talk”, the wildly popular NPR show with Tom and Ray Magliozzi, also known as “Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers?” Not only were they brothers, but both graduated from MIT. They were walking encyclopedias of automotive wisdom. And common sense.
To them, car safety meant more than just mechanics. It meant drivers should be smart about their motoring. Their popular bumper sticker read “Drive Now, Talk Later.”


They meant talking on cellphones, of course. But to update their mantra you could add “Text Later.”
That’s actually the law in Connecticut: All drivers must use hands-free devices for phone calls, and it is illegal to text or use any hand-held mobile device while operating a motor vehicle. If you’re under age 18 you’re not allowed to use any cellphone, hands-free or otherwise, while driving.
Last year’s “Put the phone away or pay” campaign in East Hartford and Manchester saw 365 tickets issued in a single month while state police tallied almost 600 citations in the same period. And we’re talking a $200 to $625 fine.
But I see it every day… people can’t put down their phones. I’m behind a guy at a red light.  It changes to green and he doesn’t move, obviously checking his phone. A slight tap on the horn (after a very patient 10 seconds) and he finally takes off.
Are we all so addicted? I honestly wonder what parents with an SUV full of kids are thinking when they drive down busy streets juggling a latte in one hand and a cellphone in the other.
Once, when stuck in crawling traffic on I-95, I actually saw a guy reading a book. I’ve seen other drivers shaving or putting on make-up. Give me a break! But I’d carry that message of attentive commuting to other travel environments as well, especially on the train.
Several years ago, while serving on the CT Rail Commuter Council, I tried to persuade Metro-North to establish “quiet cars” on their trains… cellphone free environments where riders seeking peace wouldn’t need to hear some self-centered hedge-fund dealer yelling at his trading desk in a voice that carries through the entire car.
“Hey. It’s me.” Who cares? “I’m on the train.” Yeah, I know. “Just thought I’d check in on that last trade.” I wish I could check out.
Years after Amtrak and other commuter rail systems adopted “quiet cars,” Metro-North finally agreed to give it a try in 2011. But they never enforced the rules and dropped the plan, using Covid as the excuse.
If we used to have smoking and non-smoking cars, why can’t we have “quiet cars” as well?  The problems of annoying chatter persist. A ticket on the train buys you transportation, not the right to annoy your fellow passengers with a recitation of your woes.
A friend on Metro-North says she was seated next to a woman on the phone complaining to a friend about her day and a splitting headache. When she hung up my friend asked if she needed a Tylenol. Cell-lady gave her a “Hrumph” and accused her of eavesdropping.
What’s the proper etiquette for cellphone use on the train?
Try to make the call short and at a low speaking volume, and cup your hand around the mouthpiece. If a longer call is necessary, get out of your seat and talk in the vestibule. And to make sure that incoming calls don’t bother anyone, leave your phone on vibrate.
It’s just a matter of consideration of your fellow riders.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cell-phone-in-drivers-hand-e1758305073639.jpg,,,2025-09-21 04:56:08.825528

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk — and the national response — was a major talking point Saturday at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition fall banquet for GOP speakers, who said his shooting was a call to action for Republicans.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Iowa Republicans shared their memories of the Turning Point USA cofounder at the annual fundraiser held in Des Moines. The event began with a moment of silence and prayer for Kirk and a memorial video.
The fatal shooting of Kirk on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University has fueled a national discussion among politicians and others about the need to prevent future instances of political violence and lower polarization. There has also been a significant push to condemn and pursue punishments for people who celebrate or make controversial statements about the right-wing influencer, including in Iowa, where the Board of Regents directed state universities to investigate social media posts allegedly made by employees about Kirk.

Many on the slate of  Republican speakers shared their personal experiences with Kirk. Noem, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson shared stories of their children watching videos of Kirk’s speeches and debates online, and the importance of defending free speech in the wake of his death.
Noem said she stayed in close contact with Kirk during her time in public service, and shared a story of getting a text message from him the day before he was killed.
“When I went back to look at what the last text was that I had gotten from him, I realized I hadn’t replied to it,” Noem said. “He had sent it to me the day before he passed away, and he said, ‘We have to hold these mayors and governors accountable.’ We have to hold them accountable. And I was traveling and meeting with other security ministers from other countries, and I had completely missed it. And I will forever be sick that I didn’t respond to him.”
She said she would have told Kirk, “I’m on it,” and added, “I think he knows that.”
Noem, as well as Moreno, are planning to attend the memorial service for Kirk, scheduled for Sunday in Glendale, Arizona. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance will be in attendance, as will many other top Republican leaders from across the country. Moreno also shared his experience meeting Kirk, who asked him for support in founding Turning Point USA, and added,  “it hasn’t quite hit yet that Charlie’s gone.”
He said Kirk’s killing is in part the result of the U.S. losing “its moral center of spirituality.”
“I think what he would hope for us, more than anything else, is that we literally imagine this as a quite literal turning point in our country’s history,” Moreno said. “Where we just say, ‘We’re not going to allow this to happen. We will not lose this country for the next generation. We will do everything possible to spread the word, always speak our minds, defend free speech and absolutely refuse to cede an inch to the lunatics that would take over this country.'”
Ernst said at the event the loss of spirituality, which Moreno called an “empty hole” in many people, is “rampant across the folks on the left in the Democratic Party.”

“They are consumed by that darkness and that hole,” Ernst said. “And that’s why it is so easy to embrace abortion — abortion on demand. But it’s also been very easy for them to be swallowed in that darkness and not valuing life, where they believe they can go out and take a life when they disagree with that person’s position. And we saw that quite clearly a week and a half ago with the murder of Charlie Kirk.”
Conservative CNN political commentator Scott Jennings, who gave the keynote address for the event, also linked Democrats and left-wing beliefs with Kirk’s death. He said the Democratic Party wants to “control everything,” from speech to acceptable vehicles and stoves.
“They want government to make decisions that you should be making for yourself and for your family,” Jennings said. “And if you disagree, if you speak up, if you push back, as a matter of politics, or even as a matter of faith? Well, we saw what happened to Charlie. We saw what happened nearly to our president last summer. We saw what happened in Minneapolis. We saw what happened in Nashville. Ladies and gentlemen, I submit to you tonight we have seen enough – enough.”


Ernst addresses her retirement
Ernst also made comments at the fundraiser about her decision not to run for reelection in 2026 in one of her first public appearances since announcing her exit from the race. She said she was leaving the office to devote time with her family, in addition to bringing up a vow she made during her 2014 campaign to only serve two terms in the U.S. Senate.
“I also had made a commitment early on that I would serve two terms,” Ernst said. “And so I have term limited myself and will be stepping aside because I think it’s the right thing to do for the next generation.”Ernst said she supported Hinson’s campaign for the position she currently holds, saying, “that seat belongs to you, the seat that I currently occupy.”

Federal authorities have not found evidence linking the man charged with the shooting, Tyler Robinson, to left-wing organizations, according to NBC News.
As politicians shared their memories and thoughts on the incident, Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed also invoked Kirk, as well as Trump, who has faced assassination attempts, as he asked for financial support for the organization.
“I want you to think of the price that Charlie Kirk paid last Wednesday,” Reed said. “He bore the ultimate burden. He paid the ultimate price. I want you to think about what President Trump and his family have been put through in the last 10 years — indicted, they tried to bankrupt him, they debanked the Trump Organization, they impeached him twice. And then after they did all that, they tried to kill him. You see, if you’re not willing to put it all on the line, this goes away.”
Speakers tout Trump immigration policies
In addition to speaking about Kirk, immigration was a major topic for speakers at the event. Noem said Kirk was one of her biggest supporters in implementing Trump’s immigration and deportation policies at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and spoke about her work with the president on his promises to increase border security and “build the wall.”
Moreno, who was born in Columbia and immigrated with his family to the U.S. at a young age, said he believes more Latino voters will begin voting for conservatives in upcoming elections, saying many people in these communities have Republican values, on issues like faith, education, and on LGBTQ+ issues, saying, “there is no word for transgenderism in Spanish” and “family means a mom and dad together, married.”

He also said he believed most legal immigrants from central and South America shared his perspective on immigration. He said it is “an honor to be welcomed to this country” legally, and that allowing undocumented immigrants to gain citizenship outside the established immigration process is insulting to those who went through proper channels.
“Imagine that somebody takes away that honor from you, and the way they take that honor away from you is by allowing people to come here illegally and then reward them,” Moreno said. “Let the people skip you in the line be the ones who are somehow sympathetic — when in reality, you know, people do not hire illegal migrants because they’re compassionate about illegals. They want to take advantage of those people, and that is the most horrifying idea that the Democrat Party has today. I find it insulting and I find it extremely demeaning.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — While Byron Donalds hasn’t received the backing of Gov. Ron DeSantis in his quest to succeed him as governor of Florida next year, the U.S. House member from Naples has no problem showering the love on the state’s chief executive.
“We have the best governor in America right now,” Donalds said Saturday during a campaign appearance in Tampa. “I don’t play political games. He’s the best. We have to build on what he has done and take our state to a whole ‘nother level.”
Donalds, the Trump-endorsed early frontrunner for the Republican nomination for governor next year, got deep into policy prescriptions while addressing a crowd of at least 150 people who gathered at La Teresita, a Cuban eatery in the city’s Hispanic district.
The candidate spent nearly half of his hour-long visit answering questions submitted in advance by members of the audience.
The property tax issue
One such query asked whether he would support a proposal on the 2026 November ballot to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes “without all the legal jargon where one can understand in simple terms what they’re voting for?”
“That second part is going to be really hard,” Donalds immediately responded.
“Would I love to eliminate property taxes? Yes,” he said. However: “If we eliminate property taxes in the state of Florida, we’d have to double the sales tax.”
He went on to say that doubling the 6% sales tax statewide would lead to a decrease in tourism from working people and thus isn’t a real option (the co-chair of the select committee in the Florida House studying the issue has already said that the total elimination of property taxes is a non-starter).
Instead, Donalds offered a couple of remedies — included raising the homestead exemption from $50,000 to between $300,000 and $400,000.
“So, you do that on homesteaded property, and then you create a harder cap that would have to apply for the school taxes,” he said. “Because Save Our Homes and all the other homesteaded exemptions do not apply to school districts. They only apply to the cities and the counties. … It has to apply to [school] districts as well to see a real decrease in property taxes.”
Another suggestion he made was that the millage rate assessed by local governments should instead be set by the county tax collector.
And he said that if elected he would continue the DOGE efforts enacted by Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia. “Everybody’s budget is going to be examined. Every year. All the time. Not just local. But state as well.”
He called the idea of property tax reform a step in the right direction, ultimately, “because at the end of the day, we can’t have people being priced out of their homes. We can’t have it. I don’t care what project you got going on in your local government. If you’re pricing people out, then guess what? That’s a bad project. You need to go back to the drawing board.”
He’s no longer all about charter schools
Donalds, who served in the Legislature from 2016-2020 before moving on to Congress, said he’s evolved in his thinking on one form of education policy.
“When I first got to the Legislature, I used to think that charter schools were the only thing that could change education, and I thought it was ‘all charters, all the time,’” he said.
And now?
“I’ve gotten off of that,” he said. “I’m agnostic when it comes to schools. In terms of which schools are allowed and which schools are not. That’s one of the reasons why I am such a vehement supporter and believer in parental empowerment and true school choice.”
He said state educators need to start looking at so-called “co-locational schools” as a remedy for school districts suddenly populated with fewer students but the same number of physical buildings.
“If there’s a fledgling charter school, a fledgling private school, or a fledgling parochial religious school and they’re trying to get started and parents are choosing them, why is the school district having a building that’s half empty? Co-locate the schools. Allow those fledgling schools to come up.”
And he said it’s time to figure out how to build nonpublic school infrastructure, an idea he acknowledges is “outside the box.”
“If our parents are choosing nonpublic options, and we fund education because we believe that funding education is in the interest of the state and the future of the state, then we are going to have to look at solutions for nonpublic schools,” he said. “I think you can do it in a way that the taxpayer actually gets a semblance of a return and they’re not left holding the bag. So there’s a way to be able to deliver that.”
Another idea? Microschools, which has been described by EdChoice as a reimagining of the one-room schoolhouse, with small class sizes and curricula tailored to fit the needs of each class.
“Parents are saying, ‘You know what, we’re going to do a microschool. I think we should be open to all of that,” he said.  Florida lawmakers passed a bill (HB 1285) in the 2024 session that opened more options for school locations in the state. The measure allows private charter and microschools to rent or buy spaces like churches, libraries, community centers, theaters, or museums in the state to operate in.
One proposal that Donalds doesn’t appear to be on the same wavelength with Gov. DeSantis is to ban all vaccine mandates in Florida.
“We’re going to look at all the things that are rulemaking, not statutory,” he told the Phoenix as he exited the stage. “Stuff that’s statutory like mRNA vaccines? Probably not going to touch that.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-9-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-09-20 17:57:13.137512

Newsom signed laws meant to protect immigrants during President Trump's extensive deportation program. Some of the measures raise constitutional questions and likely will be challenged.,"In summary
Gov. Newsom signed laws meant to protect immigrants during President Trump’s extensive deportation program. Some of the measures raise constitutional questions and likely will be challenged.


Gov. Gavin Newsom today signed a set of bills meant to check the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown in California, including a first-in-the nation measure to prohibit officers from wearing masks and others that limit their access to schools and hospitals. 
The new laws echo the “resistance” measures California adopted during the first administration, when it passed a so-called sanctuary law to limit local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration agents, among other policies. 
“Immigrants have rights and we have the right to stand up and push back,” Newsom said at an event in Los Angeles where he signed the legislation.
President Trump promised a historic deportation effort and assault on sanctuary-style policies when he took office for the second time. His administration criticized the state’s new immigration laws even before Newsom signed them. 
The Department of Homeland Security earlier this week called on Newsom to veto the mask bill — one of the more contentious pieces of immigration legislation — calling it “despicable.” 
“Once again sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a Sept. 16 press release.
California may struggle to enforce the new laws, some of which have already raised constitutional questions around the state’s role in federal operations, but lawmakers maintain that they are legally defensible. 
California political consultant Mike Madrid said in signing the laws Newsom is showing that he can stand up and fight, whether or not he has a chance of winning. 
“In this moment, when there are very few cards to play for state governments and state legislatures, California has done what no other state has done: establish itself as the tip of the spear on resisting a lot of these efforts that are an affront to its values,” said Madrid, a longtime Republican consultant who co-founded the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. 
“99% of this is the purview of the federal government. So a lot of it is just symbolic, but symbolism matters. It’s both politically astute but also morally right,” he said. 
The package of bills Newsom signed included:

Assembly Bill 49 prohibits schools from allowing immigration enforcement officers on campus without a warrant.
Senate Bill 627 widely prohibits federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. 
Senate Bill 805 requires that law enforcement officers identify themselves while conducting their duties, with some exceptions. 
Senate Bill 81 prohibits immigration enforcement from entering restricted areas of a health facility without a judicial warrant or court order. 
Senate Bill 98 requires schools and higher education institutions to send community notifications when immigration enforcement is on campus, and prohibits immigration enforcement from entering certain areas without a judicial warrant or court order.

California Democrats began drafting immigration-related bills almost as soon Trump took office in January. Those efforts accelerated after the Trump administration launched aggressive immigration sweeps throughout Los Angeles, which led to weeks of protests and a subsequent National Guard deployment.
“All of this legislative resistance is to protect Angelenos from their own federal government. That is profound,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference with Newsom and other Democratic leaders.
Will the laws make a difference?
Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said the legislation may have a marginal impact on federal immigration enforcement operations.
In 2018, for instance, California passed a law to restrict immigration arrests at superior court buildings. That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from detaining people at those courts this year.
“The federal government is going to continue doing what it’s doing, in one form or another,” he said. “I do think the legislation gives some hope and optimism to communities that feel under fire, vulnerable and basically hated by the federal government.”
Shiu-Ming Cheer, deputy director at California Immigrant Policy Center, remains hopeful that the package of bills will ensure safety for people attending school and accessing health care.
“With most laws, there has to be really vigorous monitoring, both by the state as well as by advocates to ensure that it’s truly being implemented and followed,” she said. 
California police opposed mask ban
The most controversial bill in the package was Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener’s proposal to widely ban federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. The law, also known as the “No Secret Police Act,” does not apply to certain forms of face coverings, such as face shields, and it exempts some officers, including those who are undercover. Officers who violate the law will face an infraction or misdemeanor.
Wiener and Democratic Sens. Jesse Arreguín, Sasha Pérez and Aisha Wahab championed the legislation after seeing footage of masked and unidentifiable agents carrying out operations.
“ICE’s recklessness creates chaos as agents run around with what are effectively ski masks and no identification, grabbing people, throwing them in unmarked vehicles, and disappearing them,” Wiener of San Francisco said at a legislative hearing in August. “When law enforcement officers hide their identities, it destroys community trust.”

California’s law enforcement groups widely opposed the bill, arguing it will largely apply to local police, rather than federal agents, because the federal government is likely to sue on constitutional grounds. 
“It’s using an emotionally charged issue on a federal level to pass a bill that will only affect local peace officers,” said Brian Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, an umbrella labor organization that lobbies on behalf of police unions. “You’re upset with the feds, but you’re going to punish us.”
Other law enforcement experts echoed those concerns, arguing that it’s illegal to interfere with federal operations. 
“California cops are not going to enforce this law,” said Ed Obayashi, a longtime California police officer who now is a special prosecutor and policy adviser to the Modoc County Sheriff’s Office. “You cannot regulate lawful federal conduct, whether the Legislature likes it or not.” 
The law allows officers to be sued personally for “tortious conduct,” including if they assault or falsely arrest someone while masked. 
“Private enforcement could be the avenue where enforcement is the likeliest,” said Johnson.
The bill caused hours of contentious debate on the Senate and Assembly floors, with many Republicans calling it misguided. 
“My immigrant family is not afraid” of ramped-up immigration enforcement, Fresno Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa said, “because we did not break the law.”
But Democrats were animated because just days before, the U.S. Supreme Court had sided with the Trump administration and ICE for conducting roving sweeps through Los Angeles, apparently catching bystander day laborers or anyone who appeared Latino in their dragnet. The bill, they said, was their way of pushing back.
“We need a full front defense for the violence that is coming from this regime,” said Hector Pereyra, policy manager for the nonprofit Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, which co-sponsored the mask bill and another bill to protect the private data of street vendors. “We have to respond with a united front of strength and aggressiveness, not of passiveness.”

A federal judge in Missoula this week found that the U.S. Forest Service violated the law when authorizing expanded commercial livestock grazing leases north of Yellowstone National Park.  
In an order handed down Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy found that an Environmental Assessment conducted by the Forest Service was insufficient, as it did not adequately address the impacts to grizzly bears, an endangered species. 
“Despite knowing that livestock conflict remains a leading cause of death for grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Forest Service sought to expand cattle grazing on public lands surrounding the National Park,” said Patrick Kelly, Montana director with Western Watersheds Project, in a press release. “Judge Molloy’s decision has thankfully halted this misguided and illegal effort, likely preventing the deaths of many more grizzly bears.”
The order affirmed an earlier decision by federal judge Kathleen DeSoto.
Western Watersheds Project led a coalition of conservation groups in filing the lawsuit against the chief of the U.S. Forest Service and several federal agencies in 2022, arguing the government failed to consider the effects of expanded cattle grazing north of Yellowstone National Park on grizzlies under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.
The groups alleged that greenlighting grazing on an additional 1,356 acres for cows, along with a longer stock season with young calves, would lead to increased conflicts with grizzlies and greater mortality for the bears. 
The lawsuit notes portions of the six grazing allotments in question are in the grizzly bears’ Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem recovery zone. 
Arguing before Judge DeSoto last fall, a lawyer for the conservation groups, Matthew Bishop, said the Forest Service’s analysis of impacts was so cursory, it should at the very least be redone: “We heard more today on connectivity (for grizzly bears) than what’s in the record.”
But the Forest Service argued that it took a “hard look” at potential impacts on grizzlies as is required under NEPA, and the environmental assessment found limited impacts to the species’ population in the area. Attorneys for the federal government argued that because the proposed scope of grazing is limited, the impacts to grizzlies was also limited. 
This spring, DeSoto ruled in favor of the conservation groups. Under NEPA, she wrote, the federal government had failed to consider how the expanded grazing, and the cumulative effects of both public and private activities in the area, might affect connectivity of grizzly populations, a key to the species’ recovery and survival. She also found the agency failed to prepare an environmental impact statement, which is required by NEPA. 
However, she dismissed part of the complaint that the federal government had violated the Endangered Species Act. 
Both parties objected to parts of DeSoto’s ruling, but Molloy’s September order affirmed the decision. 
The court ultimately remanded the decision to the Forest Service to prepare a new analysis and vacated the decision to expand grazing on the six allotments. 
“The science is clear: grizzly bears need safe, livestock-free passage between population cores in order to fully recover,” said Lizzy Pennock, carnivore coexistence attorney at WildEarth Guardians, in a press statement. “We are grateful the judge redirected the U.S. Forest Service toward the best available science and its legal responsibility to protect wildlife.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A long-running effort to broaden Colorado’s air pollution rules to include health limits on lesser-known hazards took another step forward on Friday, but advocates were again left frustrated by what they called a “missed opportunity” to go further.
Members of the state Air Quality Control Commission voted 8-0 to adopt an updated set of rules known as Regulation No. 30, establishing benchmarks for a group of “priority toxic air contaminants” identified by the commission earlier this year. The new health standards still need to be approved by the state Legislature, and they won’t be used in permitting or regulatory proceedings for at least another year.
Their enshrinement in Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment rules is another milestone for environmental and community groups that have fought for them for years — but it came with a reminder of the power that the business lobby has wielded in opposing those efforts at the state Capitol and beyond. Commissioners opted for a set of higher limits proposed by industry groups, rather than the lower limits proposed by environmental groups or a middle-ground position endorsed by CDPHE staff.

“This was a missed opportunity for the Commission to put community health first,” Patricia Garica-Nelson, an activist with nonprofit environmental organization GreenLatinos, said in a statement. “Coloradans came forward with powerful stories about the direct harm they face from toxic air pollution, yet decision-makers still chose weaker standards for most contaminants.”
The new rule’s five priority contaminants, also known as “air toxics,” were identified by state regulators with input from a scientific advisory group. They are among a class of hundreds of compounds classified as hazardous air pollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, however, only sets federal health standards for a core group of six well-known “criteria” pollutants, including ozone and carbon monoxide, which are the target of extensive regulations under the Clean Air Act.










These exposures don’t act alone — they pile up, creating cumulative harms that send kids, the elderly, outdoor workers, and families living close to oil and gas wells to the ER and even shorten lives.


– Dr. Maria Chansky, advocate with Healthy Air and Water Colorado


In the absence of federal limits, Colorado has lagged behind other states in establishing its own state-level air toxics rules, and CDPHE came under scrutiny for allowing industrial pollution sources like Suncor Energy’s Commerce City oil refinery to effectively set their own emissions limits. After several years of trying, lawmakers representing Denver-area communities succeeded in passing a 2022 law directing the AQCC to begin regulating certain air toxics.
The five priority contaminants identified in the new rules are:

Benzene, a volatile organic compound often associated with oil and gas production and linked to leukemia and other adverse health effects
Hexavalent chromium, often emitted by industrial metal production and linked to lung cancer and respiratory problems
Ethylene oxide, often used to sterilize medical equipment and linked to cancers and respiratory problems
Formaldehyde, often associated with the production of wood products and resins and linked to cancers and other adverse health effects
Hydrogen sulfide, often associated with oil and gas production, wastewater and food processing plants, and linked to a variety of adverse health effects

High levels of hydrogen sulfide are believed to have caused the deaths of six people killed in an incident at a dairy farm in Weld County last month.
State law requires the AQCC to adopt “emission control regulations” pertaining to priority air toxics by April 30. CDPHE staff didn’t perform an economic impact analysis on the rule adopted Friday, they wrote, because for now it will have “no regulatory impact on any person, facility, or activity.”
“Once approved by the General Assembly, the health-based standards may be integrated into regulatory and/or permitting requirements,” staff wrote. “An analysis of potential economic impacts will be done at that time.”
The AQCC, a volunteer commission appointed by the governor, set the new standards by drawing on a variety of existing recommendations from EPA health assessments and regulations in other states. But members sided with industry groups in adopting a high “hazard quotient” for non-cancer exposure risks, rather than a lower quotient backed by CDPHE, which agency staff argued would account for cumulative exposures and provide “ample margin of safety, particularly for vulnerable groups.”
“These exposures don’t act alone — they pile up, creating cumulative harms that send kids, the elderly, outdoor workers, and families living close to oil and gas wells to the ER and even shorten lives,” Dr. Maria Chansky, a Glenwood Springs physician and advocate with Healthy Air and Water Colorado, said in a statement. “In light of ongoing federal environmental rollbacks, it is more important than ever that Colorado safeguard our air through strong health-based standards to curb harmful air toxics.”
Though he voted for the rule’s adoption, AQCC commissioner Jon Slutsky voiced uneasiness with siding against the calls of community advocates who testified before the commission about their experiences “living close to the problem.”
“When we have people in the community coming before us, time and time again … I think we have to do more than just listen to them,” Slutsky said. “We have to actually give them some love.”

Caldwell also emphasized his desire for transparency and teamwork in the caucus.
Caldwell replaces former Rep. Rose Pugliese, who resigned on Sept. 15. In her resignation letter, Pugliese cited a desire to spend more time with family and a “toxic” environment in the Legislature. She had a public quarrel with Democratic leadership on the last day of the recent special session over allegations that she covered up for a former lawmaker who shared an unprofessional photo of a Democratic lawmaker in a private group chat.
The Legislature reconvenes in January. Democrats have strong majorities in both chambers.

The decision from Circuit Judge Daniel Green concluded that lawmakers properly combined bans on gender-affirming treatments for minors with reproductive rights in the proposed constitutional amendment but misled voters with the ballot language.
Quoting a Western District Court of Appeals ruling from 2020, Green wrote that “it was insufficient and unfair for a summary statement to fail to ‘alert voters to that change in some fashion.’”
And the ballot language, he wrote, fails to alert voters that it would repeal the reproductive rights section of the Missouri Constitution approved in the 2024 election.
In the ruling, Green ordered Secretary of State Denny Hoskins to submit revised language within seven days. Green also found that the “fair ballot language” summary posted on Hoskins’ office website was misleading for also failing to state abortion would be banned in most cases, and ordered revisions to be submitted within seven days.
The challenge to the proposal, which will appear as Amendment 3 on a ballot next year, asked Green to throw it out entirely for combining abortion and gender-affirming care for minors under 18. 
During an August hearing, attorney Chuck Hatfield argued that the inclusion of the gender-affirming health care ban was “ballot candy” meant to win over more voters but is a separate issue from reproductive health care.
Green disagreed in his ruling, saying the two issues are closely related enough to meet constitutional requirements for a single subject. In a footnote, Green pointed to the website of the Columbia Planned Parenthood clinic, which lists abortion and gender-affirming care among the services provided.
It is the ballot language that does not mention the abortion rights repeal, that is “insufficient and unfair,” Green wrote.
Republican state Senate leaders shut down a Democratic filibuster in May to push the measure to the ballot. 
If approved by a majority of voters, the abortion ban amendment would repeal a citizen-led reproductive rights amendment that passed last November legalizing abortion in Missouri until the point of fetal viability and enshrining other reproductive rights in the constitution, including in-vitro fertilization and contraceptives.
The new amendment would reinstate an abortion ban, allowing limited exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomolies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
After Hoskins delivers the revised language, parties in the case will have three days to submit arguments on whether it satisfies legal requirements.

The Interior Department agency regulating offshore wind development asked a federal judge on Thursday to revoke a key approval for the SouthCoast Wind project — an approval granted by the same agency in January in the final days of the Biden administration.
If the federal government’s request is approved, it would deal another blow to the beleaguered project — which has been delayed at least two years due to the Trump administration — and the industry at large.
This is the second time in a week that the administration has sought a remand of an offshore wind project approval, the other being for Maryland’s US Wind project. It comes just weeks after the Interior Department in court filings expressed its intent to remand not only its approval for SouthCoast Wind, but also New England Wind — two important projects for Massachusetts and New Bedford.
While the January approval, formally termed the Construction and Operations Plan (COP), gave the green light for construction, SouthCoast Wind was still hamstrung by three outstanding federal permits, and no power purchase agreement with Massachusetts or Rhode Island.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management filed the motion as part of a lawsuit brought by the Town of Nantucket in March against BOEM and Interior’s approval of the project, which calls for up to 147 turbines and would sit about 20 miles south of Nantucket (and south of Vineyard Wind).
This latest move illustrates the growing role that lawsuits brought by municipalities and activist groups against offshore wind are playing in President Trump’s crackdown on the industry. Of the 20 or so actions and orders issued since January, one has directed federal attorneys to review pending litigation against projects and consider a remand of permits that the litigation contests.
“BOEM is reviewing its approvals associated with the Project and has determined, based on its review to date, that it wishes to reconsider its COP approval. That is reason enough to grant a remand,” the new motion states.
Nantucket is asking the federal government to “set aside” its record of decision approving SouthCoast Wind and restart its environmental review — a process that took more than three years to complete and culminated in key permits allowing the project to move toward construction.
In Thursday’s filing, the government suggested the town’s concerns (and lawsuit) may become moot: “BOEM likely will take a further agency action, and that action may affect — and possibly moot — Plaintiffs’ claims.”
The motion and a declaration filed by BOEM Deputy Director Matthew Giacona are littered with references to Trump’s day-one wind memo and the subsequent actions that it has borne.
This includes the withdrawal of a 2021 opinion on how the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) should be interpreted, and the reinstatement of an opinion from the first Trump administration on the law. The motion states that BOEM staff are reevaluating all agency decisions that relied on the since-withdrawn 2021 opinion, which also informed the approval of New England Wind.
Under the reinstated opinion, Giacona said, SouthCoast Wind’s COP approval may not be compliant with OCSLA.
“BOEM determined that it ‘may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause,’” the motion states. “BOEM also found that the Environmental Impact Statement and other record documents may have ‘understated or obfuscated impacts that could have subsequently been improperly weighed in making the determinations.’”
Giacona’s declaration also appears to call into question the lease itself, which SouthCoast Wind paid millions for and has been paying hundreds of thousands in annual payments to the federal government since.
He said the project-wide review, ordered under the day-one wind memo, “could result in identifying potential issues with SouthCoast’s lease” and that the timeline for that review is “uncertain.”
Ocean Winds North America, the project’s parent company, in a statement to The Light said it plans to “vigorously defend our permits in federal court.”
“SouthCoast Wind’s Construction and Operations Plan (COP) was approved … after a rigorous four-year review,” the statement read. “This review reflected an extensive public process that incorporated feedback from federal and state government agencies, commercial ocean users, Tribal Nations, and many other stakeholders. Stable permitting for American infrastructure projects should be of top concern for anyone who wants to see continued investment in the United States.”
SouthCoast Wind is an intervenor in the case and opposed the government’s motion. The project plans to use the Port of New Bedford for staging out of the Marine Commerce Terminal and for long-term operations and maintenance.
Mayor Jon Mitchell previously said a delay or cancellation of New England Wind and SouthCoast Wind could mean a loss of up to 200 jobs in the city.
According to Oceantic Network, an organization supporting the industry, SouthCoast Wind expects to invest $6 billion in the U.S. through wages for union labor; shipbuilding with a Louisiana port and shipbuilder; steel from Alabama and Kentucky; and investments in port infrastructure, including the New Bedford terminal.
Gov. Maura Healey, in an emailed statement Friday, said the project will create “thousands of good-paying jobs” and provide reliable, affordable power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses.
“This project has been thoroughly vetted and has already undergone years of expert review,” Healey said. “There is absolutely no need for the Trump Administration to reopen permitting processes and deny jobs, investment and energy power to the states.”
Healey’s office did not respond to a question as to whether it plans to intervene.
The request for a remand will be decided by a federal judge.
Per the federal government’s filing, “District courts have broad discretion to grant or deny remands and may deem a remand inappropriate ‘if the agency’s request appears to be frivolous or made in bad faith,’” but it also says courts “commonly” grant them.
As this plays out, more than a dozen states, including Massachusetts, are waiting on a federal judge to rule whether Trump’s first-day wind memo, the action underlying all of this, is unlawful. It’s unclear when that decision will come, and what scope of relief it could provide to the states, which are relying on the projects to meet climate mandates and rising grid demand.

By Ryan Colasanti, contributing Journalist
GREENWOOD, DE — Milford running back Andrew Sivels settled two yards behind his quarterback in the pistol formation with his pink gloves resting on his knees. Buccaneer quarterback Cayden Jarrett received the snap and turned toward Sivels.
Sivels took the handoff, took three steps to his left, paused as the running lane closed and redirected toward the middle of the field. Sivels’ patience paid off as a wide open running lane emerged, allowing him to sprint upfield for a 46-yard touchdown on Milford’s first offensive possession of the game.
Sivels scored four of the Buccaneers’ five touchdowns, leading Milford to its first win of the season, 35-0, over the Woodbridge Blue Raiders, Friday night.
Sivels, junior Tyjere Perry, and senior Gregory Lockett were a dominant trio on the ground. The three ball carriers combined for over 200 rushing yards and accounted for all five of Milford’s scores.
Four of the five touchdowns belonged to Sivels and the junior was responsible for over 120 of Milford’s rushing yards. Sivels’ ground totals were boosted by a 57-yard touchdown in the middle of the third quarter, adding to his long touchdown in the first. Sivels’ other two touchdowns came on shorter runs near the goal line as did Perry’s lone touchdown run on the Buccaneers’ opening possession out of halftime.
Jarrett’s right arm did a good job complementing the run game. Jarrett completed a few passes, including a deep pass down the right sideline to Jayden Williams for a gain of 32 yards that set up Perry’s touchdown run a few plays later. Williams made a tremendous catch, leaping over his defender to come down with the grab.
The Buccaneers’ defense fed off the energy of its offense and held the Blue Raiders without a score. Woodbridge was able to drive into the red zone a couple of times, but Milford’s defense stopped them before they could reach the end zone. The Buccaneers also forced a couple of takeaways in the first half that stalled any momentum Woodbridge developed.
The Buccaneers’ 35 points are the most they’ve scored this season, topping the 33 they scored in their first game of the season against Conrad. Milford’s victory breaks a stretch of four consecutive losses against Woodbridge dating back to right after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Blue Raiders will try and bounce back from this game as they travel to Abessinio Stadium next Thursday to take on a Howard team that beat Appoquinimack Friday night.

The numbers come from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which reports bird flu detections in eight commercial South Dakota flocks and one backyard flock in the state during the last 30 days. 
Meanwhile, South Dakota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said blue-winged teal, a species of duck, have been identified as carriers of this season’s virus. John Cooper, a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent and former state Game, Fish and Parks secretary, said it makes sense that the state would find itself combating bird flu early this year if teal are carrying it.
“Teal are traditionally our first migrators,” Cooper said.

Detections this early in the fall season are troubling, according to Thompson. The peak avian influenza seasons typically happen later during the fall and spring migration of wild birds, which can carry the virus without becoming sick.
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, the state Department of Health said “bird flu has the potential to be transmitted to humans from wild birds” but emphasized the risk to people remains low. 
The department pointed to federal guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which offers steps for hunters to reduce risks:

Gut and de-feather game birds in the field rather than at home and practice good hygiene to prevent disease spread.
Use dedicated tools for cleaning game, do not use the same tools around poultry, and wash and disinfect all tools and work surfaces afterward.
Wear gloves, a mask and eye protection when handling game birds.
Throw away the gloves and facemask afterward and wash hands with soap and water.
Cook meat to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

Commercial turkey products remain safe to eat thanks to existing food safety protocols in the industry, according to Thompson.
The bird flu depopulation process is federally mandated and involves killing all birds at affected sites to prevent the virus from spreading to nearby farms. Thompson said “foaming” is the most common method in turkey barns, where foam is sprayed atop turkeys inside the barn to suffocate them. 
She said the process is carried out with assistance from federal and state officials who oversee the work, with the federal government offering compensation for losses through indemnity payments. Those payments have totaled more than $1 billion nationally since 2020, according to an analysis by CBS News, including about $130 million in South Dakota.

Each has its own funding challenges. Some may put an emphasis on college preparation while others may seek to get students ready for the workforce. The beauty of local control is that it allows the school district patrons, through their school board, to decide how students should be educated.
That individuality is apparent in the way districts have approached student use of cellphones in the classroom. According to a South Dakota Searchlight survey and analysis of school district policies, about 60% of school districts in the state restrict cellphone use for at least part of the school day. About a third of districts take the further step of locking away students’ cellphones for at least a portion of the day.
While some schools may restrict student cellphone use in an effort to keep them from being distractions, in Wilmot the students are allowed to keep their phones as a way to teach them a lesson in responsibility. This contrasts quite a bit with the policy in other districts including Dupree, where high school students are required to put their cellphones in containers during the school day.
Three of five SD governor hopefuls endorse statewide approach to cellphones in classrooms

It’s that kind of difference, from school district to school district, that helps reflect the philosophy of educators, the needs of the individual communities and the strength of local control.
“There’s never going to be a one-size-fits-all,” said Dupree School District superintendent Brent Mareska.
Well, hold the phone.
One policy for every school district is exactly what three of the five candidates for governor are proposing. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Republican candidate for governor, said in a South Dakota Searchlight story that he would back a statewide prohibition on student access to cellphones during classes.
“The state government setting a broad-stroke policy and then having the execution of that strategy and management done at the local level will give us the best of both worlds,” Johnson said.
Of course, one of those worlds, in Pierre, would set the policy for all the school districts. Those districts, whether they like it or not, would have to carry it out, without regard for their current cellphone policy. A policy that may be working just fine for them.
South Dakota House Speaker Jon Hansen, another Republican candidate, would also support a statewide policy as a way for students to focus “on learning, not on distractions.” Democrat Robert Arnold, a 20-year-old college student who plans to run for governor, said a statewide policy would benefit students.
Another Republican candidate, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, said the decision on cellphone policy should be left up to school boards, though his approach seems more like a Mafia don than a governor: “As governor, I would absolutely lean on our local school boards to ban cellphones from the classroom.”

While Doeden would make school districts an offer they can’t refuse, Gov. Larry Rhoden, who has yet to declare his candidacy, is quizzing school leaders about whether they want their policy to come from the local level or the state. Some schools may welcome a state law, allowing them to put what could be an unpopular policy in place, all the while laying the blame at the feet of the Legislature.
Judging by the performance of the Legislature in 2025, it would be wise to leave decisions about education to school districts. A completely unscientific search of the Legislative Research Council website found that the Legislature considered 59 education bills this year. Among them were such winners as a failed requirement to display and add to the curriculum the Ten Commandments, a withdrawn effort to defund the Huron School District because of its bathroom policy, and a failed requirement to display the state seal.
A track record like that doesn’t inspire confidence in a Legislature or a governor who wants to make a one-size-fits-all cellphone policy. Obviously school districts are getting by just fine without a mandate from the state about how to regulate cellphones in the classroom. That’s how local control is supposed to work.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2158370531-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-20 09:59:12.315501

Jones, left, and Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell. Photos courtesy of Washington State University and University of Washington. For the first time in nearly a decade, Washington’s two largest universities welcomed new presidents within the same year. 
Elizabeth Cantwell became the first female president of Washington State University in April, and Robert J. Jones, in August, became the first Black president of the University of Washington. 
The two leaders made a joint appearance this week at the Association of Washington Business 2025 Policy Summit, in a panel mirroring one held at the summit in 2016. 
The summit brings together business leaders, policy experts and elected officials.  
During the panel, both university leaders lamented the breakdown of partnerships between universities and the federal government, and emphasized the need for more investment in higher education, especially in research.
“There’s an absolute bottom line for the time period that we’re in. If you continue to disrupt that bottom line, it will take decades to recover this nation to being the cutting edge for innovation, if we’re able to recover,” Jones said. 
Like most universities, Washington State University and the University of Washington each rely heavily on federal and state research dollars, as well as tuition, to maintain their operations. 
The money invested into research goes back to local economies, Cantwell said, adding that the research done at the University of Washington and Washington State University has helped drive the state’s economy for decades. 
“The ability to continue doing that is in jeopardy at the moment,” she added.
Jones and Cantwell both stressed the importance of continuing research into quantum computing and artificial intelligence. 
Both are developing fields that will become critical within the next decade, Jones and Cantwell said. 
“It’s not just about creating that technology. It’s: How do you also start to think about the research and innovation? How do you connect that to workforce development and opportunities for young people when they graduate to have jobs in this area?” Jones said. 
Washington is “incredibly well-positioned” to be a leader in quantum computing and AI research, Cantwell said. But amid ongoing state and federal budget pressures, further development in these fields will depend on how well institutions can collaborate rather than compete with each other.  
“There has to be this wide, deep collaboration among institutions that have the wherewithal to solve the problem,” Jones said. 
The presidents also acknowledged challenges around attracting students and the need to adjust their institutions’ offerings to cater to shifting workforce needs and to collaborate with K-12 leaders to increase high school graduation rates. 
Compared to fall 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, undergraduate enrollment this year  is down by about 4,600 students at Washington State University. At the University of Washington, it climbed by about 2,500 students between 2019 and the 2024-25 academic year.
Education leaders blame sluggish enrollment on drops in high school graduation rates and college readiness, but also the growing notion amongst students that college degrees aren’t valuable in the current economy. 
“A college degree is not just a personal benefit,” Jones said. “It’s a community benefit. It impacts all of us.”.
University leaders, Jones and Cantwell said, have a responsibility to work with K-12 educators to improve college readiness and to work with businesses to ensure students are learning the skills they need to get quality jobs. 
Teaching skills related to evolving technology like AI, as well as investing in training for specific trades, will likely be part of the solution, they said.  
“We all have, as public institutions, the obligation to provide the education that we have to the people who want it where they are and when they need it,” Cantwell said.  
Cantwell previously led Utah State University for 18 months and has held senior research positions at the University of Arizona and Arizona State University, as well as roles at several national laboratories. 
She pointed to Washington State University’s history as a land-grant institution, which receives money from the federal government for agricultural teaching and research, as a reason why she accepted the position. 
“There is a thread of history that is still meaningful today and meaningful into the future,” Cantwell said, calling Washington State University “one of the most iconic land grants in the entire country.” 
Jones joined the University of Washington following nine years as the chancellor of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and three years as president of the State University of New York at Albany. Before entering administration, he was a faculty member at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities for 34 years. 
“This is not my first rodeo, but it clearly will be my last,” Jones said, adding that he is excited to be “leading a university like the University of Washington at one of the most exciting but also most challenging periods in the history of all of our education.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uw-wsu-presidents-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-20 07:56:58.478410

The Quantifying Uncertainty and Action to Help Optimize Growth […],"Northern quahog clams. (Photo by NOAA Fisheries/Julie Rose)A bipartisan bill introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) aims to address the decline of the quahog and other shellfish populations on the East Coast — and the legislation even bears the name of Rhode Island’s official state shell.
The Quantifying Uncertainty and Action to Help Optimize Growth of Shellfish (QUAHOGS) Act would create a research task force of state and federal agency representatives, fishery management councils, and industry leaders dubbed the “East Coast Bivalve Research Task Force” to find out why fewer bivalves are in the water.
At its peak in 1959, nearly 5 million pounds of quahogs were harvested from Rhode Island waters, according to a March 2024 report by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM). Between 2020 and 2023, that number was less than 500,000 pounds.
“Quahogging in Narragansett Bay is a quintessential Rhode Island trade whose harvest brings us the Ocean State summer staples of clear chowder and stuffies,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “Unfortunately, quahog and other shellfish landings are in steady decline across the Eastern Seaboard, and it’s been difficult for shell fisherman and researchers to pinpoint exactly why.”
A state legislative commission spent nearly a year studying the quahog’s decline, but the 13-member panel never firmly settled on a definitive cause following eight public hearings. Their final report published in June 2024 did note that global climate change may be having an impact. More likely, the panel said, low levels of nitrogen in Narragansett Bay has decreased the nutrients quahogs feed on. 
The nitrogen decrease resulted from the state’s goal to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment facilities, leading shellfishermen on the panel to urge the state to permit additional nitrogen discharges treatment plants during the winter to fertilize more phytoplankton that feed quahogs.
The commission’s report stopped short of recommending such discharges.
Instead, the report called on lawmakers to increase funding for the state-funded Shellfish Transplant Program — which involves moving shellfish from waters that are closed off due to pollution into other areas where commercial harvesting is permitted. The practice began in 1954 and has occurred annually in Rhode Island since the late 1970s, with funding provided by fines levied on municipal wastewater treatment facilities.
This year saw a House resolution that would have allocated $2.3 million for the DEM to transplant more quahogs into Narragansett Bay and establish a shellfish hatchery program, but the proposal died in committee.
Commission members also recommended establishing a permanent quahog advisory commission or similar board composed of stakeholders — somewhat similar to the federal proposal now floated by Whitehouse.
Stephen DeLeo, a spokesperson for Whitehouse’s office, confirmed the state legislative commission served as inspiration for the bill.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Five Idaho legislators participated in a bipartisan conference for American state legislators this week that took place in and was sponsored by Israel amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle; House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, House Local Government Committee Chairwoman Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls; House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee Chairman Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa; and Rep. John Shirts, R-Weiser, participated in the trip.
Boise State Public Radio first reported Wednesday that Idaho legislators were among 250 state legislators from across the United States who visited Israel to participate in the 50 States, One Israel conference. 
Skaug, Shirts and Rubel confirmed publicly they participated in the trip. Efforts to reach Ehardt and Tanner were unsuccessful on Friday.
The Idaho state legislators’ visit occurred amid the ongoing Gaza war as Israel sent ground troops and tanks into Gaza City. This week the U.N.’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory released a report stating Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. 
On Tuesday, the Idaho Israel Alliance posted photos of Rubel, Shirts, Skaug, Ehardt and Tanner planting a tree and Idaho flag at Ofakim Park, one of the Israeli communities attacked by Hamas and other militant groups on Oct. 7, 2023.
Four of the Idaho legislators on the trip are Republicans. 
Rubel, who is Jewish and a descendant of Holocaust refugees, was the only Idaho Democrat on the trip.

 Group of Idaho Democrats call for Rubel to step down from Idaho House minority leadership

On Friday, the Idaho Young Democrats released a statement strongly disagreeing with Rubel participating in a trip financed by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A group of Idaho Democrats also circulated a letter Friday condemning Rubel for participating in the trip and calling for Rubel to step down from her leadership position and reconsider serving in public office.
Rubel told the Idaho Capital Sun she was invited by the Israeli Consulate and chose to go on the trip because she viewed it as a unique learning experience. As a Democrat in the political minority in Idaho, Rubel said she often has to meet with and work with people she disagrees with. Rubel said she viewed the Israel trip in a similar light and said the trip proved to be a valuable learning experience. 
“I didn’t think there would ever be a time when I would again have this level of exposure to decision makers, this ability to ask questions or the ability to access places I otherwise never would have,” Rubel said Friday. “It was an educational opportunity to inform myself and convey my own concerns to decision makers at a level I would probably never have an opportunity like that again.”
 Skaug and Rubel said they did not spent any Idaho taxpayer dollars on the trip

Skaug said Friday that he was invited on the trip by the Israeli Consulate out of San Francisco, which paid for all the expenses.
Skaug said he believes he was invited because he is pro-Israel and co-sponsored Senate Bill 1086, Idaho’s Anti-Boycott Against Isreal Act, in 2021. 
During the trip, Skaug said he heard from several Israeli leaders and was in close proximity to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Skaug said he also visited the old city wall of Jerusalem, where he prayed and posted photos taken with Shirts and Tanner. 
Skaug said he took the trip to build relationships, learn from people in Israel and meet other legislators from across the U.S.

“We have legislators go to Taiwan, China, Mexico and all over the world on trade missions or to build relationships,” Skaug said. “That is the same as how I see this Israel trip, to build relationships and also hopefully more trade.” 
Skaug said he and other legislators met with families who lost loved ones in the Oct. 7 attack against Israel.
As he traveled home Friday, Skaug said he left feeling hopeful for peace in the Middle East. 
Reached Friday, Shirts confirmed he participated in the trip too. Shirts is a former assistant U.S. attorney for Idaho who was appointed during President Donald Trump’s first term and serves as a prosecutor in the Air Force Reserve.
“I am a strong supporter of Israel and its fight against terrorism,” Shirts said in a written message to the Idaho Capital Sun. “I was grateful for the opportunity to see firsthand the challenges Israel and the region are facing and to strengthen relationships with a longtime ally of our country.”
Rubel also said she did not spend Idaho taxpayer dollars on the trip. She said she made it clear to organizers her visit is not an endorsement of Netanyahu’s government.  
During the trip, Rubel said she spoke up in front of Israel President Isaac Herzog during a state dinner and said the American public has grave concerns about the civilian casualties in Gaza and that the staggering loss of life is causing Israel to lose the hearts and minds of the American public.
Rubel also said she asked about famine in Gaza and sought out people with different perspectives and viewpoints. 
“I went to gain a deeper understanding of this conflict and to have direct conversations with leaders about the war in Gaza — including asking hard, necessary questions,” Rubel wrote in a message posted to social media Thursday. 
“As a Democrat in Idaho’s superminority, I often engage with people whose views are very different from mine,” Rubel added. “Listening and asking questions isn’t a sign of agreement — it’s a way to build understanding and find a path forward, even when the issues are deeply painful and divisive. The suffering in Gaza is unimaginable, as is the suffering of the families of the October 7 victims and hostages. Tens of thousands of innocent people, including children, have been killed or displaced. Families have been torn apart, and entire communities destroyed. This violence must end, and many across the world will likely have to participate to bring a lasting peace.”
“As a Jewish woman and the descendant of Holocaust refugees, I carry a personal connection to this region and its history,” Rubel wrote in Thursday’s message on social media. “My family’s story is one of survival in the face of hatred, and that history fuels my commitment to justice, even when it requires difficult conversations. For more than a decade, I’ve fought tirelessly for progressive causes here in Idaho, and have found that it is always a good idea to learn more about every issue and perspective.”

In a statement released Friday, the Idaho Young Democrats said it strongly disagreed with Rubel’s decision to participate in the trip. 
“At a time when Palestinians are facing violence and a disturbing humanitarian crisis — a genocide – her participation in this trip sends the wrong message,” Idaho Young Democrats said. “While we appreciate her explanation, in which she clearly condemned the actions of the Israeli government, we feel that given the nature of the trip, her decision to participate does not reflect the values of our community.”
The Idaho Young Democrats also spoke out against Republicans on the trip and said Rubel has a duty to distinguish between herself and her Republican colleagues. 
“Last year, the Idaho Democratic Party overwhelmingly passed a ceasefire resolution introduced by Idaho Young Democrats, affirming our party’s commitment to peace, justice, and human rights,” the Idaho Young Democrats said. “We continue to condemn the mass displacement, indiscriminate bombing, and killing of countless civilians by the Israeli government, and reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire, release of all hostages, and to fight against antisemitism, which has skyrocketed. We call for accountability and solidarity from our legislators.”
On Friday, 157 people who identified themselves as Idaho Democrats signed a letter to Rubel and issued a press release calling on Rubel to step down from her leadership position with House Democrats and apologize to Idahoans. 
As House minority leader, Rubel is the highest ranking Democrat in the Idaho House of Representatives
The letter included the signers’ first and last names, followed by their legislative district number.
In bold letters, the letter states “Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.”
“Less than 50 miles from your Israeli-funded propaganda trip, Israel has been engaged in the nonstop bombardment of Palestinians for nearly two years,” the letter states. “Israel has killed at least 64,964 people and wounded at least 165,312 Palestinians — over 10% of the population of Gaza…”
Shiva Rajbhandari, a climate activist and former Boise School District Board member, signed the letter and shared it with the Idaho Capital Sun. Rajbhandari is a registered Idaho voter affiliated with the Idaho Democratic Party, Idaho voter records show. Rajbhandari is a college student and activist studying public policy and sociology at the University of North Carolina. 
Rajbhandari said he has called on all Idaho legislators who participated in the Israel trip to resign. But the letter from Democrats is specifically addressed to Rubel as a leader of their party, Rajbhandari said. 
“The 157 signers are focused on the moral leadership of the Democratic Party and differentiating our party’s politics from the pro-genocide platform of the GOP,” Rajbhandari told the Sun on Friday morning.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — After three months in ICE detention, legal fees mounting and no release in sight, Nuri Garibo Chona did what she called unimaginable. She left behind four daughters to return to the birthplace where she hadn’t lived for decades. The Omaha mom was here illegally. Her kids are all U.S. citizens, and younger ones now are in the care of her oldest daughter, who is 27. 
Another woman ensnared in the Glenn Valley Foods immigration raid in Omaha also was removed to Mexico last week without her two children, who remained in Omaha with their dad. On her way out, Leydy Solis Factor said she still was confused about why the work permit she got through proper channels was no longer good.

Meanwhile, one of the men still held from the raid in the Lincoln County Jail has hired a local lawyer to replace an out-of-state firm and prays he hasn’t lost a shot at being released on bond. He has a wife and children in Omaha and fears for their safety if he is forced back to Guatemala.
The number of Glenn Valley workers detained in this North Platte jail, which is paid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain migrants, has dwindled since the high-profile worksite raid executed June 10 by more than 80 federal and local agents. 
Shortly after the Nebraska Examiner visited the facility last week, Garibo Chona and Solis Factor were removed from the country, and three other women were released on bond, leaving six from the Glenn Valley raid among those in custody there. 
ICE officials did not provide specifics when asked this week for an update, but of the original group of roughly 80 arrested, a spokesperson previously said about a dozen were released early and 63 were sent to North Platte. Several agreed to voluntarily deport themselves, and many have been released on bond as their lawyers build cases to prevent forced removal.
To State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, their journeys and circumstances have become even more relevant as the state prepares to repurpose a state prison into a  300-bed ICE detention center in McCook, a town of about 7,200 residents about an hour from North Platte.

Last week she became the first state lawmaker to sit down with Glenn Valley detainees. The discussion ranged from medical, legal and interpreter services to how their children were faring. After meeting with men and women garbed in black and white stripes, Juarez stepped into a nearby hall and cried. 
She said she’s on a mission to ensure that federal ICE detainees in Nebraska have access to the same services offered to state inmates in state prisons.
“It was really difficult to see the reality, the human faces,” said Juarez, whose South Omaha district includes the Glenn Valley plant and other meatpackers that traditionally have attracted immigrant workers.
 “These are people locked up away from family,” she said. “We have jailed innocent working people.”
* * * 
The federal government has a different viewpoint. 
Representatives of ICE and its Homeland Security Investigations arm have repeatedly referred to the Glenn Valley case as a targeted, federal criminal investigation aimed at stopping the widespread use of stolen identifications by foreign-born workers to gain jobs.
“These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans,” HSI’s Mark Zito has said. “If pretending to be someone you aren’t in order to steal their lives isn’t blatant criminal dishonesty, I don’t know what is.”
Court documents track the Omaha raid  — the largest immigration enforcement action in Nebraska since 2018 — back to a March subpoena that sought company employment records tying 107 of 177 employees to fraudulent IDs or documents that didn’t authorize them to work in the country.

At least one defrauded U.S. citizen already had lodged identity theft complaints with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration. During the raid, agents questioned a worker whose job application matched the name of that complainant — leading to the arrest of Guadalupe Cabrera Mejia.
To date, available federal court records show Cabrera Mejia as the only Glenn Valley employee criminally charged for the alleged use of a stolen ID. Asked how that reconciled with “widespread” criminal activity alleged earlier, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nebraska said ICE determines whether to pursue felony criminal charges. 
With regard to the Glenn Valley probe, she said, ICE elected “overwhelmingly” to pursue administrative charges in immigration court, a venue and process independent of federal prosecutors.
ICE has said an administrative charge is often a more expedient option, a faster path to deportation. The raid came as federal agencies are under pressure from the Trump administration’s goal of making 3,000 related arrests per day and pursuing mass deportations.

In Nebraska, Gov. Jim Pillen, backed by many legislative Republicans, has pledged resources to help President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda. Among state offerings: turning the McCook-based Work Ethic Camp into a Midwestern ICE detention center that federal officials dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink.” 
That conversion plan requires the relocation of 186 state inmates elsewhere in a Nebraska correctional system already ranked as the most crowded in the country, when measured by operational capacity. The decision to offer ICE state assistance sparked protests at the Governor’s Mansion and a four-hour public hearing that drew dozens of opponent speakers and no proponents.
Scant details shared about the project is partly what Juarez said spurred her to make the trek west to the jail in North Platte and prison in McCook. 
“This isn’t going away,” she said. “They’re amping up enforcement, and I really wanted to see and hear from these families for myself.”

On a day last week, Lincoln County Sheriff Jerome Kramer accompanied Juarez into separate cell blocs for men and women. The Examiner was allowed as well.
Women set aside Bibles and art materials and huddled around the silver table where the lawmaker sat. An interpreter from a local advocacy group called Hope Esperanza helped bridge any language gaps.

Kramer praised the nonprofit’s founder, North Platte native TinaMaria Fernandez, for having eased stress that came with the sudden swell of inmates whose first language was different from that of his staff. 
The arrival of the Glenn Valley group increased the jail population by about 50% at a time the facility was short-staffed, Kramer said. He said the federal government pays the county $74 a day for each ICE detainee and covers transportation and medical expenses.
“If I remember it right, they called to see if we could take them and said they’d be here in three hours,” Kramer said. 
Juarez viewed as a positive sign the rapport between Hope Esperanza, Kramer and his team and detainees. She wondered out loud if McCook has a similar community organization able to assist in that town’s future ICE detention operation.
Fernandez said that while McCook is about an hour’s drive away, she didn’t see her team being able to provide similar humanitarian outreach at that facility, since the oversight would be federal versus local county officials. 
Most of the women, in response to Juarez’s queries, said they hadn’t visited with family members face-to-face but had been able to communicate via video conferencing. 
Jail staff have been respectful and responsive, several said. Another added: “It’s ugly. We’re locked up.” 
Isabel Ponce, a 34-year-old mother of three kids who are with their father in Omaha, said anxiety was “pushing my limits.” 
For some, legal relief has been grinding or nonexistent.
In Garibo Chona’s case, for example, an immigration judge ordered her removal from the country. She was torn about appealing and leaving her daughters but said the judge told her he would not change his mind if her case came before him six months later. She was removed from the country last week.
Solis Factor said she had a government-issued permit to work while awaiting a court hearing, so she at first was not concerned she’d be detained. But many immigration programs and rules have changed since Trump took office for the second time in January. And a judge ordered her removal.
“I want my children to stay and continue their education and learning English,” she said of her kids, ages 5 and 10.

In the men’s detention quarters, Juarez asked a small group if they had a criminal background.
“We are workers,” said Juan Ramirez Jacinto of Guatemala. He said he had three children and a wife in Omaha and was especially worried about a daughter who hadn’t been able to sleep well.
Ramirez Jacinto’s first lawyer was part of a group based in another state. His new attorney, Jamie Arango of Lincoln, said she is trying to make up for time lost to ineffective counsel and will seek his release on bond. 
Even with attentive representation, Arango and other experts say an already complex immigration system on top of fast-changing federal policies understandably leaves clients puzzled.

Indeed, the swiftly-evolving immigration landscape has been playing out in an Omaha courtroom.

The three most recent cases were decided Sept. 11 and involved women who had met with Juarez. Among them was Yurenia Genchi Palma, a single mother of three U.S. citizen children who had been in the country more than 20 years. 
Though an immigration judge in mid-July granted Genchi Palma’s release on a $7,000 bond, federal attorneys blocked it by filing an “automatic stay.” Nebraska Appleseed, which represents her, called that a new practice driven by the “interim guidance” leaked in a July 8 internal memo from the Trump administration. 
The new approach seeks to make nearly all detained immigrants facing removal proceedings ineligible for release on bond, with an aim of making more of them more likely to self deport, experts say. 
ICE has said the changed direction “closes a loophole to our nation’s security” that the Biden administration and others had based on “inaccurate interpretation” of federal law. Such measures are needed, says Trump and other supporters of stepped-up immigration enforcement, to reverse past patterns.
Bataillon ruled the automatic stay provision and prolonged detention unconstitutional despite a Sept. 6 decision days before by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which had affirmed the “interim guidance.” 
As a federal court judge, Bataillon is not required to follow the decision of the BIA, an administrative body in the executive branch. He questioned the legal rationale behind the analysis but said that wasn’t his concern. 
He said his ruling was based only on the lawfulness of the automatic stay. 
Grant Friedman of ACLU Nebraska foresees continued legal challenges and noted that the ICE no-bond practice already is being challenged in a separate national class action lawsuit. He said ACLU and other advocates are on heightened alert.
“The immigration landscape is rapidly changing,” Friedman said. “We are doing everything we can to make sure people are being treated fairly, that they have their rights respected.”
Anne Wurth, associate legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, which has assisted many Glenn Valley workers, called the current landscape “absolute chaos.”
 “We have a system that is punishing individuals we rely on in our workforce and who are just humans who deserve to live their life with freedom,” she said.

Juarez said dealing with immigration-related matters was not something she expected as a state officeholder. She’s the first Latina in the Nebraska Legislature and is serving her first year as a state lawmaker.

A Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, she recently clashed over immigration policy in an email exchange with former Nebraska governor and now U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Nebraska, and plans to urge the state’s all-GOP congressional delegation to push for immigration reform. She toured the  McCook jail after leaving North Platte, and vows to monitor the conversion and amplify related budget discussions. 
“There’s no doubt I’m going to stand up,” said Juarez. “My community expects that.”
For Ramirez Jacinto, each day in detention brings worry. Is his daughter able to sleep yet? Are the house bills paid? Will his family in Omaha go with him if he’s deported? How will they escape the violence?
“I’d like my family to stay, but who would work?” said Ramirez Jacinto. “I’m the worker.”

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Complaints filed with the Arkansas Ethics Commission this week claim three Republican state officials and political action committees tied to them “appear to have repeatedly and willfully violated” state campaign finance law.
The co-founders of an online legislation tracking and analysis firm said in a press release Friday that they’d filed the complaints with the ethics panel. By law, the ethics commission cannot confirm it received the complaints.
The 29-page package provided by ArkLeg Bill Tracker co-founder Janie Ginocchio alleges that Attorney General Tim Griffin, state Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, and state Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, and PACs associated with them violated campaign contribution limits and prohibitions on illegal coordination of contributions, the use of public property for campaign purposes and public servants receiving outside payment for carrying out official duties. 
“The enclosed materials detail a pattern of conduct centered on Attorney General Tim Griffin and his PAC, Jobs and Growth (JAG PAC), which allegedly utilized a network of controlled PACs — including those operated by his campaign manager, Rep. David Ray; Sen. Ben Gilmore; and associates of the Gilmore Strategy Group — to launder contributions, evade contribution limits, and obscure the true source of campaign funds,” a letter accompanying the complaints states.

Ginocchio’s complaints also allege that Ray’s receipt of campaign funds from Griffin, while a sitting legislator who filed bills affecting the attorney general’s office, created a severe conflict of interest and the appearance of quid pro quo.”
Ray, Gilmore and Griffin all characterized the complaints as frivolous and politically motivated. 
The package of complaints include allegations that:

Griffin illegally accepted over-the-limit campaign contributions, used state resources for campaign purposes and “convert[ed] campaign funds into a personal slush fund to pay for official government operations.”
Griffin’s political action committee, Jobs and Growth PAC, violated state ethics law by using a state vehicle owned by the attorney general’s office for campaign-related purposes.
Ray improperly accepted more than $130,000 in cash from Griffin’s campaign during legislative sessions, “constituting unlawful outside compensation for his official duties as a state legislator” and that the payments coincided with Ray’s sponsorship of several bills that expanded the power of the attorney general’s office.
A network of PACs controlled by Griffin, Gilmore, Ray and Gilmore Strategy Group, owned by the senator’s brother Jon Gilmore, “worked in concert” to conceal the true source of funds to Griffin’s campaign.
Gilmore Strategy Group PAC made contributions over the campaign finance maximum of $3,300 per election to Griffin’s campaign.
Base Point PAC, the senator’s political action committee, made over-the-limit contributions to Griffin’s campaign.

In a text to the Advocate, Griffin said: “These politically-motivated complaints are a total joke and are deeply unserious to anyone who knows anything about Arkansas law. My campaign and political action committee go to great lengths to follow all applicable laws and rules, and I look forward to this frivolous complaint being dismissed.”

“It is without a doubt a frivolous attack against me and other conservative Republicans,” Ben Gilmore said in an email, “and it is without question politically motivated. As always, I will continue to follow the law and should the Ethics Commission contact me, I will work with them to prove that to be the case.”
Ray said the complaint “might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever read. It is completely false, totally frivolous, and not even worth the paper it’s printed on. These left-wing activists are attacking me because I’m an effective Republican legislator and they don’t like my politics. I am not intimidated by their baseless attacks — in fact, they only motivate me to work even harder to advance conservative policies and principles.”
Ginocchio also filed ethics complaints against Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge and Secretary of State Cole Jester for filing incomplete and inaccurate campaign finance reports.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tim-Griffin-debate-e1697496889763-1024x605.jpg,,,2025-09-20 05:56:59.835594

(timnewman/iStock via Getty Images Plus)Before the United States began vaccinating all infants at birth with the hepatitis B vaccine in 1991, about 18,000 children every year contracted the virus before their 10th birthday — about half of them at birth. About 90% of that subset developed a chronic infection.
In the U.S., one in four children chronically infected with hepatitis B will die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Today, fewer than 1,000 U.S. children or adolescents contract the virus every year — a 95% drop. Fewer than 20 babies are reported infected at birth.
I am a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist who studies vaccine delivery and policy. Vaccinating babies for hepatitis B at birth remains one of the clearest, most evidence-based ways to keep American children free of this lifelong, deadly infection.
On Sept. 18, 2025, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an independent panel of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, debated changing the recommendation. According to the proposed language of the vote, infants whose mothers test positive for hepatitis B would still receive the vaccine at birth. Infants whose mothers do not test positive for hepatitis B would get the vaccine at 1 month of age, though parents would have the choice for them to receive it earlier. On Sept. 19, however, the committee tabled the vote, delaying it to the next committee meeting, scheduled for Oct. 22-23.
Although such a proposed change sounds small, it is not based on any new evidence. It would undo more than three decades of a prevention strategy that has nearly eliminated early childhood hepatitis B in the U.S.
While the committee regularly reviews vaccine guidance, nothing is business as usual about this meeting. In June 2025, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. disbanded the entire committee and handpicked new members. The committee has long-standing procedures to evaluate the evidence supporting the risks and benefits of a given vaccine, as well as other parameters of its use. But in this case, these procedures are not being followed.
 
Why the CDC adopted universal hepatitis B shots
Hepatitis B is a virus that infects liver cells, causing inflammation and damage. In adults, it is spread through blood and bodily fluids, which can happen through unprotected sex, contaminated needles or contact with open cuts or sores of someone who is carrying it.
The hepatitis B vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Before 1991, public health guidance recommended giving newborns and young children the hepatitis B vaccine only if they were at high risk of being infected — for example, if they were born to a mother infected with hepatitis B or living in a household with someone known to have hepatitis B.
That targeted plan failed. Tens of thousands of children were still infected each year.
Some newborns were exposed when their mothers weren’t properly screened or if their mothers got infected late in pregnancy. Children also became infected through household contacts or in child care settings by exposures as ordinary as shared toothbrushes or a bite that breaks the skin. Because hepatitis B can survive for a week on household surfaces, and many carriers are unaware they are infected, even babies and toddlers of uninfected mothers remained at risk.
Recognizing these gaps, in 1991 the CDC recommended hepatitis B vaccination for every child starting at birth, regardless of maternal risk.
 
Vaccinating at birth
The greatest danger for infants contracting hepatitis B is at birth, when contact with a mother’s blood can transmit the virus. Without preventive treatment or vaccination, 70% to 90% of infants born to infected mothers will become infected themselves, and 90% of those infections will become chronic. The infection in these children silently damages their liver, potentially leading to liver cancer and death.
About 80% of parents choose to follow the CDC’s guidance and vaccinate their babies at birth. If the CDC’s recommendations change to delaying the first dose to 1 month old, it would leave babies unprotected during this most vulnerable window, when infection is most likely to lead to chronic infection and silently damage the liver.
The hepatitis B vaccines used in the U.S. have an outstanding safety record. The only confirmed risk is an allergic reaction called anaphylaxis that occurs in roughly 1 in 600,000 doses, and no child has died from such a reaction. Extensive studies show no link to other serious conditions.
The current recommendations are designed to protect every child, including those who slip through gaps in maternal screening or encounter the virus in everyday life. A reversion to the ineffective risk-based approach threatens to erode this critical safety net.

Tamara Taylor has played softball, volleyball and basketball, but tackle football hits different — literally.

This report was originally published by The 19th.

“I just like to hit people and have fun,” said Taylor, 31, defensive lineman for Denver’s Mile High Blaze women’s tackle football team. “When I moved to Denver, that’s when I found out about football in general. … I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
Taylor and players like her are punting football’s traditional gender norms — tackle is for boys and men, flag is for girls and women — with a growing fan base across the country. And the sports world is taking notice: The Women’s Football Alliance (WFA) — home to the Blaze — became the first women’s tackle football league to secure a multiyear network deal with ESPN2, and the league’s national championship has been broadcast on the sports network for the last three years.
This year’s national championship brought in 969,000 total live viewers, making it the most-watched game on ESPN2 that day. The WFA’s St. Louis Slam took home the win against the DC Divas with a final score of 26-14.
The WFA has also announced expansion into Canada this year. The women’s tackle league has partnered with Cosmos Sports & Entertainment, a sports marketing firm based in Ontario, to identify cities in Canada that could host a team.

Lisa King, a former semi-professional soccer player, founded the WFA in 2009. The alliance is the oldest and largest women’s tackle football league in the world. With 60 teams across three divisions, the league has 12 professional teams.
King was interested in playing football throughout her childhood, but her parents denied her opportunity. After graduating from college, she jumped at the chance to play for a women’s tackle football team in Los Angeles. In founding the league, she wanted to use a similar structure as the soccer teams she had excelled in and bring it to women’s tackle football.
Ten years later, in 2019, Odessa Jenkins, a former player for the WFA, expanded opportunities by creating the Women’s National Football Conference (WNFC). Made up of 17 teams, the WNFC may be smaller in size, but has made an impact on the future of women in football by having a robust branding infrastructure in place to amplify the sport, including creative direction. Jenkins, who played and coached for the WFA’s Dallas Elite, aims to expand opportunities for women football players so that they get the level of recognition they deserve.
For the WNFC, this year marks the first time they have broadcast their national championship game on ESPN2. The matchup between the Texas Elite Spartans and Washington Prodigy came with a new high in digital engagement. The broadcast gained 150,000 championship viewers and more than 150,000 followers on Instagram, a 61% increase since 2024. The league’s TikTok account also doubled since last year, with over 46,000 followers.
And ideally, that recognition will come with pay for players — in the WNFC and the WFA. While neither league provides a salary for players, the WNFC does offer prize money to championship teams. With help from sponsorships by brands like Adidas, Dove and Riddell, the WNFC provided players on the championship team with $20,000. The WFA did not provide a monetary prize for the championship, but was able to cover some costs for players.
“It’s truly a pay-to-play type of situation because we’re not paying these wonderful athletes,” said Rob Sandlin, head coach of the Mile High Blaze, who noted that the financial strain and dedication required can be the biggest challenges for players new to the sport. “We try to be as brutally honest as possible when it comes to what to expect. The one thing that most rookies don’t quite understand is the level of dedication that’s required.”
Players must pay dues to remain part of the team, but payment doesn’t guarantee they’ll see time on the field.
“The physical aspects we can explain. The mental parts of the competition can be explained. The idea of how much work you have to put into it is probably the one thing that I get back from people that decide, ‘Yeah, I can’t do this,’ more than anything,” he said.
According to sports news site Marca, the average NFL salary in 2024 was about $3.2 million. While women don’t play for NFL teams, there has been growth in opportunities for women to be on staff. The NFL now has the most full-time women coaches of any professional men’s sports league, with 15 women holding coaching positions across departments.
While girls have access to flag football, a low-contact variant of tackle football, the sport traditionally separates based on gender as young athletes get older. Youth flag football has co-ed opportunities for players ranging from 5 to 17 years old. Tackle football more commonly has restrictions on girls and women playing, both during adolescence and adulthood.
Women’s flag football is seeing growth of its own, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics announcing that they will have women’s flag football teams competing for the first time. The NFL has also received bids for future investments in women’s professional flag football leagues this year.
Challenges aside, being in a high-contact sport as a woman has proven to be a unique and rewarding experience for these football players, whether they started playing as children with their siblings or discovered tackle as adults.
For Yolanda “YoYo” Searcy, football was etched in her life at a young age. Breaking with tradition, her Florida high school offered her a spot on the all-boys football team.
“The head coach coached all my siblings and was like, ‘I know what you can do,’” she said.
She declined and joined a school-sanctioned flag football team instead. Years later, she got her chance to play with other tackle-loving women as a linebacker with the Mile High Blaze.
Rosa Climaco, who has been an offensive lineman for the WNFC’s Washington Prodigy for three years, feels she could have benefited from finding football earlier. As someone interested in incorporating fitness into her lifestyle, Climaco finds football to be the perfect choice.
“One night scrolling on Instagram at 3 a.m., I found [WFA player] Lois Cook’s Instagram and just started going down the rabbit hole. I’m like, ‘Whoa, there is a legitimate football league that exists for women,’ and really the only regret I have is that I found it when I was 31,” she said.
Some players find that they have to balance the societal expectation for women to curb aggression with the demand for them to play rough to win.
“I personally think there’s caution tape around aggression even still in women’s football,” said Kourtney “KP” Purham, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy. “The idea for men obviously is to be aggressive at its most violent level. One of the things our coach says this year is ‘I support organized violence,’ but it’s like him selling that to us because women are taught not to be that way.”
“So, you’re now trying to navigate through what violence looks like in a sport that was designed for men to be violent and still how to be a lady in a violent sport,” Purham said.

Tapping into aggression comes more naturally to some of these athletes than others. While some players found tackle football to be a place where they could release that side of their personalities, others have had to embrace their aggressive side for the first time.
“A lot of the time for me, it was always, ‘You’re too loud, you’re too rough, you’re too this, you’re too that,’” said Washington Prodigy linebacker and captain Ramzeh Deen-sie.“I was still seeking a way to get out my aggression and just be who I am in my true, natural self.”
Deen-sie describes her transition from playing offense to playing defense as a perfect fit for her personality.
“It was just like, ‘OK, you want me to tackle whoever got the ball. You want me to put my shoulder pads through their chest and make sure they cannot come get you the next play,’” she said. “‘I can do that cause I’m already aggressive, I like to fight, I’m always on 10. I can do this.’”
Tonique’a Jackson, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy, has a much different relationship with aggression. For her, focusing on protecting her teammates has allowed her to move with more force on the field.
“I think trying to find that aggressive part of me, it took a really really long time. If it wasn’t being knocked over, if it wasn’t being tripped up, if it wasn’t being yelled at, it’s like you have to tap into the dog inside of you ’cause it’s either beat or be beaten, and that’s where my aggression comes from,” she said.
Outside of pushing her to explore her self-expression, playing football has also allowed Jackson to carry on a family legacy.
“In 2021, I lost my son to gun violence. He was very big in football, and [it was] something that was really, really important to him,” she said. “I wanted to find a way to not only stay connected to him but to also keep his dream alive because I felt like it was taken from him at such a short time in his life.”
Players say they’re satisfied with the growing recognition for their sport — and their representation in it.
“Just to see now with the progression of us being kind of everywhere, involved in coaching at the high school level, too, we’re getting a lot more fans out,” said Mile High Blaze quarterback Kimberly Santistevan. “Whether they know us directly or they’ve heard of us and they want to see us and check us out … the stands are getting fuller and fuller every year.”

The new film, “In the Wake of Justice Delayed,” follows five years in the families’ search for justice – in two cases of murder of Native women, one more recent murder in Palmer in 2019 and one decades ago in Point Hope in 1985 – and a diving into the interconnected grief and impacts of violence in the ongoing crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people, particularly women, in Alaska.
The film is set to premiere in Alaska with screenings in Anchorage on Sept. 21, and Homer on Sept. 27. It will air nationwide on PBS on Nov. 1. 
The documentary opens with the statement: “Native women and girls experience a murder rate 10 times higher than the national average,” by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Women are not just statistics. They are not just numbers,” said Alice Quannik Glenn, a journalist and podcast host from Utgiagvik featured in the film. “They’re real people that influence the other people around them. They influence their communities. So when one of us isn’t safe, it makes us all vulnerable.”
For the Miller family of Teller, pop 249, located about 70 miles outside of Nome, the once tight-knit family was devastated by the murder of their daughter, twin-sister, and mother Mingnuna Bobbi Jean Miller in Palmer in 2019. 
The film follows her twin sister Billi Jean Miller navigating the loss of her twin, as well as their mother, going through the pain of the subsequent five-year trial of her then-boyfriend charged with murder.   
“If I could push one thing, it’d be to know how to advocate for your family,” Miller says in the film. “When she died, I didn’t know how to advocate for her. I would have talked more to the police department or investigator.”
In a phone interview, Miller said sharing Bobbi’s story brings a mix of emotions, but she hopes it will inspire change in how domestic violence incidents – and Native women – are seen and addressed by law enforcement. 
“That shouldn’t have been her story,” she said. 
Miller said her twin sought help from the Palmer Police Department days before her death. “She wanted to come home and you know, they stigmatized her as just a Native woman on drugs, but she wasn’t on drugs. And that’s just the sad reality is that we’re treated differently,” she said. “They should have done their due diligence of helping her, if that’s their profession.”
For the Lane family of Point Hope, population 830, the grown children of Harriet Lane share their grief and outstanding questions of what happened to their mother. 
“I would like to see my mother rest in peace,” her son, Amos Lane said in the film. “Thirty years later, there are still unanswered questions that need to be addressed.”
In 1985, Harriet Lane was tortured, raped and murdered by three men in their community of Point Hope. 
“I don’t know what really happened. But that’s what people say happened,” Amos Lane said, and that it was never properly investigated. “So, that’s brutal.”
The family is continuing to grapple with the pain of her death, and calling for the case to be re-opened and investigated. “To this day, no one’s been charged with a murder,” he said. “Something is wrong.”
“No one should have to deal with this … without any resolution, without any closure, without any justice.” 
The film is the six year project of filmmaker and director Mary Katze and Affinity Films, a non-profit educational media production company based in Anchorage. 
“The story is about what it does to the psychological condition of people who are not acknowledged or believed or see any justice whatsoever,” Katze said in a phone interview. 
The film overlays the personal tragedies in the wider historical background of Alaska’s history of colonization, exploitation of natural resources and violence against Alaska Native communities, including slavery. During Russian colonization of Alaska beginning in the 18th century, the fur traders enslaved Ungangan peoples of the Aleutian Islands to force them to hunt for seals for the lucrative fur trade. The legacy of that violent period has been felt for generations, Tara Bourdukosky of St. Paul Island explains in the film, and continues to be felt today. 
“It is important to want to know, to talk about these things, to find out what actually happened in our past and how we got to be where we are today,” she said.
Katze said it was important to depict the generational trauma and legacies of violence felt by Alaska Native communities today. 
“I’ve been here 40 years, but I’ve never connected how that introduction to our (Western) culture, to our world, was so negative and traumatizing for so many people. And it’s important to understand that that’s the root base of families for generations. So there’s a distrust, and rightfully so, that they’re going to be treated right by this law enforcement. They have their own ways of dealing with murder in in their villages, and that was crushed when they brought in official law enforcement people,” she said. “So understanding that is a foundation to people and culture that has been violated so many times for so long is a big part of understanding the crime rate.”
Miller said she also hopes the film raises awareness about how domestic violence is addressed. “Victims of domestic violence are real people, and the system fails a lot of DV survivors and people that are lost to DV,” she said. “I just hope that there’s a really big impact, and that it brings on a really great change … because it is a crisis.”
Miller said going through the almost six year court process changed her, and sharing her experience in the film was emotional and difficult, but ultimately the family welcomed the verdict and feel they received justice.
“Because a part of me wants to push those feelings under the rug, and then a part of me is just really, really, extremely grateful that Bobbi is important… that she was a real human and that she was so loved,” she said. “I think we’re very fortunate that Bobbi’s story was told, and I think Bobbi’s very fortunate to have received justice for her story. And the process was hard because it was five, almost six years long.”
She said she wants the film to shed light on the Alaska Native families and communities now enduring the search for justice for murdered loved ones.
Currently the number of victims and unsolved cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people in Alaska is unknown. The non-profit Data for Indigenous Justice is putting together its own database of cases, and filed a public records request with the Alaska Department of Public Safety for the list of names of victims and cases investigated, and the state denied their request. 
“I just hope that the audience takes away that these are people that are very much loved, and they deserve better,” Miller said. 
Katze said she also hopes to see changes in the court system, and speedier trials.
“The target audience for this film is future jury members, lawyers, judges, and law enforcement…and then how important it is to support people that are brave enough to come forward,” she said. “And so I hope that Alaskans understand more of their own history, that they understand more on missing and murdered Alaska Native women.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IN-THE-WAKE-OF-JUSTICE-DELAYED-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-09-19 23:57:11.055753

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/ct-unions-pension-connecticut-sun/,"CT's largest state employee union urged Gov. Ned Lamont to focus on overdue wage agreements for public-sector workers, not basketball.","Connecticut’s largest state employee union urged Gov. Ned Lamont late Friday to abandon talks of investing pension assets in the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun and focus on negotiating overdue wage agreements for public-sector workers.
“These members have put their hard-earned money into the pension fund, expecting a secure retirement, not for it to be used on a sports franchise that plays 18 games a year in Connecticut,” Council 4 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in a statement posted to its Facebook page. “We urge the governor to leave the distractions behind and focus on preserving public services and respecting the state employees who provide them every day.”
Lamont earlier this month endorsed the concept of investing pension assets to help keep the team in Connecticut, either at the Mohegan Sun casino, where it currently plays its home games, or at the recently renamed PeoplesBank Arena in downtown Hartford, formerly known as the XL Center.
The Associated Press reported in early August that a group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca reached a deal to buy the Sun from the Mohegan tribe for $325 million and move the team to Boston for the 2027 season.
Though the governor hasn’t said what amount Connecticut might invest to keep the team here, he did say he believes it could be a sound investment.
But Council 4, which represents more than one-quarter of state government’s unionized workforce — more than 12,000 workers across all agencies and departments — disagrees.
State employees “deserve the certainty of a dignified retirement, not the uncertainty of high-stakes investments in political pet projects,” the Facebook post continued. “Their pension contributions are the foundation of a secure retirement that workers have already earned. To use that money on a sports franchise is to gamble with the futures of those who have already sacrificed so much.”
State employee unions granted wage and benefit concessions twice in the decade of the 2010s to help close major budget deficits.
The Lamont administration did not respond to the Council 4 statement immediately after it posted Friday evening.
The Democratic governor’s efforts to retain the Connecticut Sun also has drawn fire from Republican legislative leaders, who this week called the potential investment risky and renewed a proposal for a professional board to oversee future use of pension funds.
Lamont has confirmed some discussions with tribal leaders regarding the Connecticut Sun but discussed few details publicly. The governor has said any infusion of state dollars into the sports franchise likely would be in conjunction with a private investor also interested in keeping the Sun here.
But the union wrote that Lamont has a more pressing, overdue issue to resolve.
Thirty-five bargaining units, representing nearly all unionized workers in state government excluding state police troopers, are working under wage agreements that expired June 30.
The Lamont administration, which has been trying to convince unions to scale back remote work policies established shortly after the coronavirus first struck Connecticut, hasn’t reached any tentative deals on raises yet.
And three units representing judicial staff and a fourth representing correction officers declared contract talks with the administration to be at an impasse earlier this summer. Three of the unions declaring impasse charged the Executive Branch hadn’t offered any raises to date, despite public statements from the governor that he intended to offer wage hikes to all unions.
“We urge the governor to leave the distractions behind and focus on preserving public services and respecting the state employees who provide them every day,” Council 4 added in its post.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/correctionpresser-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 22:56:52.838010

(Photo by Amanda Young/Toolik Field Station)After nearly four decades of connecting Arctic scientists to funding opportunities, research and education projects and each other, the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States held its last community meeting on Friday before a planned Sept. 30 shutdown.
The consortium, founded in 1988, is closing down after losing the National Science Foundation funding that was its major source of revenue.
Audrey Taylor, the organization’s executive director, used the online meeting to explain the ARCUS board’s shutdown recommendation, made this summer.
“The ARCUS that we know and love, what has been ARCUS for the last 35 years, doesn’t have a viable path forward at this time. And so that’s what we’re choosing to sunset,” Taylor said during the online meeting.
The consortium had been coping with reduced funding for the past few years and had already taken cost-cutting steps, like slashing its staff and moving to an entirely online workspace, she said.
The final blow was the Trump administration’s decision to end the National Science Foundation program that had provided most of the consortium’s funding, she said.
Rather than try to keep operating, the board determined that the best option was to close down in an orderly fashion that allows information to be properly archived and, wherever possible, services to be transferred to other management, Taylor said.
“Even though I think I speak on behalf of all of the board and staff that were heartbroken to take this step, we think it’s the most responsible path forward,” she said.
Wendy Warnick, who served as the executive director from 1992 to 2009, said the Trump policies have been particularly devastating.
“We’ve gone through difficult times in the past, but I think what’s happening now is unprecedented,” she said during the meeting. “I hope there’s a way to continue the work that ARCUS has done and to keep this amazing community moving forward as much as possible.”
The consortium had served as a hub for scientists from universities, private entities and public agencies in Alaska, the Lower 48 and internationally. It provided grants and financial support for research projects, supported early career scientists, supported an Indigenous Scholars Program, archived Arctic data and reports and provided other services.
Scientists who participated in ARCUS programs used Friday’s meeting to express gratitude for the past decades’ services.
Larry Hinzman, a former vice chancellor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who now serves as that university’s designated Arctic professor, said the consortium had made Arctic science more relevant and responsive to people who live in the region.
“In the early days, anything we did in Arctic research had to be justified from the importance of why the Arctic was important to the Lower 48. And I think ARCUS really helped us change that perception and made the Arctic important in its own right,” said Hinzman, who served as a science adviser to former President Joe Biden.
Helen Wiggins, who served as executive director from 2019 to 2024 and is now a board member, was a bit tearful as she lauded what she said was the “high standard of excellence” and “amazing level of professionalism” in the organization.
“It’s really about the people, it’s about the focus that I think we’ve had on authentic connections to each other, working together, supporting each other, caring about each other as people,” she said.
Some ARCUS functions will continue outside of the consortium structure.
The Sea Ice Prediction Network, a scientific collaboration that had been established by ARCUS in 2014, will continue operating as its own entity, said Brit Myers, the consortium’s strategic engagement director.
The network, which provides detailed information about ice conditions off Alaska and elsewhere in the Arctic, is supported by the Colorado-based National Snow and Ice Data Center.
The Sea Ice for Walrus Outlook, another scientific collaboration created by ARCUS, is also surviving. That network, which serves Alaska Native subsistence hunters and coastal communities, provides information on spring ice conditions in walrus habitat off Alaska. It is now operated by the Alaska Ocean Observing System, which also monitors harmful algal blooms, salmon habitat conditions and other aspects of Alaska’s marine system.
Both the NSIDC and AOOS are vulnerable to negative impacts from Trump administration policies, however.
The administration earlier this year ended a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data service that the NSIDC was using to track sea ice. The center now uses satellite-derived data from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA.
The administration has also proposed eliminating all funding for the U.S Integrated Ocean Observing System, of which AOOS is a part. That proposal is within the administration’s budget for NOAA, an agency that has already sustained deep cuts that reduced fisheries research, weather monitoring and other services.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NovemberSampling.jpg,,,2025-09-19 22:56:52.838010

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)This year’s Permanent Fund dividend will be $1,000, an amount set by the Alaska Legislature in House Bill 53, the state’s annual operating budget bill, earlier this year.
Ordinarily, lawmakers allocate an amount of money for the dividend, which makes individual payments dependent upon the number of recipients. 
The Alaska Department of Revenue then announces the final amount in September.
This year, lawmakers set a specific dividend amount, which turned the Alaska Department of Revenue’s fall announcement, released Friday, into an anticlimax.
Alaskans whose PFD applications were filed electronically, whose applications were approved as of Sept. 18, and who requested direct deposit, will begin to receive their payments Oct. 2. 
Those whose applications are approved by Oct. 13 will receive their dividends starting Oct. 23.
That includes people who applied for the dividend on paper forms or requested paper checks.
Paying a $1,000 dividend to all recipients was expected to cost $685.3 million, making it one of the largest single expenses in Alaska’s annual state budget.
Only the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development ($1.4 billion) and the Alaska Department of Health ($1.1 billion) are more expensive.
The 2026 dividend is expected to be larger, if lawmakers agree to spend from the state’s Constitutional Budget Reserve. 
Since 2020, lawmakers have approved larger dividends in election years than in non-election years.
The Alaska Permanent Fund, an $83 billion state trust fund, is the largest source of general-purpose revenue for state services, paying for between 50-60% of state operations in an ordinary year. Oil revenue, by comparison, supplies only about a third of state revenue. 
Since 1982, a portion of the fund has been paid out to Alaskans in an annual dividend. The payment was set by formula until 2016, when lawmakers — facing severe budget shortfalls — began setting it by fiat. The formula remains in state law, but legislators are not obliged to follow it.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s three members of Congress differed on a series of votes Friday intended to keep the federal government funded past the end of the month, and avert a government shutdown.
Alaska’s sole U.S. House Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, voted in favor of a seven-week budget extension, but that measure died in the U.S. Senate when lawmakers were unable to garner the 60 votes needed to pass the U.S. House measure or an alternative proposed by Democratic members of the Senate.
U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was absent from both votes. U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted against both proposals.
“I voted against both measures as I felt that they were not serious (enough) to meet the situation that we are currently in today,” she said in a recording provided by her office.
The Republican-controlled House passed its stopgap funding bill 217-212, with one Democrat voting for it and two Republicans voting against it.
“The House did its job,” Begich said in a written statement afterward. “We passed a responsible, short-term continuing resolution to keep the government open and give Congress time to complete the appropriations process. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats chose obstruction over solutions, blocking this clean measure.”
Murkowski and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, voted against the House-passed plan, while Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pennsylvania, voted for it. Eight senators did not vote, and the measure died 44-48.
The Democratic counterproposal failed 47-45.
Murkowski said that counterproposal included “a Christmas list” of Democratic ideas, including items that would have reversed big parts of the Republican “Big Beautiful Bill Act” from earlier this year, which contained core tax cuts and spending policies of Trump’s second presidential term. Murkowski and Sullivan voted for that bill, which was later signed into law.
On the other side of the coin, Murkowski said the Republican plan failed to include an extension of subsidies for health care plans passed through the federal insurance marketplace, something that is critical for Alaskans. It also didn’t include additional funding for public broadcasting or opposition to President Donald Trump’s unilateral budget clawbacks, known as recissions.
“I’m going to be busy in the next 10 days, trying to build a level of consensus that keeps the government open, because there is no side — no Republican, no Democrat, the White House — nobody wins when there is a government shutdown,” she said.
“It’s possible that my proposal will equally annoy both sides, but maybe, just maybe, it will get the conversation going in a way that advances serious discussion and positive outcomes,” Murkowski said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC03285-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 21:56:42.963335

(Photo by Andrii Koval/Getty Images)Maryland’s promise is simple: We leave no one behind. But that promise is easier said than done. It must apply when families gather in houses of worship, when students walk into classrooms, when neighbors gather in community centers — and it must include Jewish Marylanders in our daily lives. Too often, today, it does not.
Sadly, prejudice still exists, and we must fight all forms of bigotry. Maryland’s 250,000 Jews (including myself) are living through a renewed and unnerving time of fear.
Every time Jews gather — for prayer, a holiday meal, or community service — security is on our minds. Congregations hire guards, install surveillance equipment and conduct drills. These steps are necessary, but costly, exhausting and heartbreaking. Worship should not come with a price tag or the constant fear of being targeted simply for being Jewish.
This anxiety is real. Not long ago, my dear friend Sara Milgrim and her boyfriend were murdered as they left the Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. Their deaths were part of a broader trend of rising antisemitism worldwide.
The numbers confirm what we feel. Jews make up only 2% of America’s population, yet according to the FBI Hate Crime Statistics, we are the targets of roughly 70% of all religion-based hate crimes. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reports antisemitic incidents surged from 942 in 2015 to 9,354 in 2024 — an 893% increase in less than a decade.

In Maryland, we ranked fifth per capita for antisemitic incidents last year, with 356 reported — up 227% from 2022. The 2023 State of Maryland Hate Bias Report found religious-based incidents tripled from 2022 to 2023, with Jews making up 28% of all victims even though we are only 4% of the state’s population.
Antisemitism can arrive as physical attacks, but often it starts smaller — online, where allies stay silent. Recently, after I politely called out an antisemitic statement online, someone in Maryland wrote: “Well, people are getting disgusted by the horrific war crimes in Gaza perpetrated on tens of thousands of Palestinians by your notorious leader Netanyahu …”
While some may not realize it, this is deeply antisemitic. I am Jewish, but I am not Israeli. Netanyahu is not my leader. I, like most American Jews (and many Israelis), want hostages freed, the humanitarian situation in Gaza resolved and the war ended.
Should people around the world hate all Americans for Trump’s actions or all Russians for Putin’s? Of course not. Yet Jews are repeatedly scapegoated. Criticism of a government is legitimate; blaming all Jews for it is antisemitism
What happened on Oct. 7, 2023, is another reminder of why vigilance matters. That day’s Hamas terror attack in Israel was the largest mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust. Even today, hostages remain in Gaza. For Jews everywhere, October 7 is now a day of grief and remembrance.
What can Maryland do? First, continue and strengthen security grants so faith and community institutions can keep people safe. Second, strengthen prosecution of hate crimes, ensuring bias-driven violence and harassment face serious consequences. Third, invest in public education campaigns that teach students and communities to recognize and reject antisemitism and other prejudice.
Marylanders who are not Jewish can act, too. Allyship starts with listening, speaking out against antisemitism and other prejudice, and refusing to let stereotypes or silence take root.
When my father was a child in Austria, he witnessed Hitler parade through Vienna. More than 100,000 cheered. Soon, most of our family was killed for being Jewish. We are blessed my father and his parents escaped to America. But we must ensure antisemitism does not come roaring back.
Albert Einstein said, “The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch and do nothing.” One simple start: Recognize Jewish holidays — Rosh Hashanah (Sept. 22–24, 2025), Yom Kippur (Oct. 1–2), Sukkot (Oct. 6–13), October 7 (Day of Remembrance), Shemini Atzeret & Simchat Torah (Oct. 13–15) and Hanukkah (Dec. 14–22) — and avoid scheduling major civic events on those dates. Another is to speak up against hate whenever you see it.
Simple allyship across all marginalized groups sends a powerful message: Maryland leaves no one behind.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/antisemitism-700x445-1.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 20:57:41.192510

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Nearly 300,000 Marylanders who bought health insurance on the state’s Affordable Care Act Marketplace will see monthly health care costs jump next year, as state officials finalize premium rate increases for 2026.
The Maryland Insurance Administration announced the approval Friday of a 13.4% average premium rate increase for 2026, meaning individuals and households will have to pay hundreds more in health costs over next year.
While the approved rates are slightly better than what insurance companies initially asked for earlier this year, it’s still going to be a significant hike in health care costs for families already struggling to pay their bills.
“It’s going to hit patients hard,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, noting that families are already struggling with other expenses. “That’s a significant increase for those who are not getting raises to keep up.”
The Maryland Insurance Administration said that the premium increases will be needed to offset the likely end of federal tax credits that help keep costs down for low- to middle-income Marylanders.
Health advocates, state officials brace for ‘sticker shock’ if ACA tax credits expire

Those tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year and health care advocates fear that people will drop their health care coverage because they can no longer afford their plans.
Matthew Celentano, executive director of the League of Life & Health Insurers of Maryland, agrees that the increase in premiums will reduce enrollment, which impacts costs for all policyholders, not just those covered through the Affordable Care Act.
“Frankly, it’s the healthier people that leave the market. The sick are more expensive, and to cover that cost we have to see higher premiums,” Celentano said.
The insurance administration added that rising medical and pharmaceutical costs also contributed to the higher premium rates.
For this year, insurance companies initially asked for a 17.1% premium increase, but after negotiations with the insurance administration, they landed on an average 13.4% increase for the 294,189 people who have individual ACA health care plans.
Still, that’s more than twice the rate of increase from last year, when individual ACA plan premiums rose an average of 6.2%. The lowest premium rate increase in recent history was in 2022, with just a 2.1% average increase across marketplace plans.
How much more plans will cost for Marylanders will vary based on a person’s insurance carrier, location and household income and size.
For a 40-year-old living in Baltimore with a silver plan, that person could see a monthly increase anywhere from $17 to $75, depending on their carrier, according to state estimates. A family of four in the same situation could see an increase of $57 to $258, on top of their current premiums.
The General Assembly approved funding this year that would partially replace the soon-to-expire federal tax credits for the upcoming year, but those state subsidies are temporary fixes and plenty of people will still pay more each month for health care than they did this year, analysts say.
“With the pending expiration of the enhanced federal tax credits and with the state subsidy only able to partially replace the reduction, consumers may see sizable rate increases, much higher than in recent years,” Insurance Commissioner Marie Grant said in a written statement.
State officials, insurance companies and health advocates are urging Congress to extend premium tax credits, instead of letting them expire in December, though that window is closing.
“This can still be fixed,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All coalition. “We really hope that they will do something … if Congress fails, it will hurt Marylanders.”

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland lost another 2,500 federal jobs in August, the second month in a row that the state has led the nation in federal job losses, according to numbers released Friday by the Maryland Department of Labor.
The August numbers brought the  total number of federal jobs lost in the state to 15,100 since January, when President Donald Trump took office and began his campaign to slash the size of the federal workforce. That year-to-date total is also the most in the U.S., the state said.
Maryland’s economy is heavily dependent on the federal workforce: An estimated 269,000 Maryland residents were employed by the federal government in 2023, according to a report by the state’s Labor Department, and there were 158,475 federal jobs located in the state that year.
The August job numbers count jobs located in the state, which means Maryland has lost almost 10% of its federal jobs since the start of the year.
Jake Pannell, a national business representative for the National Federation of Federal Employees, said many former workers have had to leave the region, and he worries about the lack of private-sector jobs for the variety of skillsets federal workers have.
“Many of these people have decades of experience. They’re overqualified for other positions,” Pannell said, adding that some federal workers will either have to accept “huge” pay cuts or undergo job re-entry programs — training them for jobs “they’re already greatly experienced at.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
And the federal job losses are only expected to continue when the September numbers come out. As part of the push to slash the federal workforce, federal employees were offered a deferred resignation option on Jan. 28 that would allow them to receive pay and benefits until Sept. 30.
“Workforce-wide” declines are expected to show up in the job losses at the end of September and through the end of the year as those jobs come off the books, according to a statement from the Office of Personnel Management.
Lawmakers this year created an emergency short-term loan program for laid-off federal workers, and the Labor Department has set up a page for former feds looking for work that includes a list of job recruiting events and career workshops.
“The states are doing everything they have the resources to do,” Pannell said. Many resources put forward by the state, such as unemployment insurance, are federally funded and are at risk of being cut, he added.
“Those resources aren’t going to be any better than they were before,” Pannell said.
The federal job cuts were the driving factor behind an overall loss of 3,200 jobs in Maryland for the month, which drove the state’s unemployment rate from 3.4% in July to 3.6% in August. Still, Maryland’s unemployment rate remained below the national average of 4.3% for the month.
The federal job cuts began on Trump’s first day back in office, when OPM issued a memo directing agencies to identify workers who were still in their probationary period, when it is easier for them to be fired. They continued in February, when Trump ordered reductions in force and agency reorganizations in line with recommendations of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE Service.
Since taking office, Trump has also unilaterally ended collective bargaining agreements with some federal labor unions and instituted a hiring freeze that has been extended through mid-October, among other actions. All told, about 97,000 federal jobs have been lost nationwide since January 2025, according to a Sept. 5 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“If you get rid of all these federal employees within the state of Maryland or in the D.C. metro area, where are they going to go? What are they going to do?

The City of Billings owns and operates the incinerator, which is in the same building as the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter, a private nonprofit that leases space. The shelter is not operated by the City of Billings, but it does have contracts with the city.
The Billings Police Department has long used the incinerator for burning drugs, according to a Sept. 11 statement by the department.
In an emailed comment Friday, FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker said the agency “routinely uses outside facilities to conduct controlled drug evidence burns” and referred further questions to Billings city officials.
The City of Billings posted a statement on the police department’s Facebook page Thursday afternoon, saying they “regret the incident.” They called the burn an “authorized destruction of illegal drugs” in the statement.
A malfunction — a “negative pressure” issue, according to Billings police — forced meth smoke into the animal shelter on Sept. 10. It was not the first time smoke going into the animal shelter had been an issue, according to a statement from Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter Executive Director Triniti Halverson last week.
The DEQ’s authority in this matter is air quality concerns and the incineration equipment, agency spokesperson Jake Garcin wrote in an email on Thursday.
The permit for the incinerator was given on March 10, 2010, to Billings Animal Control from the DEQ. Prior to that date, the permit was held by the City of Billings Animal Shelter, the permit says.
The incinerator was initially built in 2003 and was permitted by the DEQ then. The permit stipulates that animal remains can be burned and what needs to be done if materials other than animal remains are being burned.
“The Billings Animal Control shall not incinerate/cremate any material other than animal remains and/or any corresponding container unless otherwise approved by the Department,” the permit reads. “Billings Animal Control shall provide written notice to the Department and obtain approval from the Department if material other than what would normally be termed animal remains, or its container, is to be incinerated.”
The DEQ was not informed of any specific burning activities, Garcin said. Since the original permit was issued, management of the incinerator has been done at the county level, with RiverStone Health approved to oversee compliance and submitting annual reports to the state, he added. 
According to a statement from RiverStone Health, doing business as the Yellowstone City-County Health Department, drugs previously incinerated at the facility had been pills and marijuana. RiverStone Health tracks what is being burned at that facility.
“Per our records, Health Department staff never witnessed or explicitly approved of the destruction of methamphetamine,” RiverStone CEO and Yellowstone City-County Health Officer Jonathan Forte wrote in a statement.
In addition to the Sept. 18 City of Billings press release, an emailed letter from RiverStone Health to the city’s animal control office said  an “alternate burn” was approved on Aug. 12, 2025.
“This letter serves as RiverStone Health’s approval for the City of Billings Animal Control Division to burn the materials summarized in the notification letter,” the email reads.
A second Aug. 12 letter posted on Facebook, from Animal Control to RiverStone, said the city had been contacted by the FBI for usage of the incinerator “for disposal of illegal drugs.”
Forte wrote RiverStone Health had “no knowledge” that methamphetamine was going to be burned on Sept. 10. Halverson, the animal shelter’s director, also said she had not been informed they were going to be burning methamphetamine in her statement. 
RiverStone Health, in a statement signed by Forte late Wednesday that it is “actively cooperating” with the DEQ and City of Billings. 
In an email accompanying Forte’s statement, RiverStone spokesperson Casey Page wrote, “Because this is an ongoing investigation, we are not available for further comment at this time.”
In a phone call, Page said the DEQ wants to let the investigation play out before commenting further on questions about what was being burned. The DEQ has only just begun its probe.
“Should DEQ determine that there was a violation, a letter would be issued to the City of Billings Animal Control and they would be allowed an opportunity to respond to that letter,” Garcin wrote. “After assessing all the information, including a response from the City of Billings Animal Control, DEQ would determine its intended path forward on the issue.”
The DEQ said it is also looking into whatever agreement allowed the FBI to burn meth feet from an animal shelter. 
“RiverStone Health is approved by DEQ to perform inspections and compliance oversight of minor sources that hold Montana Air Quality Permits in Yellowstone County, including cremation facilities,” Garcin wrote. “As part of its review of the incident, DEQ will look into the whole situation, including the ‘agreement’ referenced by Billings Animal Control.”
A Sept. 11 statement by the Billings Police Department, which runs the city’s animal control program, said the department and “partner agencies” have “long used the incinerator for narcotics destruction.” 
The regulatory role of the county health department in this situation is to “ensure that the burn occurs within a permitted facility, with an operational incinerator that has been inspected regularly,” Forte wrote.
It was unclear what drugs they were allowed to burn, what they weren’t allowed to burn and what exactly the agreement between Billings Police and Animal Control, the county health department, and any relevant federal agencies for burning drugs was.
The incinerator system in question operates from 1,400 to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit and is a closed-loop system, according to the RiverStone Health statement.
“The equipment utilized also contains specialized afterburners and filtration systems to reduce emissions into the community with no risk to the public’s health when functioning properly,” Forte wrote.
He also laid out what the Health Department’s role in this situation is.
“RiverStone Health is contracted with DEQ to provide local compliance inspections, air quality monitoring, approval of alternative burn permits, and quarterly reports of all activities to DEQ, as part of the Yellowstone Air Quality Control Program,” Forte wrote. “Billings Police Department and the City of Billings followed the established protocols for notifying RiverStone Health environmental health staff of the scheduled burn on September 10, 2025, and it was approved based on the information provided.”

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said states need to be “creative and innovative” in how they think about learning — and don’t need the bureaucracy of Washington, D.C., in the way.
McMahon made her remarks Friday at a roundtable with Gov. Greg Gianforte at Montana State University in Bozeman, the largest public university in the state.
At the roundtable, MSU students and representatives from industry talked about the importance of connecting education with the needs of the private sector and the benefits of the trades at Gallatin College.
“You guys probably know this statistic, but the fastest growing class of millionaires in the country are trade skills,” McMahon said. “So keep working.”
In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that private equity firms were investing in skilled trades and minting a new class of millionaires.
Gianforte, a Bozeman Republican and entrepreneur-turned-politician, said he wanted McMahon to see that Montana is leading the way in innovation. He touted more than 3,000 apprenticeships in various trades in Montana and “record low unemployment.”
The Governor’s Office announced on Friday an unemployment rate of 2.9% in August, “the eleventh straight month under 3% and over four consecutive years of unemployment at or below 3.4%, a new record.”
Gianforte, whose Gianforte Family Foundation made a $50 million donation to MSU to support cybersecurity, optics and photonics, and engineering, said a strong partnership between the private sector and higher education means better outcomes for students.
“That’s why we’ve made such a priority in our administration to align workforce with education, so that our students can have brighter futures and our economy continues to grow, so that people can pursue the American dream,” Gianforte said.
The governor said he appreciates McMahon’s interest in all 50 states to “understand what we face” and to “be a better partner” — and he’s seen progress on the partnership.

Republican President Donald Trump’s appointment of McMahon to head the Department of Education has been controversial and led to legal battles and protests.
Trump charged McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration during his first term and an executive with World Wrestling Entertainment, with shuttering the department in a bid to increase efficiency.
But some education groups and many Democrats argue the plan to dismantle the agency will hurt vulnerable students.
At the roundtable, McMahon said bureaucracy at the federal level — “we don’t hire teachers, we don’t buy books” — should not get in the way of “having more funds flow into the states to get to students.”
“The president certainly believes that every child should have access to a quality education,” McMahon said. “But we need to look at education differently.”
She said innovation means skills-based learning and understanding the needs of businesses. McMahon also said literacy is her top priority.
Courtney Johnson, of Johnson Metal Works in Bozeman, said the company is excited to have a pipeline of students from Gallatin College who meet their workforce needs.
She said some students make six figures right out of school.
“They have nicer trucks than us,” Johnson said.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen, who also participated in the roundtable, said career training is a focus for the Office of Public Instruction too.
For example, she said OPI is sending interactive lesson plans and materials to help teachers teach photonics to elementary and middle school children.
“We are trying to make sure that kids get an early introduction and see these as options,” Hedalen said.
After the roundtable, Hedalen said children get excited about things like light sabers and robotics and lasers, and they excel with the hands-on learning.
She also pointed to one example of a disconnect between a federal regulation and the classroom.
She said Carl Perkins funds for Career and Technical Education can be used only for permanent items such as machinery or tools — but the money can’t be used to buy wood in shop class.
“Obviously, for the student to complete a project in wood shop, you need the lumber,” Hedalen said.
At the close of the discussion, MSU President Brock Tessman presented McMahon with a special pin.
He said the pins are reserved only for the executive team and “guests who’ve shown exemplary partnership and support for our university.”
“You’re our first external guest to receive this,” said Tessman, who took the helm of the flagship this summer.
Pointing to a painting of the headwaters of the Missouri River, Tessman said he thinks of MSU as the headwaters of the state’s future, rural America’s future and the future of the country.
“This is a special time for this campus,” Tessman said. “We’re bursting at the seams because of the innovation and the partnership that you learned a little bit about around this table.”



Hedalen: ‘Montana knows what’s best’
Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen confirmed Friday federal funds for education in Montana remain intact.
Hedalen, who took office in January, also said she backs President Donald Trump’s vision of removing bureaucracy in the Department of Education and the ensuing staff reductions there.
“Montana knows what’s best for our students, and returning more control and funding directly to the state is a step in the right direction,” Hedalen said.

Hedalen spoke to the Daily Montanan following an education roundtable at Montana State University that included Gov. Greg Gianforte, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, and MSU President Brock Tessman.
Hedalen also said she spoke one-on-one with McMahon during her visit, and the secretary was engaged and interested to hear about the needs of Montana.
The superintendent said she shared the way Montana uses technology to ensure rural students have opportunities and discussed how to meet needs in a state with one-room schoolhouses.
She said she and McMahon both share an interest in early literacy as a priority.
Hedalen said McMahon understands the importance of special education and appreciates the work of paraprofessionals, and Hedalen said she herself does not anticipate changes to special education funding — which would take an act of Congress.
Hedalen also said she does not intend to buck the Trump administration’s cuts to education — but she is prepared to advocate for Montana schools and funding streams that are critical.
She said it’s important to peel out a layer of bureaucracy as McMahon has argued in order to focus on the needs of Montana and reduce red tape — filling out reports takes time, she said, and there’s a cost to it.
“I want our administrators to be able to be instructional leaders rather than filling out paperwork and reports,” Hedalen said.
She also said she’s advocating for other funding, such as state funding, to help English learners. Hedalen said Montana is one of the few states that doesn’t put money into English learning.
She said partnerships with business and industry can help when it comes to funding too.
Even with staff reductions at the department, Hedalen said Montana educators continue to have open lines of communication with their federal managers, and she herself will continue to advocate for students in the Treasure State.
“We know our schools and what they need best, especially with the rural nature and demographics of Montana,” Hedalen said.

After superintendent warns of harm to students from ""slurs, symbols, and discriminatory behavior,” parents and community members criticize administration for inaction.

Three weeks into the new school year, an 11-year-old Northfield middle school student has already faced multiple instances of harassment, according to his mother, who has reported the incidents to the school administration. 
And it’s just one instance in an apparent pattern of harassment and recent acts of hate across the Central Vermont Supervisory Union.
“My child has been harassed, going on three years now,” said the Northfield parent, who asked not to be identified for fear of her son facing retaliation in a community that residents and community leaders say is grappling with racism, harassment and bullying.
The parent said her son is a trans student who is trying to find his identity and just started attending middle school in Northfield. When he was in elementary school, his mother reported to administrators instances of another student harassing him, she said. But that information was never passed on to staff at the middle school, she said. The student who harassed the boy the past two years is now in his class again, and the harassment continues.
The harassment has included “a lot of misgendering” and being called  “a whore and a slut,” she said.
Superintendent Matthew Fedders from the Central Vermont Supervisory Union — which includes six schools in East Barre, Northfield, Washington and Williamstown — put out a letter on Sept. 12 to the community outlining a spike in hate in schools, without naming any particular incidents. 
In it, he pledged more support to students and families who are being harmed, and he called on families to “partner with us by discussing these issues openly at home and helping children understand the harm caused by slurs, symbols, and discriminatory behavior.”“These acts are unacceptable. While they may appear ‘isolated’ to some, their impact is not. For those directly targeted, they are painful reminders that hate can surface even in spaces that should be safe,” Fedders wrote.
Two days later, a group of anonymous residents responded with an open letter alleging the district is not just failing to take adequate measures to combat hate but “has given hate fertile soil in which to grow” by “consistently refusing” to name and denounce specific instances.
The letter states that students in the district have been called the N-word, trannies, sluts, whores and Black monkeys, and swastikas have been drawn on school buses and in restrooms. 
It further alleges that children of color have received “harsher discipline than their white peers” in the district and “disabled children have had their legal rights denied to them by the very educators who are tasked with upholding them,” the letter states. The letter did not provide specifics or evidence about the incidents. 
Fedders’ office said Thursday the superintendent was unable to respond to questions about the criticisms from the concerned residents outlined in the letter that VTDigger forwarded.
“He is also unable to comment on the letter from ‘Disappointed members of the Northfield community,’ as we have not yet received it,” Alysha Sickles, his executive assistant, wrote in an email.
Lack of follow up
The parent of the Northfield trans student, formerly a paraeducator in the Northfield school system, is among about two dozen residents who stand behind the unsigned community letter that has been shared via email and on social media. VTDigger has confirmed that at least five Northfield residents support the letter.
Also among them is Ryan Harlow, a Northfield resident and after-school administrator at the middle and high school, who has consistently spoken up at board meetings about the district’s inaction regarding harassment.
“The visible response from school leadership following each of these events has been mostly invisible from the perspective of non-administrator observers in the community and public,” reads the letter he submitted to the Paine Mountain School District that represents the towns of Northfield and Williamstown.
“As I have flagged before, there has been a throwing up of hands while administrators cite privacy concerns or scapegoat political figures on the national level. But there has been no apparent effort to ‘get out in front’ of issues in a way that would lead to community healing.  Individual discipline seems to happen at times, but teachable moments are habitually missed at the community level,” reads the letter he shared with VTDigger.
Although restrictions under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevent him from discussing particular cases, Harlow, whose job puts him in close contact with students and parents, confirmed the Northfield parent and her son have been reporting negative incidents “for years” without adequate responses from Northfield schools. He said the Central Valley School District fails to consistently keep track of and document an affected student’s experiences and needs.
“It is exceedingly rare for me to be proactively given any heads up about a student’s disciplinary history, their history as a victim of hazing, harassment, and bullying,” he said. This extends to students who are on an Individualized Education Program, which outlines their special education service plans and relevant medical history. 
“This information siloing has been a point of frustration for others as well,” he added.
Northfield resident Kelly Murch said her family has been “personally impacted by these problems.” In her public comment, delivered remotely via video call at the Paine Mountain board meeting Sept. 17, she asked the superintendent and board to provide “guidance and resources” to better equip school staff to discuss these issues with students.
“I think it would be great if there were specific resources offered publicly from the district to families as well, who might be interested in starting anti racist work in their own household,” she said.
Principals in the six-school district did not respond immediately to requests for comment this week.
‘Words alone are not enough’
Both letters were discussed this week in the Paine Mountain School District’s board meeting, which is part of the consolidated Central Vermont Supervisory Union.
Dan Morris, the board’s chair, said in his statement that the board “does not accept or tolerate racist, bigoted, or hateful acts in our schools” and is “deeply troubled” by the recent instances of homophobia, transphobia and hate outlined in the anonymous residents’ letter. He said he believes communities need to hear a “clear statement” on “these very troubling developments.”
The instances of hate “have a very real negative impact,” he said, and the board is committed to “eradicating hateful, bigoted, and racist language and imagery from our buildings.”
“Students can’t learn when histories of widespread violence against their demographic group are displayed in front of them. They can’t learn when they are constantly getting the message that they are inferior and unwelcome. They can’t learn when they are made to constantly feel unsafe,” he said in the personal statement that he shared with VTDigger.
Staff outlined training and restorative justice circles conducted by schools in response to hate and harassment in an effort to “demonstrate the positive.” They said conversations this week have encouraged middle and high school students to discuss the kinds of harassment, bullying and negative language and actions they are experiencing, seeing or hearing about.
“It doesn’t feel to me like now is the time for restorative circles and education,” said Danielle Moffatt, a Paine Mountain board member. Students know when they use certain words and engage in bad behavior, she said, calling for stronger measures to dissuade them.
“Those words have been wrong since they were 5 and you’re in high school. So I’m thinking that the reason they’re doing it is because the consequence is not strong enough to disincentivize the behavior,” Moffatt said.
Mia Schultz, president of the Rutland Area NAACP, also called for action.
“While the superintendent’s letter names the problem, the Northfield community is right to point out that words alone are not enough,” Schultz said.
“If we are serious about protecting children, schools must move past statements and into action,” she said, centering the most impacted families and students in shaping solutions.
This includes clear accountability when harm happens, robust education about racism, antisemitism and ableism, and the hiring and retention of educators who reflect the diversity of our communities, she added.
The parent of the trans student said she has not seen that level of accountability nor a victim-centered approach for her son in past years. If anything, the opposite is true. 
“What they did in the elementary school was they had my child come up with a plan on how to support them in their gender identity,” she said.
After she informed the middle school about the past and the ongoing harassment her son continues to face, school leaders initiated a hazing, harassment and bullying investigation that determined this week the reported harassment was substantiated, she said.
“I hope that something will change,” the parent said. “There just needs to be more education and using these opportunities to have a teaching moment … to have school wide assemblies and say, ‘This is what’s happening right now.’”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderATLANTA —  A key vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indefinitely postponed a controversial change to guidelines on administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborn babies, and altered long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed. 
The panel also voted to reverse a decision they made only yesterday that would have prevented updated guidelines on the MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, from applying to children enrolled in the Vaccines for Children program. 
CDC vaccine panel votes to limit use of a childhood vaccine as COVID, hepatitis B decisions loom

Vaccines for Children is a federal program which covers the cost of vaccines for more than half of American children. The decision to implement different standards for children enrolled in VFC caused confusion among top health officials as well as some committee members when it was introduced Thursday. 
Jason Goldman, the president of the American College of Physicians who also serves as a liaison to the committee, criticized Thursday’s vote, arguing that the changes were not backed by scientific evidence. 
“Would you consider that the second vote actually revealed the truth, that you do not have the data or evidence to challenge the current standing and that there is no associated harm?” Goldman asked the committee.
The committee’s reversal on Friday standardizes the updated MMRV vaccine recommendations for all children. If ACIP’s recommendations are approved by CDC officials, doctors will be required to administer separate MMR and varicella vaccines for all children under 4 years of age.
ACIP tables a rule delaying Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns
In what appeared to be another reversal, the panel shelved a resolution that sought to alter current CDC recommendations around hepatitis B vaccines for newborn children. 
The current three-dose series for hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that attacks the liver, includes one vaccine administered to infants within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given a month and six months after the initial dose. ACIP has been recommending a hepatitis B vaccine for all babies within a day of being born since 1991, which resulted in a 99% drop in serious infections between 1990 and 2019.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

If ACIP members choose to implement the changes at a later meeting, official CDC guidelines will recommend that pediatricians delay administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until 30 days after birth for all children whose mothers test negative for the disease.
The panel did not provide any evidence indicating that delaying the vaccine improved children’s health, or that there were any widespread or serious instances of harm caused by administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborns. However, some ACIP members also cast doubt on the accuracy of data showing the shot is safe.
“I think that there are gaps in what we know and understand about the effects of hepatitis B, particularly on very young infants,” said Vicky Pebsworth, a committee member who is a registered nurse and who sits on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, which advocates for vaccine exemptions. “I think that the conclusion that we know that it is safe is, perhaps, premature.” 
Dr. Adam Langer, who serves as the principal deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention, urged the panel to reconsider narrowing the recommendations.
“One of the primary reasons for recommending universal birth dose in the U.S. is to serve as a safety net for infants born to mothers with unknown test results,” Langer said during his presentation to the committee on Thursday. 
“To date, no country in the world has reverted from universal to selective birth dose recommendations,” he added.
The meeting, which was held at the CDC’s Chamblee campus, also inspired a demonstration organized by a group of former CDC workers, who dressed up as preventable diseases and waved signs to the passing cars while the meeting was underway. 
Cindy Weinbaum, who retired from the CDC in 2021, said Friday that it was commendable that the committee skipped a vote that would have recommended babies not be vaccinated for hepatitis B within a day after being born, which is the current standard. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder
Cindy Weinbaum, who spent about a decade of her career at the CDC in the division of viral hepatitis, said she commended the committee for deciding to table a vote that would have changed the recommendations for hepatitis B vaccinations.
“I think it’s really commendable, actually, that they delayed this vote because they do not know the implications of not recommending a birth dose of hepatitis B,” Weinbaum said.
“So that was a nod to their lack of understanding of vaccine programs, vaccine science and the importance of certain vaccinations for kids,” she added.
Weinbaum said the proposal’s appearance on the committee’s agenda reflects the “vaccine nihilism that the current administration is supporting.” She said the shot given to newborns within the first day of their life has found itself in the “cross hairs of the anti-vax movement.”
“It’s because here’s this newborn baby and you’re very vulnerable, and sticking it with a needle is kind of a scary thing,” she said. “They just don’t understand that it’s even more scary to get liver cancer, and that’s really what we want to prevent.”
ACIP moves to center vaccine harm
Though the committee did not implement some of its more controversial proposals, ACIP’s new members have signaled that they would like to place a greater focus on examples of vaccine harm and adverse outcomes in future policy proposals.
They have also rejected widely embraced data on vaccine safety, choosing instead to focus on isolated cases and dubious studies, including one paper claiming that rats exposed to the COVID-19 vaccine exhibited “autism-like behaviors” that was eventually retracted by the journal that published it.
Some ACIP members, including Robert Malone, also pushed back against guidelines that advise vaccinating young children and pregnant women, arguing that there is a lack of data proving definitively that vaccines are safe. 
“The default should be the assumption that there is no intervention in the infant and the pregnant woman with the vaccine unless there is definitive evidence of safety,” Malone said.
But Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College who has served as a past committee member, pushed back against the argument that any medical intervention should be entirely risk-free.
“I just want to point out that it’s very, very difficult to prove the absence of harm, it’s simply not a practical objective,” Meissner said.
“I think it’s important for everyone to understand that no vaccine is 100% safe and no vaccine is 100% effective,” he added. “What’s important for the provider before administering a vaccine is to think about that particular patient and does the benefit of protection exceed any possible side effect from the vaccine.”

But in a conversation with reporters after the meeting, Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, signaled that the committee could revisit other vaccine recommendations in future meetings.
“I think we need to review vaccines, in general, from time to time,” Levi said. “It’s part of a good process. I don’t think that I need now to single out one vaccine or another. I think that, in general, it’s actually in the mission of ACIP. . . to actually review every vaccine.”

Photo credit: Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon with the Atlanta Civic Circle An immigration judge ordered Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara to be deported on Friday despite a pending First Amendment case in federal court, setting off a frenzied attempt by his attorneys to stop the deportation from happening. 
Guevara was arrested earlier this summer while covering an anti-ICE protest in DeKalb County. His arrest has alarmed free speech advocates and attracted national attention. 
Friday’s ruling relies on a 2012 order stemming from Guevara’s request for asylum in 2005. While his request was initially denied, the case was administratively closed on appeal which paused deportation proceedings against Guevara indefinitely, but not permanently. The new order concluded that a previous immigration judge was prohibited from issuing Guevara bond in July due to that order.
Sandy Springs Democratic state Sen. Josh McLaurin, who is also an attorney, spoke against the immigration judge’s decision at a hastily called press conference Friday. 
“I want to make something clear. This is not a court in the traditional sense. This is not the judiciary with Senate-confirmed judges. The Board of Immigration Affairs is an executive agency with judges appointed by other executive officials that are responsible to the Trump administration. So make no mistake, this is not an isolated incident. This is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to silence and chill journalists for doing their jobs,” McLaurin said.
Following the immigration judge’s ruling this year, that 2012 deportation case was reopened, enabling Guevara’s deportation to now happen at any moment. 
Guevara’s attorneys had also been trying to argue in federal court that his continued detention by ICE is illegal on First Amendment grounds. Guevara’s legal team, led by the ACLU of Georgia, is seeking a restraining order preventing the federal government from deporting Guevara while this case is still pending in federal court. 
An emergency hearing was called in that case late Friday afternoon. While supporters had hoped a restraining order would be granted immediately, the judge instead requested attorneys on both sides to submit additional briefs by next week. It’s unclear if federal authorities will attempt to deport Guevara while the restraining order is still pending.
Guevara was arrested on June 14. He was transferred into ICE custody from the DeKalb County Jail under the terms of a controversial 2024 Georgia immigration law. 
Originally from El Salvador, Guevara has lived and worked legally in the United States for the past 20 years, according to his attorneys. He fled El Salvador for fear of political violence due to his work as a journalist. A longtime journalist for Spanish-language outlet Mundo Hispanico, he founded his own newsroom, MGNews, in 2024.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)MOBRIDGE — Days before the end of her term, the first woman elected chair of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said South Dakota leaders could learn something from their neighbors to the north.
Janet Alkire, a U.S. Air Force veteran, twice served as the tribe’s executive director before being elected as chairwoman in 2021. 
On Friday at the Grand River Resort near Mobridge, she told the South Dakota State-Tribal Relations Committee she’ll continue to work “from afar” for her people. 
The tribe of 16,000 members — 11,000 of whom live on the reservation that spans the border of North and South Dakota — will elect a chair, vice chair, and eight tribal council members Wednesday. 
Cabinet office with tribal leaders helps in North Dakota
Standing Rock members are “tri-citizens,” Alkire said, of the tribe, the states and the federal government. Because Standing Rock straddles two states, that means Alkire and other tribal leaders have six members of Congress to lobby.
“I’m pretty sure they’re tired of us, because we visit them a lot,” Alkire said.
Standing Rock leaders raise concerns about federal funding in meeting with ND, SD governors

On Friday, she told State-Tribal Relations Committee members that trust and relationships between the state and tribes hinge on frequent and respectful communication.
Committee member Scott Odenbach, the Republican House majority leader from Spearfish, wanted to know if he and his counterparts in state government could learn anything from North Dakota’s approach to working with tribes. 
Communication is the prime place for improvement with South Dakota, Alkire said. 
The state’s annual legislative sessions offer more opportunities to engage with lawmakers and pursue legislation than in North Dakota, where lawmakers meet every other year. But North Dakota has an Indian Affairs Commission that facilitates year-round connections.
“We actually meet with them quite often, because they’re coming out of the governor’s office and they’re right there at the Legislature, monitoring what’s going on,” Alkire said.
That commission includes North Dakota’s governor, the leaders of North Dakota’s tribes and three at-large members, two of whom must be Native American. The office also has an executive director and three other full-time staff members.
Standing Rock Council Member Cyril Archambault is the tribe’s North Dakota legislative liaison. He’s in frequent contact with commission members on legislation. The commission meets quarterly, holds at least two training sessions for tribes each year and holds spot events as needed.
South Dakota has similar entities, including the committee that met Friday and the Department of Tribal Relations, but Archambault said the comparison ends there.
“I don’t see much commitment from South Dakota. I’ll just be honest,” he said.
Standing Rock chair stresses building unity and infrastructure

Nola Taken Alive, another Standing Rock council member in attendance Friday, noted that her tribe has a healthy relationship with North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden has met with Standing Rock leaders, which Taken Alive said signaled potential improvement in relations.
His predecessor, current U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, had a strained relationship with tribes. Taken Alive attributed what she described as “friction” between Noem and tribes to “blatant disrespect, at times” from Noem. She pointed to comments Noem made last year about drug cartels allegedly operating on reservations. All nine tribal governments voted to ban Noem from their lands last year, for those comments and for saying Native American children “don’t have any hope.”
“With Governor Armstrong, he’s always reaching out,” Taken Alive said of North Dakota’s leader. “That’s a healthy relationship.”
Federal outreach to continue
Alkire noted that Standing Rock and South Dakota’s other tribal nations face similar challenges with law enforcement and health care funding. Standing Rock needs 30 officers, for example, but only has funding enough for 10.
Changes to Medicare and Medicaid embedded in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed this summer by Congress, she said, will ripple across state and tribal borders.
“The tribes in South Dakota, all nine of them, realize that the relationships that we have with the state are very important,” Alkire said.
During a break in the committee meeting, Alkire told South Dakota Searchlight that the ascension of former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to Interior secretary offers another avenue to maximize the impact of tribal issues in Washington, D.C.
Standing Rock had a working relationship with Burgum, who intends to maintain the secretary’s Tribal Advisory Committee. Alkire represented the Great Plains for former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on her version of the committee.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also intends to maintain such a committee. That has Alkire hopeful, as well.
“That is the best line of communication,” she said. “I mean, they can communicate within their agencies, but you need to hear the perspective of the tribes.”
As for her plan after she leaves office, Alkire said it can be summed up in one word.
“Rest,” she said.

Mike Sexton, R-Rockwell City, will leave his position in the state Legislature to head Iowa’s Rural Development office under the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Sexton, who recently chaired the Iowa House Agriculture Committee, was first elected in 2014. His new position, which is a presidential appointment, was announced Friday by USDA and Iowa House Republicans. 
“It truly has been an honor to serve for House District 7 and the people of Iowa as a State Representative,” Sexton said in a news release. “I am deeply grateful for the trust and support of my constituents over these years, and for the opportunity to work alongside dedicated colleagues to advance meaningful legislation. I carry with me immense gratitude for the experiences, relationships, and progress we’ve achieved together.”

Sexton is also a fourth-generation farmer and raises sheep outside of Rockwell City. 
Speaker of the Iowa House Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford, said Sexton was a “steadfast leader” for Iowa’s agricultural community. 
“Representative Sexton’s commitment, and his tireless work ethic will leave a lasting impact,” Grassley said in a news release. “…His advocacy for our farmers and rural communities has helped strengthen our state’s backbone. I wish him the very best.”
Sexton will now lead Iowa’s USDA Rural Development office which manages federal funding for energy, broadband development, water infrastructure and more in rural communities.
Sexton replaces acting director Kate Sand, who followed former President Joe Biden’s appointee Theresa Greenfield. 
Sexton’s appointment was announced among a slew of appointments to other states. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins welcomed the new appointees in a statement Friday. 
“Today’s new USDA presidential appointments will help carry forward the important work of serving the people who feed and fuel our country, delivering real results for rural America, putting our Farmers First,” Rollins said. “Together, we will continue to strengthen our food supply, protect our family farms, and ensure USDA is working on behalf of the American people.”

Now, she plans to submit comments for the Congressional Record explaining what occurred and her stance on the seven-week stopgap spending bill that did pass 217-212. 
“I was on the floor casting a ‘yes’ vote, but my vote was not acknowledged by the presiding officer,” Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement released by her office. Gluesenkamp Perez, of Skamania County, represents the 3rd Congressional District in southwest Washington.
In a separate statement, the congresswoman said she supported the legislation because she “could not in good conscience vote to shut our government down, which would have made health care and food even more expensive for millions of Americans while handing the executive branch even more control over the nuts and bolts of the administrative apparatus.”
Republicans seized on the two-term congresswoman’s faux pas.
“As usual, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez talks a good game, but she’s not there for us when it counts,” said state Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, who has launched a campaign to unseat her in 2026. He is the minority leader of the Washington state Senate.

For North Carolinians, that means remembering that voters split tickets and that it’s routine for Democrats and Republicans to win statewide elections.
“North Carolina was purple before purple was a thing,” said Brinson Bell, who participated Friday in an online forum on trust in elections sponsored by the media organization Votebeat.
“We had one of the most conservative U.S. senators in Jesse Helms serving at the same time as one of the more progressive governors that North Carolina has ever had in Jim Hunt,” she said. “That just speaks to North Carolina voters.”
In 2020, when Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump, Republicans in every state were “grumpy” about elections, with Republicans in states where Trump narrowly lost a bit more unhappy than the rest, said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at MIT. At the same time, Democrats “believed election officials could do no wrong,” he said. 
“Distrust in elections is more likely to be driven by national rather than local events,” he said.

Polls found that Republicans’ confidence in election results increased after Trump won last year, 
But Seth Bluestein, a Republican on the three-member commission that runs elections in Philadelphia, said he feared that trust is not sustainable. 
Trump made unsupported claims last year about cheating in Philadelphia, which officials had to refute, Bluestein said. Once the polls closed and it was clear Trump won the state, those accusations stopped.
National leaders need to “tone down the rhetoric,” he said. 
“What I see is the national rhetoric from party leaders filtering down and being repeated by legislators, who are then trying to pass laws that will actually make election integrity worse, or make it harder for elections officials to run the elections at the county level,” Bluestein said. 
Brinson Bell noted that she started her tenure as North Carolina elections director after a ballot harvesting scandal in a congressional race and ended it with a candidate for state Supreme Court refusing to concede his narrow loss. She was talking about Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin, though she did not mention him by name.
“The transparency was there, the data was there, people could understand that this election had been conducted fairly, yet the candidate did not concede until May of 2025,” she said.
Griffin had challenged more than 60,000 votes, many because he claimed voters did not included required identification numbers on their voter registration forms. After the case meandered through state and federal courts, a federal district judge said the effort to throw out votes was unconstitutional and ordered Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat, be certified as the winner.
The US Department of Justice sued the Board of Elections this year over the missing voter registration identifiers. Elections officials are working to collect the numbers from voters. The DOJ and the state settled the case.
Though confidence in elections is rising, there are now more grassroots groups that profit from fomenting dissatisfaction than there were in 2020, Stewart said. 
“Even if confidence gets better, there’s the rest of the process that leads to the chaos that we observe,” Stewart said. “I think the situation is kind of dicey these days.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Voting-booths-Getty.jpg,,,2025-09-19 18:57:31.119591

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine led the country in enshrining the “right to food” in its state constitution. But the subjugation of the Wabanaki Nations has complicated that right for the original inhabitants of the land.
Anthony Sutton, assistant professor of Native American Programs and Cooperative Extension at the University of Maine, highlighted the differences between the traditional ways Indigenous communities use natural resources for food and cultural practices and the state’s current food sovereignty laws during his keynote speech at the Common Ground Fair in Unity on Friday.
“If we’re going to do the work of food sovereignty seriously, we need to recognize the rights that are allowed and the ones that aren’t,” said Sutton, who is also a faculty fellow of the university’s Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions. 
In 2021, Maine became the first state to establish a right to food in its state constitution when voters approved an amendment by referendum. This right is defined as the ability of all people to “grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being.” 
The amendment built on the state’s food sovereignty law passed in 2017, which lets municipalities adopt ordinances that exempt local and direct producer-to-consumer food sales from some state regulations. 
When Maine established these rights, Sutton said his Passamaquoddy mentor Ed Basset asked: What does this mean for tribal sustenance? 
The Wabanaki Nations – the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation – are treated differently than other federally recognized tribes. This is because of a 1980 land settlement agreement that has left them with a relationship to the state more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations.  
The Tribes have been pushing for legislative changes that recognize the Wabanaki Nations’ inherent rights to self-governance, economic development and resource management for years. But Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has so far rejected overhauling the agreement and instead approved some piecemeal adjustments on a case-by-case basis.
While Maine’s food freedom policies allow municipalities to manage local food businesses as a form of economic security, Sutton pointed out that the municipal distinction given to Wabanaki governments has had negative impacts. 
Candidates’ support signals tribal rights may be a top issue for Maine’s next governor

A 2022 Harvard Kennedy School study concluded that the Wabanaki Nations’ inability to self-govern has stunted economic growth, both their own and the state’s. 
Definitions are key when considering the impacts of state laws on tribal rights, Sutton said. 
From the state of Maine’s perspective, sustenance means, “if I grab a fish out of the Unity stream with my bare hands, because that’s how I fish,” Sutton said jokingly, “and I put it on my table for my family, that’s sustenance.”
But Sutton said that definition oversimplifies sustenance and avoids the complex ways people of different backgrounds access and use food. That way of defining sustenance also has consequences for the broader idea of food sovereignty.
“We talk about rights, and if we do that, we must talk about ways to ensure those rights are met across a range of geographies by everyone in substantive and meaningful ways,” Sutton said. 
For example, Maine’s food sovereignty legislation centers small-scale “traditional” farming.
“Whose notion of traditional are we using?” Sutton questioned. “If we’re going to go real tradition, we would start with our creation stories, the stories that not only teach us skills, but the values and knowledge needed for caretaking.”
Municipal boundaries are another complicating factor when assessing tribal sustenance under the state’s food freedom laws, Sutton said. 
While these policies support local food production within municipal boundaries, he explained that many Wabanaki foodways require movement that transcends such artificial boundaries. 
“It’s the movement between those places and the knowledge systems that makes growing and distributing corn possible today, though Maine’s sovereignty legislation isn’t particularly good at dealing with movement,” Sutton said. 
Land disposition also plays a role, as the Wabanaki Nations today have ownership over only a fraction of the land they originated. 
“In short, non-Indigenous management systems are not good at thinking about the future — five, 10, 20 years, maybe, sure,” Sutton said. “But in Wabanaki notions of care, we’re considering how we act shapes the future abilities for our grandchildren’s grandchildren to be in relation with the land and water, which is something that we can all benefit from.”
The Maine Legislature is expected to consider another omnibus tribal sovereignty bill when lawmakers reconvene in January. That legislation aims to adopt the recommendations from the task force the state convened to study the settlement act in 2019. Several suggestions included changes that would provide the Wabanaki Nations with the authority to restrict hunting and fishing by non-tribal citizens on tribal lands.
Another bill that will be up for debate would provide an exception to Penobscot Nation citizens to prohibitions against buying, selling or offering for sale certain wild animals and wild birds.
Lawmakers could also consider a proposal to send another constitutional amendment to the voters to establish the right to hunt and fish. The chambers couldn’t agree on it this year and the bill was ultimately carried over into the next session.

(Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix).TAMPA — Local government officials throughout Florida should be among the most interested viewers tuning into the Florida Channel next week when the House Select Committee on Property Taxes convenes for the first time in months in Tallahassee.
Some of those concerns — and excitement — about the still-unwritten plan promoted to substantially reduce or eliminate property taxes for Florida homeowners was discussed at the Tampa Tiger Bay meeting on Friday.
The challenge for local public officials debating a likely constitutional amendment to that effect on next year’s ballot in Florida is that no one knows exactly what the proposal will call for.
All options on the table
“Do you think the constitutional amendment will give the either/or, so if we do away with property taxes for homesteaded properties that at the same time we’ll have a choice to make on how that happens?” Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Bob Henriquez asked state Rep. Berny Jacques (R-Seminole). “Or do you think the complete proposal includes some form of backfill?”
“It’s too early to say one way or another,” Jacques responded. “All options are on the table.”
Jacques went on to say that not every local government was the same in Florida in terms of how reliant they are on property taxes to fund essential services. He mentioned that Largo — a city he represents — brought in $239 million in revenues last fiscal year, with only $39 million from ad valorem property taxes. And only 23% of that revenue was from homestead properties.
“I think that they can do just fine, especially when they look under the hood and make key priorities about what’s necessary and what’s not.”
However, some municipalities and counties in Florida rely heavily on property taxes to run substantial parts of their  local governments.
“I look under the hood in the city of Tampa, our crime’s the lowest it’s been in decades,” said Tampa City Councilman Alan Clendenin. “This is not accidental, because we’ve had the investment in crime prevention in our police and our first responders.”
According to Tampa Mayor Jane Castor’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget, every dollar of Tampa’s $380 million in property tax revenue is allocated to police and fire services.
Hillsborough County Commissioner Josh Wostal is a supporter of providing tax relief to owners of homesteaded properties in Florida. He floated his own proposal to get rid of all property taxes in the county and make up the loss of revenue by raising the sales tax in the county by 3.5%. He said the part of that could be subsidized by visitors.
“About 20-30% of people who [pay sales taxes] don’t even live here. That’s free money,” he said. “That’s relief for the fixed-income senior citizens and low-income citizens that own property that yes, while the more affluent people feel the sting of property taxes the most, the poor people and mixed-income citizens feel the burden the most because it’s ever increasing and inescapable. You can choose not to pay a sales tax. You cannot choose not to pay a property tax. “
However, state legislators working on the proposal say that a complete elimination of property taxes – while espoused on the campaign trail by Gov. Ron DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia – is not on the table.
“We can certainly talk about it,” said Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, co-chair of the select committee on property tax, told Spectrum News this week. “However, the direction’s that been given to me at this point in time is that the total elimination of property tax is not something that we would likely be putting forward in a constitutional amendment.”
‘A Tallahassee grab’?
No one on the panel was more critical of the proposal to reduce property taxes than Clendenin, a longtime Florida member of the Democratic National Committee. He said that it was absolutely critical that it fail at the ballot next year “because it will so adversely impact our first responders and the security and safety of our community and our state.”

But he received serious pushback by Jacques, who rejected Clendenin’s assertion that it was “a Tallahassee grab to seize power so that your local officials are no longer accountable to the citizens.”
“This idea that this is kind of a grab from the state — nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, it’s empowering to people of the state,” said Jacques, referring to the fact that it will be the voters who decide.
“If that’s a power grab, then I guess I don’t know the definition of that, because you’re giving the people the choice,” he added.
Meanwhile, Rep. Ryan Chamberlain, R-Belleview, like Jacques a member of the House committee assigned to figure out what the proposed amendment on property taxes will look like, proposed his own “Freedom 1,2,3” proposal to reporters earlier this week.
“There is a political risk for me or anyone else who rolls out an actual plan, because immediately, there’s going to be those who organize opposition,” Chamberlin said. “It’s easy to talk about doing something about property taxes without ever getting specific about doing anything about it. But I’m convinced that we must have a starting point.”
Although local officials are critical of the idea, Gov. DeSantis and CFO Ingoglia continue to campaign around the state for the proposal. In Ingoglia’s case, his DOGE auditing team has been scrutinizing spending by some of the state’s biggest cities and counties and calling them out for what he alleges is unnecessary spending.
This week alone, Ingoglia travelled to Jacksonville and Orange County, where he accused both of those local governments of “wasting” $200 million and $190 million, respectively (local officials disagreed). The CFO said its important to call those local officials out now, so that they don’t start complaining next year that a reduction in property taxes will force cuts would devastate public safety and other essential services.
The House Select Committee on Property Taxes is scheduled to meet Monday at noon in the Capitol.

This week, he was granted further reprieve from deportation, according to Kitson. (Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Antonio Chairez Rios has spent the last three months living in Albuquerque with an ankle monitor, a daily reminder that at any moment he could be deported to Mexico amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push.
But yesterday, when he arrived for his scheduled check-in at the field office of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, agents instead removed the ankle monitor. Then they informed him that he only needed to check in once a year going forward, according to his lawyer Rebecca Kitson, instead of the appointments every month or so.
His emergence from the ICE field office marks at least the second time in several months that he’s dramatically avoided deportation. In early June, more than 100 protesters scheduled a last-minute demonstration outside the office, chanting “Keep Antonio here!” as Chairez Rios and his lawyer met with ICE agents.  
ICE offers Albuquerque immigrant reprieve — for now

Kitson told Source New Mexico on Friday that the grandfather of two, who has lived in Albuquerque for 20 years, was spared deportation this time around due to last-minute legal wrangling that ensured a federal official reviewed Chairez Rios’ long-pending visa application. 
The review found that Chairez Rios was likely to succeed in his quest for a “T visa,” given to immigrants who suffered human trafficking, which meant he received deferred action on the government’s efforts to deport him and an approved work permit, Kitson said. 
The approvals occurred a day or two before his scheduled ICE visit, which Kitson called “a nail biter.” Chairez Rios spent this week getting his affairs in order, expecting that he would be deported, she said. That meant figuring out where he could live, how to transfer title for his truck and connecting his bank accounts to Mexico, she said. 
“ICE had indicated to us that it wasn’t their intention to remove him,” Kitson said. “But I don’t really know how much anybody can rely on that type of assertion these days, especially with the pressure to complete the quotas.”

Kitson credited Chairez Rios for continuing to show up to ICE check-ins despite the threat of deportation, and she also reiterated her gratitude to the protesters who waited for three hours in the hot sun back in June. 
“It took a village to make it happen, but one starfish is back in the ocean, at least for now,” Kitson said. 
But she is troubled to think of how many people have been deported during ICE check-ins in Albuquerque, New Mexico and across the country. And she’s distressed that lawyers like her were required to force the government to do its job, including the timely review of visa applications.

State and county reviews found that Capt. Jason Gray was justified in his use of force in the incident that has resulted in a suspect facing attempted murder charges for firing on him.

File photo by K. Fiegenbaum/VTDigger.
A St. Johnsbury police captain who exchanged fire with a suspect won’t face any criminal charges in connection with the incident, according to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office. The suspect shot and injured the officer, who shot at the suspect but did not hit him.
The shooting that injured Capt. Jason Gray took place Dec. 13 in an apartment building in St. Johnsbury where police said they were investigating a report of domestic assault.
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office reviewed Gray’s use of force in firing back at the suspect, Scott Mason, and in a press release Thursday announced that they had determined that Gray’s actions were justified. 
“Under the totality of these circumstances,” the release stated, “both during and leading up to the shooting, an objectively reasonable officer in Captain Gray’s position would have concluded that there was no other reasonable alternative than the use of deadly force to prevent his death or serious bodily injury.”
Windham County State’s Attorney Steven Brown also declined to prosecute the case after completing his own independent review, according to the release.
Brown served as conflict counsel on behalf of the Caledonia County State’s Attorney’s Office in conducting the review.
About a day and a half following the shooting, police captured Mason in an apartment building near the one where the incident took place. 
Mason pleaded not guilty late last year to multiple charges, including attempted murder, in connection with the shooting of Gray. He remains in custody awaiting trial.
Gray had gone to Mason’s residence in a multi-unit apartment building as part of a domestic violence investigation. Gray walked up a flight of stairs with a fellow officer following him, according to a summary of the incident provided by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office. 
Seconds later, a round of pellet shots hit Gray as he was in the hallway. The other officer and the reported domestic violence victim fled, the summary stated. 
“Captain Gray then retreated behind a doorframe, drew his firearm, and peered down the hallway to locate the shooter when a second round of pellet shot hit Captain Gray,” according to the summary. 
“Simultaneously,” the summary added, “during this second round of pellet shots, Captain Gray discharged one bullet from his firearm in the direction of the shooter, but it did not strike the shooter or any other person.”
Gray then collapsed from his injuries, the summary stated, and while he was on the floor, he saw Mason carrying a shotgun. 
“Scott Mason approached Captain Gray and yelled, ‘get the [expletive] out,’ before fleeing the house through a second-floor window,” according to the summary. 
The search for Mason prompted the state to issue its first ever Blue Alert, which is used to inform the public of an ongoing search for someone suspected of injuring or killing a police officer.
After the shooting, an officer drove Gray by police car to Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital. Gray was later taken to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, for treatment of his extensive, but non-fatal injuries.
Gray has since retired from the St. Johnsbury police department, Town Manager Chad Whitehead said Friday in an email.
“The Town is pleased at the AG’s findings, and would not have expected any different outcome,” Whitehead added.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Most of the 308,662 Arkansans covered by the six health plans will not see the full rate increase thanks to subsidies offered by the federal Affordable Care Act, the release states. But those subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn’t act to extend them. 
ACA marketplace insurers are increasing premiums by an average of 20% in 2026, according to an August KFF analysis.
Centene manages three of the six Arkansas health plans: QualChoice, QCA Health and Celtics Insurance. Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield manages the other three plans: Health Advantage, USAble Mutual and USAble HMO.
The two parent companies initially proposed raising their premiums by 54.4% and 25.5%, respectively. Sanders asked Arkansas Insurance Commissioner Alan McClain to reject the proposals, saying she did not want insurance companies to “take advantage of our people.”
In the news release, Sanders said she negotiated with the two parent companies to propose lower rate hikes, which will go into effect Jan. 1 with approval from interim Insurance Commissioner Jimmy Harris. McClain left the position Sept. 1 to take a consulting job.
Five of the six plans will have lower premium increases than initially projected, with the exception of QualChoice Life. On average, the six plans’ increases are 35.6% lower than initially projected, according to the press release.
“More work remains, but this is a good starting point and shows that when we stand up to insurance companies, we can win tangible benefits for the people of our state,” Sanders said in the news release.
Permanent extension of federal health care subsidies estimated to cost $350 billion

In Washington D.C., congressional Democrats have been urging Republicans to extend the enhanced tax credits for certain people who buy their health insurance through the ACA marketplace. Democrats included the tax credits in a 2021 COVID-19 relief package and extended them in 2022.
Concerns about prices spiking during the open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1, have brought the issue of extending the tax credits to the forefront ahead of the Oct. 1 government shutdown deadline.
Passing an extension before Oct. 1 would decrease 2026 insurance premiums by 2.4% compared to previous projections, Congressional Budget Office Director Phillip Swagel wrote to federal lawmakers Thursday.
Permanently extending the tax credits would cost the government $350 billion over 10 years and insure 3.8 million more people, Swagel wrote.

New analysis reflects discussions with pro-feeding Wyoming, and the particulars will likely resemble the proposal expected soon from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife. 
The post Feds provide peek at National Elk Refuge plan: Keep feeding bison, cut off elk at 7% CWD appeared first on WyoFile .","There’s no saying what exactly the National Elk Refuge will propose when it rolls out its long-awaited plan detailing how it will handle a deadly disease forecasted to drastically reduce Jackson Hole elk populations, crushing hunting opportunities in the process. 
But a new scientific analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey provides a first glimpse of likely components in the refuge’s “preferred” option for dealing with chronic wasting disease on a 25,000-acre federal property where thousands of elk have been fed and unnaturally bunched up since 1912. Specifically, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may roll out a proposal that calls for perpetual feeding of the Jackson Bison Herd, a species that’s immune to CWD. For the Jackson Elk Herd, meanwhile, feeding would continue until rates of always-lethal chronic wasting disease reach 7%. 
The USGS analysis predicts what will happen if the refuge opts for increased hunting and a 7% CWD threshold for determining when to stop feeding elk. By year 20 of CWD spreading in the herd, rates of the disease will reach an estimated 25%. The population will fall as a result, declining 26% to an estimated 8,100 animals. 
Paul Cross, the USGS research biologist who authored the report, described the particulars of so-called “Alternative D” as a “middle ground.” The assessment supplemented an earlier, broader analysis that uses science to help the National Elk Refuge chart the best path forward.

Elk feeding began more than a century ago and has successfully increased winter survival and kept wapiti out of winter haylines, but the practice is considered antiquated, spreads disease, truncates migrations and poses an unprecedented threat to elk populations because of just-arrived CWD, which is always lethal. 
The particulars of “Alternative D” were selected based on discussions with wildlife managers, Cross said, naming the National Elk Refuge and Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 
Notably, Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish director, now oversees the poorly resourced Wildlife Refuge System that includes the National Elk Refuge. He was confirmed as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife director in early August. 
The forecast for “Alternative D” is more favorable for elk and elk hunters than if the National Elk Refuge goes with unchanged feeding. In the earlier analysis, that prognosis was for CWD to infect 35% of the Jackson Elk Herd, a rate that modeling predicts would slash the population by more than half, down to 5,200 animals.
The modeling assumed starting points of 11,000 elk and 1% CWD prevalence, both higher than the on-the-ground conditions today.
Elk fare similar under “Alternative D” to the herd’s prognosis if the refuge were to stop feeding cold turkey, the analysis shows. But the newly modeled scenario performs better in other respects, Cross said. 
“If you don’t feed, then [elk and bison] are going to be in other places more often,” Cross said. “That results in more calls to Wyoming Game and Fish, more complaints, more elk running around with volleyball nets on their head.”

The Fish and Wildlife Service did not authorize National Elk Refuge staff to give an interview for this story. 
It’s not entirely clear when the refuge will release its final Bison and Elk Management Plan, although its website says this fall. The current plan dates to 2007, and mostly hasn’t worked to achieve one of its major goals: reducing elk feeding by 50%. It’s also unclear how much the “preferred alternative” in the forthcoming environmental impact statement will differ from the “Alternative D” assessed by USGS. 
“They’ve changed multiple times already,” Cross said. “I don’t know if conversations are ongoing or not.” 
There are elements of “Alternative D” that the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has supported, said Brad Hovinga, who supervises the agency’s Jackson Region. 
“We were definitely supportive of continued feeding of bison,” Hovinga said.
There are still ongoing discussions about chronic wasting disease thresholds that could idle alfalfa trucks on the National Elk Refuge, Hovinga said. Game and Fish in a general sense will be pushing for an option that’s “more in line” with its state-level feedground management plan, he said. 
“That’s been our goal all along,” Hovinga said. 
Wyoming’s first-ever feedground plan, completed in 2024, does not compel reform or call for closing any feedgrounds, though it allows for halting feeding so long as consensus is reached with traditionally pro-feeding parties, like ranchers and hunting outfitters. 
The chronic wasting disease threshold for stopping elk feeding included in the recent analysis was not chosen arbitrarily, Cross said. The threshold was based on 2016 research. That study concluded that animals gathered on the National Elk Refuge will be pushed into a state of population decline once CWD prevalence in cows reaches 7%.

(Photo by Taylor Thomas/Nishnabotna Water Defenders)The eyes of dead fish and the message “know what you drink” adorn a new billboard near Avoca that urges Iowans to monitor nitrate levels in their water. 
The billboard is the first of several that the Nishnabotna Water Defenders, a nonprofit organization advocating for water quality in southwest Iowa, plan to install. 
The group formed in March 2025, a year after a couple hundred thousand gallons of fertilizer polluted the East Nishnabotna River and resulted in more than 750,000 dead fish. 
Terry Langan, co-president of the organization, said the purpose of the billboards is to inform locals of what is in their water, alert them to the free nitrate testing kits available from the Izaak Walton League of America and to key them in on other water quality issues in the region.

“We don’t want people to be poisoned; we don’t want people to have rising cancer rates,” Langan said. 
Izaak Walton League’s Nitrate Watch program equips citizens with nitrate test strips so they can test and report the levels in the streams around them. According to the citizen-scientist data, nitrate levels in the Nishnabotna rivers exceeded concentrations of 10 milligrams per liter at various points this year.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency holds that concentrations above 10 mg/L can cause adverse health effects, specifically an illness known as blue-baby syndrome, which can be fatal to infants.
Some research, however, has found that exposure at even lower levels could be linked to preterm birth and low birth weights and certain types of cancer. 
Water quality experts have said the high concentrations in the rivers this summer is linked to the heavy rains this year that followed years of drought conditions. Scientists in a comprehensive study of water quality in Polk County predicted that climate change will cause more of these weather patterns. 
The report, in correlation with a lawn watering ban in Des Moines and surrounding communities due to high nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, have generated greater awareness of nitrate pollution in the water. 
“I think a lot of people operate under the assumption that everything was cool and the water is great, and it’s not,” Langan said. “That’s becoming very well known.” 
The report from Polk County pointed to agriculture as the primary contributor to nitrate pollution in the river. Langan said Iowans are “suffering” from the “corporate capture” the agricultural industry has in Iowa. 
Scott Kovarovics, the executive director at the Izaak Walton League of America, said in a press release that nitrate pollution is a “serious” problem in Iowa, but also in other communities across the country. 
“When local groups put up billboards along the highway, you know they are not just concerned— they’re fed up,” Kovarovics said of the Nishnabotna group’s actions.
In addition to the partnership with Izaak Walton League to provide nitrate testing kits, Langan said Nishnabotna Water Defenders is working to raise funds to provide testing kits for other water pollutants that are also impacting the watershed. 
The first billboard is located on U.S. Highway 59, outside of Avoca. Jodi Reese, Nishnabota Water Defender’s secretary, said the group chose that location because it’s near the Flying J gas station that spilled petroleum into the nearby West Nishnabotna River. 
Reese said the billboard highlights the “habitat death” of these spills and gets “people to think about what they’re drinking and what’s going on with their water.” 
The group’s next billboard is slated to go up near Shenandoah, which – prior to the heavy rains this summer – had been under water conservation orders for more than a year. That billboard is also near Clarinda, where an algal bloom in the Nodaway River recently contaminated the city’s water supply.
“This level of violence against the environment is not sustainable,” Langan said. “There are universal laws that are being violated. We’re going to end up – on this trajectory – in a wasteland.” 
Langan hopes the billboards can extend beyond the Nishnabotna watershed and pop up in communities across the state. The group is hosting an event Oct. 12 in Red Oak to raise funds for additional water testing materials and the billboard initiative. 
“There’s nothing more ubiquitous than water,” Langan said. “There’s nothing more sacred to us and more of a necessity – it literally runs through our bodies and through our neighborhoods.”

The Taiwan Feed Industry committed to purchasing 8.5 million metric tons of corn and corn products, while the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers Association will purchase 6.5 metric tons of soybeans.
“Today’s announcement is great news for Arkansas and especially our row crop farmers, who need all the assistance they can get right now,” Sanders said in the release.
Between 2025 and 2029, the Taiwanese groups will purchase agricultural products worth at least $5.56 billion from Arkansas and other American suppliers, the release said. Final prices will be negotiated by the importers themselves, the governor said, making it unclear how much would actually be paid.
Arkansans paying millions more in tariff costs compared to 2024

The announcement comes at a particularly precarious time for one of Arkansas’ largest industries, which is facing its worst period in years as a result of depressed crop commodity prices compounded by less-than-ideal weather and tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.
Some state agriculture experts, such as the Agriculture Council of Arkansas and Democratic Senate hopeful and farmer Hallie Shoffner, are warning of impending disaster if more isn’t done to help farms — a third of which could shutter by next year without assistance, according to reporting from Talk Business and Politics. Farmer and GOP state Sen. Blake Johnson of Corning, has also said he believes 20-30% of farmers could close their doors by year’s end without help.
Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman, who chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, has said he is working to get federal relief money for the state’s farmers.
Taiwan is already one of the largest markets for American and Arkansas agricultural products, according to Sanders’ release. Arkansas exported roughly $63.2 million to the country in 2024.

The joint effort from the Wildlife and Fisheries, Health and Environmental Quality departments began Thursday, according to a LDEQ news release. Officials are collecting samples from various locations and analyzing them for heavy metals – such as arsenic, chromium, barium and lead – and petroleum-related hydrocarbons. Control samples of the same species will also be collected from Bayou Lacombe, an unaffected waterway. 
Results from Thursday’s testing are expected to take about two weeks, the agency said. A second round will follow in 60 days, with more testing planned if required to confirm whether the fish, shrimp and crabs are accumulating any toxins. 
The health department and partner agencies will use the results to assess any potential public health risks and determine if seafood consumption advisories are warranted.
Cleanup and decontamination efforts continue in Tangipahoa Parish nearly a month after petrochemical storage tanks exploded at the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland and caused a fire that burned for about two weeks. The company processes and sells oils, lubricants, fluids and acids for various industrial and automotive applications.  
The explosion dispersed an oily residue onto neighboring homes, businesses and a nearby elementary school, while petrochemicals spilled into area waterways. An oil slick was visible on the surface of the Tangipahoa River, stretching roughly 45 miles south of the facility, LDEQ documents show.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published by the Valley News on Sept. 18.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — After recent testing showed lower levels of toxic fumes in the air, the Hartford School Board has voted to reopen 12 classrooms that Hartford High School had discontinued using.
In June, air quality tests showed high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, better known as PCBs, in classrooms located in the high school’s B wing. Two of the 12 classrooms that were tested showed that the level of PCBs exceeded the “immediate action level” for occupation, as defined by state law.
Despite not being tested, the 10 other classrooms were closed, because they fit a similar profile to the two that exceeded the “immediate action level,” according to the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation. They were built with similar types of construction materials known to contain PCBs, including caulk.


PCBs were banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979 because they can cause damage to the body’s nervous, immune, reproductive and endocrine systems, among other health effects. In 2021, the state Legislature passed Act 74, which mandated testing in response to concerns about the legacy of toxic chemicals.

The affected rooms had previously been designated to be at the “school action level,” where students and educators are allowed to use the space, albeit for a limited amount of time each day.
The decision at Wednesday night’s meeting was based on results from testing in the classrooms at the start of the school year.
Hartford School District Director of Facilities Jonathan Garthwaite reported that all of the classrooms that were retested had lower levels of PCBs in the air than they did in June.
“We’ve had higher concentrations in the air” when there are higher humidity levels and temperatures, Garthwaite said during the School Board meeting.
“I think it is safe to say we can expect that trend to continue,” he said. “We have higher readings when it’s warmer and we have lower readings when it’s cooler.”
School Board member Kevin “Coach” Christie, who participated in the meeting remotely, asked Garthwaite how much control the district’s HVAC system has of keeping temperatures in classrooms at levels necessary to minimize the amount of PCBs in the air.
“Frankly … nobody knows what (the temperature) is,” Garthwaite said. “We know there’s a correlation between temperature, relative humidity and airborne concentration, but it’s a correlation.”
The high school is running its ventilation systems “as hard as we can,” he said. “We can’t do anymore.”
The high school does not have an air conditioning system, he added.
With the loss of 12 classrooms, Hartford School District administrators moved educators to different spaces. While they made it work, it was not ideal, Hartford High School Principal Nelson Fogg said during Wednesday night’s meeting. Teacher and student advisory groups had to share space.
There are also 21 teachers teaching who are forced to change classrooms throughout the day, which can impinge on instructional time.
“Our staff are getting to their rooms just as or after students are,” Fogg said. “Our teachers are telling us they’ve struggled to build a classroom community as they move from space to space.”
Before voting, School Board member Cathy Lemire asked Fogg if any staff members had approached him with concerns about reoccupying the 12 classrooms.
“Our staff has not suggested in any way that they’re concerned about moving back into them,” Fogg said. “I would suggest quite the opposite.”
Foil tape installed as a remediation measure over PCB containing building materials by the State of Vermont in Hartford Area Career and Technology Center’s Health Sciences has made no improvement in the levels of the chemicals found through routine testing, said the school district’s Director of Facilities Jonathan Garthwaite in White River Junction on Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025.

The $6.4 million shooting range, which is open to the public, is the largest skeet and trap range in the state, said Tom Mullikin, director of the Department of Natural Resources, during a Friday ribbon cutting.
State officials put $750,000 into building the range, which has been under construction since 2022. Federal funds from the Wildlife Restoration Program, which is meant to preserve and manage wild animals, made up the remaining $5.7 million, according to the natural resources department.
The Boyd Foundation, a Columbia-based nonprofit, chipped in another $200,000 for equipment, according to the department.
The 780-acre range will be open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. Every 30 clay pigeons a person shoots will cost $5, according to the department.
The shooting range, about 25 miles south of Columbia, is meant to be a space for new shooters to learn the sport, for longtime marksmen to practice their skills, and for educational groups to take lessons, Mullikin said.
The nearby Wateree Shooting Range will transition to offering only sporting clays, making the new range the only one of the seven state-operated shooting ranges to offer skeet and trap shooting.
The new State Skeet and Trap Facility is also large enough to host the state’s skeet shooting tournament. High schoolers will use it for competitions, while middle schoolers will compete at Wateree.

Around 760 students across the state participate in the Department of Natural Resources’ Scholastic Clay Target Sports program, which culminates in championship tournaments, according to the agency.
Ten years ago, Maj. Billy Downer, who oversees the department’s staff operations, visited the property for a hunt with other veterans and military families.
While firing on the shooting range of what was then private property, he asked Michael Love, whose family had owned the property for years, “What are you going to do with this place?”
“I don’t know,” Love replied.
The two started brainstorming, and Love decided he wanted to see the property become a publicly owned shooting range, Downer said. The state bought the land the next year.
The Love family’s legacy will live on as part of the shooting range’s name, Downer said.
“I hope and pray we’re going to share that legacy with thousands of young people and other people in South Carolina that can enjoy this place,” Downer said.

Safety and community are foremost goals at the state’s shooting ranges, Mullikin said. He envisions the range as a place where parents can bring their children to learn the basics of handling and shooting guns. More experienced hunters will be able to give pointers to people who are just starting out, Mullikin said.
Trained range safety officers will monitor the eight fields, and a classroom will allow staff to teach 4H clubs, women’s hunting groups and any other organizations interested in learning the proper and safe way to handle guns, Mullikin said.
“We’ll create a culture where safety is normal, mentorship is normal, and stewardship is a standard,” Mullikin said.
For children, especially, the range represents a way of getting outdoors and finding a hobby not involving screens, said Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette.
The state’s public ranges are generally cheaper than private ranges, according to the natural resources department.
For example, the National Wild Turkey Federation charges $60 for 100 clays at its shooting facility in Edgefield.
“We need to get our kids out of the house and away from video games and putting their phones down and getting back to fishing and hunting and shooting,” Evette said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The University of Florida rescinded a retired professor’s emeritus status Friday, the university announced, over a Facebook post the evening of Charlie Kirk’s death that garnered social media backlash.
The university posted to social media Friday that “a retired faculty member who issued a post on social media that is raising concerns” had lost emeritus status. In a followup, the university did not confirm to the Phoenix who the professor was. The Gainesville Sun reported that it had confirmed the professor in question is retired UF law professor Jeffrey Harrison.
The professor, on his public Facebook profile, posted the night of the day Kirk was killed:
“There is a lot of commentary about Charlie Kirk. It’s not that complicated. He was a evil person spounting [sic] all kinds of hateful messages. I did not want him to die. I reserve that wish for Trump. But let’s face it, even members of the Gestapo and guards at the concentration camps had children. That does not make them heros [sic], nor does it make Charlie Kirk someone to be admired,” he continued.
The post was still up at the time the Phoenix started writing this story; however, before the story published and after a reporter messaged Harrison requesting an interview, his profile disappeared.
Scott Presler, a conservative activist with 2.3 million followers on X, posted to that social media platform Thursday calling for the professor to “lose any affiliation w/ UF & any current duties.”
Thursday, Harrison posted, “I am  getting a lot of hateful commentary about a recent post in which I did not want Charlie Kirk to die but it would be fine with me if Trump did. The latter sentiment i have seen on Facebook scores of times. This avalanche of hate came after someone reposted my original post on X. This leads me to ask if X has gone over, even more than Facebook, to Trumpers?” This post, too, is no longer publicly available.

According to UF regulations, the emeritus title is “conferred in recognition of meritorious service, and it shall entail continued campus courtesies … including parking, use of the library and recreation facilities, admission to athletics and cultural events, receipt of such publications as are sent to regular faculty members and members of the Alumni Association, participation in contract and grant endeavors, and participation in academic convocations.”
The retired professor is no longer listed on the Levin College of Law list of emeritus faculty.
Harrison wrote in The Gainesville Sun a guest column in 2022 that criticized UF administrators who “cowered” to Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Teachers among those answering to employers after Charlie Kirk social media posts

The rescinded emeritus status follows warnings from Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas and State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues promising accountability for educators “celebrating or excusing campus violence.”
The University of Miami, Florida Atlantic University, and now UF have been subject of attention regarding professors’ social media posts since Kirk’s death.
Various K-12 teachers have been under investigation, too, as the Phoenix previously reported.
Friday, Miami-Dade public schools confirmed to the Phoenix that it has received five allegations against employees for inappropriate conduct on social media or in the classroom related to Kirk’s death. Those allegations are under investigation, the district said.

Amber Herzmann, 44, who worked at hospitals in Clinton and West Des Moines, recently reached a settlement agreement on disciplinary charges brought by the Iowa Board of Nursing.
According to the board, Herzmann was working at an Iowa hospital in early 2024 when it was reported that she was stealing medications, including Oxycodone and fentanyl, from multiple patients.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Herzmann was criminally charged with nine felony counts of prohibited acts involving controlled substances and one count of tampering with records. Prosecutors, who allege she stole the medications from maternity patients at Clinton’s Mercy Hospital, recently agreed to a plea deal, although court records provide conflicting information as to the specifics.
Herzmann’s signed plea deal indicates she has pleaded guilty to a single count of tampering with records, while the court order related to that plea suggests she has pleaded guilty to one count each of tampering with records and prohibited acts. She is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 2, 2025.
That case is one of two pending criminal matters involving Herzmann. Twenty days before the criminal charges were filed in the Clinton County case, Herzmann was charged in Dallas County with 13 counts of felony prohibited acts and 13 counts of tampering with records. In that case, police allege that Herzmann, while working on the maternity floor at UnityPoint Health’s Methodist West Hospital in West Des Moines, stole fentanyl belonging to numerous patients.
Methodist West later reported a loss of 14 vials of fentanyl and two syringes of hydromorphone, classifying the loss as a potential theft, according to state records.
Dallas County prosecutors recently agreed to a plea deal in which Herzmann has pleaded guilty to two counts each of felony prohibited acts and tampering with records. She is expected to be sentenced on Oct. 3, 2025, one day after her sentencing in the Clinton County case.
In 2024, the Board of Nursing filed disciplinary charges against Herzmann as a result of the Dallas County thefts, but settled the matter in March of this year by requiring Herzmann to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, which assists nurses with substance abuse issues.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Herzmann, who now lives in Erie, Ill., for comment.

Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) being removed from his House Appropriations Committee post after he voted against the bill. July 24, 2025 | Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAs Michigan budget negotiations between the Republican-led House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate continue with 12 days left until a government shutdown, the heads of several state agencies are speaking out, warning that cuts within the House’s $78.5 billion proposal could severely impact their operations.
Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity Director Susan Corbin was among the latest to criticize the House’s budget, noting the proposal slashes 47% from the department’s current budget. 
“These drastic cuts to budget and staffing will create a ripple effect across Michigan’s economy and the programs people depend on.” Corbin said in a statement on Thursday. “Reductions in resources mean fewer protections and safety nets, fewer jobs, and fewer opportunities for hardworking Michiganders.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Corbin pointed to several potential impacts from the cuts in funding, including a loss of $130 million in federal spending authority for the unemployment insurance agency. She also warned of severe cuts to Michigan’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration and drastic reductions in funding for both Michigan Rehabilitation Services and the Bureau of Services for Blind Persons.
“In a time of national economic uncertainty brought on by federal tariffs, these cuts would not only cause immediate job losses, but they would also create long-term economic harm for families and businesses across the state,” Corbin said.
Col. James F. Grady II, director of the Michigan Department of State Police, said the $40.2 million in budget cuts and the equivalent of  297.5 full time positions for post operations.
In a statement, Grady said the cuts would leave the department without sufficient funding to run trooper recruit schools and would require them to examine ways to reduce spending, including cutting trooper overtime, implementing vehicle and mileage restrictions and enacting potential layoffs from the trooper recruit school that will graduate in November.
Grady also pointed to the end of funding for the Secure Cities Partnership, eliminating trooper assignment to high-crime areas, and dedicated crime data analytics and aviation support to cities around the state experiencing violent crime.
“At a time when law enforcement needs more support in terms of personnel and training, this budget takes a major step backward in defunding these priorities,” Grady said. “As budget negotiations continue, I hope they will reconsider their position and make public safety a priority.”
In addition to the state police’s concerns, Elizabeth Hertel, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said the $4.95 billion in proposed cuts would drastically affect their ability to protect the health, safety and security of Michigan families. 
With the House budget eliminating more than 1,600 full time equivalent positions in the department, Hertel said the proposal would lead to fewer child protective services workers investigating abuse and neglect complaints, fewer disease specialists responding to public health threats and fewer staffers investigating fraud, waste and abuse.
David Q. Worthams, the chair of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission warned that if the House’s budget becomes law, its staff would be cut by more than half, bringing back long delays and major backlogs in investigating civil rights complaints.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

Phil Roos, the director of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said the proposal is “simply irresponsible,” and would undermine EGLE’s ability to protect the state from pollution and potentially prompting the termination of critical public health and safety roles in areas like drinking water inspection, air quality permitting and contaminated site cleanup.
Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Director Tim Boring said the proposal slashes the department’s total budget by a third, including significant cuts to food safety work, emergency response and preparedness and customer service operations.
“At a time when our federal partners are pushing for state governments to pick up the load, the House budget plan defunds our basic functions that help Michigan farmers continue operations, keep Michiganders safe from illness, and more,” Boring said.   
Despite heavy criticism, state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, defended the House budget. 
“State department heads rushed out statements to protect the bureaucracies they run while House Republicans are standing with taxpayers,” Bollin said in a statement “Our priorities are simple and unambiguous: strengthen classrooms for every child, keep our communities safe, and fix Michigan roads. This budget stops funding failed programs and layers of bureaucracy that do not deliver results and returns those dollars to visible priorities that improve everyday life.”
However members of the Michigan Democratic Party have already begun targeting Republicans in vulnerable districts across the state over proposed cuts to police and health care. 
“Republicans in Lansing have again failed to stand up for the communities they represent,” House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said in a statement. “Through this door-to-door program, we’ll hold these lawmakers accountable and make sure every voter in their district knows where they stand – and it’s to kick Michiganders off their healthcare and defund the Michigan State Police.”
In addition to a door knocking campaign, the party has already begun running ads against state Reps. Jamie Thompson (R-Brownstown), Rylee Linting (R-Grosse Ile Township), Steve Frisbie (R-Battle Creek), Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson), Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills), Ron Robinson (R-Utica), Nancy DeBoer (R-Holland) Timmy Beson (R-Bay City) and Karl Bohnak (R-Deerton).

But Nevada is ineligible for the relief because the state already turned over the personal data to the feds. 
The other 21 states “offered declarations from their respective agency officials, who explain that having SNAP funds withheld is likely to require them to cut staffing and otherwise greatly reduce their ability to comply with their obligations under the SNAP Act to administer benefits, including, for example, the speed with which applications can be reviewed and required reports can be prepared,” the court’s ruling said.
“No such declaration, however, was filed by any official on behalf of the State of Nevada.”
As a result the “State of Nevada, as of August 12, 2025, had fully complied with the USDA’s request for SNAP data,” says the order issued Thursday by the Northern District of California. The motion from the attorneys general was filed on July 28.
More than 505,000 Nevadans, about 15% of the population, received SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, in 2024. The Trump administration says it intends to use the data to crack down on and investigate alleged fraud. 
But the effort raises concerns that agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement could use the information against individuals it seeks to deport.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo did not respond to questions about the state’s decision to turn over the data, or whether he was aware Ford, who is challenging Lombardo for governor, intended to fight the effort. Ford’s office also did not respond.
The Division of Social Services official who oversees SNAP was out of the office Friday.
In March, Trump issued an executive order titled “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,” and ordered each state to provide SNAP applicant and recipient data, “including but not limited to personally identifiable information in the form of names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers.”
SNAP is a state-administered, federally-funded program that provides billions of dollars in food assistance to tens of millions of low-income families. Personal information is provided to state and federal administrators in order to receive assistance, with an understanding that the information will only be used for SNAP purposes.
The data request places states in the position of breaching their agreement with recipients and applicants by providing the personal data or risking the loss of federal funding for the critical assistance.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1287472642-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 17:58:55.602074

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The U.S. secretary of Transportation is raising concerns about the state’s use of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs to select contractors for the Francis Scott Key Bridge replacement, saying such programs are potentially unconstitutional.
In a letter to state officials Thursday, Secretary Sean Duffy wrote that he has a “specific concern” over whether the state “intends to award contracts for the FSK Bridge project in a manner that relies on the race or sex of contractors.”
“Any reliance on race- or sex-conscious factors in contracting decisions could introduce significant legal vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in the management of the project,” Duffy wrote, adding that the administration believes “race- and sex-based ‘presumptions’ of disadvantage” in its own Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program are “unconstitutional.”
“As outlined in my ‘Follow the Law‘ letter of April 25, 2025, addressed to all recipients of DOT funding, the Equal Protection principles of the U.S. Constitution prohibit State and Federal governmental entities from discriminating on the basis of protected characteristics, including race and sex,” Duffy wrote. “Discrimination based on race is, has been, and will continue to be unlawful, except in rare circumstances.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D), in a statement, did not directly address Duffy’s remarks about race- and sex-conscious factors but instead answered his concerns about the “overall cost and schedule for completion” of the bridge. Initial projections from the state said it expects the Key Bridge to reopen in 2028 at a cost of $1.8 billion.
Loss of Key Bridge leads to more potholes, truck traffic in neighborhoods

“We will continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster,” Moore said in his statement. “We anticipate the price estimation process to be finalized in the coming months and we will provide regular updates from the Maryland Department of Transportation about the project’s status.
“In the meantime, we will continue to pursue litigation and make substantial financial contributions by way of advance construction costs and insurance settlement dollars to keep the project moving,” he said.
Moore concluded by saying safety and “the sound stewardship of taxpayer dollars remain our top priority as we work to fully restore economic vitality—not only to the Port of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, but for the people across the country.”
Nine of Maryland’s 10 federal legislators noted that the federal commitment to covering the costs of the bridge replacement is set in law.
“The Key Bridge was bigger than Baltimore and Maryland – its collapse took away a vital transportation artery for the broader region and a gateway to the Port of Baltimore,” the lawmakers, all Democrats, wrote in a brief statement. “As we have with other major infrastructure disasters with nationwide implications, Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to provide the full resources necessary for reconstruction to ensure it can be rebuilt as quickly and efficiently as possible.
The lawmakers said they would work with federal transportation officials to “keep delivering on this national priority and commitment.”
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the state’s sole Republican member of Congress and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, did not sign the letter.
In April, Duffy warned states that they could lose federal transportation funding for failing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts or if they continued to use DEI policies.
“It shouldn’t be controversial – enforce our immigration rules, end anti-American DEI policies, and protect free speech,” Duffy wrote in that April letter. “These values reflect the priorities of the American people, and I will take action to ensure compliance.”

In June, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction against the federal policy. Maryland was part of a coalition of nearly two dozen states that sued to block the effort.
Maryland officials continue to press forward with a plan to remove the remains of the bridge that collapsed after a massive cargo ship struck a bridge support. The March 26, 2024, incident killed six people working on the bridge, stymied cargo vessels moving in and out of the Port of Baltimore and cut off a vital transportation artery carrying Interstate 695 over the Patapsco River.
Congress, under then President Joe Biden, approved a plan to cover 100% of the costs. Initial state estimates have placed those costs at around $1.8 billion.
“As you know, it is a high priority of the Trump Administration to build big beautiful new roads and bridges that enable people and products to move faster and more efficiently, thereby supporting economic growth and prosperity for America,” Duffy wrote in his Thursday letter to Maryland officials. “We want the replacement of the FSK Bridge to be a model of how to build quickly and cost effectively.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9617-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

John Sauer argued that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has the authority to revoke extended protections initially granted to Venezuelans under the Biden administration. Those protections extended Temporary Protected Status to one group of Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2023 and another who came in 2021. “The new order again displaces the Secretary's judgment on a matter committed to her unreviewable discretion by law, again impedes important immigration enforcement policies, and again ties up the Secretary's actions in protracted litigation that will effectively nullify them absent relief from this Court,” Sauer wrote. Former President Joe Biden granted TPS holders from Venezuela protections until October 2026. TPS is granted when a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, political instability or extreme natural disasters. The Trump administration has moved to end TPS status for several groups, including Venezuelans. The status protects immigrants from deportation and grants work permits.This is the second time in this legal battle the Trump administration is appealing to the high court to let it end protections for Venezuelans. In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to temporarily terminate TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans but the case continued in lower courts.",,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

Ned Lamont’s veto of a major housing bill, his phone pinged with messages from lawmakers who wanted him to sign the measure — including some who voted against House Bill 5002.
The text messages, obtained by The Connecticut Mirror through an open records request, show how affordable housing has become a political quagmire for the state’s Democrats. Lawmakers who voted for and against the bill told the CT Mirror there were some who voted no for political reasons, even though they agreed with what it did. 
Some took a risk and voted yes, although it may not play well in their districts. And Lamont, weighing a third term, vetoed it after prolonged concerns about the messaging from opponents and advice on how signing the bill would resonate in wealthy Fairfield County towns. 
Lamont seemed to know his decision to veto was making few in his party happy.
“Lots of Democratic legislative [sic] is very angry, may take a walk around the park in a few hours,” Lamont texted an ally on June 23, just a couple of hours after he vetoed House Bill 5002.
The bill was the most significant piece of housing legislation to cross the governor’s desk since he took office in 2019. It aimed to improve the affordability and accessibility of housing and tackled issues like zoning, transit-oriented development, parking, homelessness and fair rent commissions.
The text messages also confirm previous reporting by the CT Mirror showing that Lamont sought counsel in the days leading up to his veto. The messages include questions from Lamont to Fairfield County advisors about how the housing bill would play politically.
“I wanted to text you to encourage you to run for a third term!,” Steven Sheinberg, chair of the Fairfield Democratic Town Committee, texted the governor.
“On 5002. My download for you is that it is a net negative politically to you. For Democrats, too, especially in our county. It is our biggest weakness here,” Sheinberg continued. 
In a statement to CT Mirror, Sheinberg said the governor should convene a blue ribbon panel to come up with recommendations on what to do about the housing crisis.
Lamont also asked Mark Boughton, the commissioner of the Department of Revenue Services and former longtime mayor of Danbury, what he thought about the housing bill for Danbury and the rest of Fairfield County.
“I don’t want to lose those towns …,” Boughton responded, mentioning towns like Ridgefield. “Our brand of being a moderate compassionate leader is a winning formula.” He then suggested a veto followed by a special session.
Reached by phone, Boughton declined to comment further.
“Although the Governor consulted current and former local elected leaders from both sides of the aisle on the housing bill, electoral politics did not play a role in the Governor’s decision on the original housing bill,” Lamont’s spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement. 
‘Difficult seats’
The bill passed with narrow margins — 84-67 in the House, and 20-15 in the Senate in May. To overturn a veto, each chamber has to approve a measure with a two-thirds vote, which would mean 101 votes in the House and 24 in the Senate.
Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, was among those who voted against the bill but later texted Lamont asking him to sign.
“Hey Governor, would you be willing to connect about the Housing bill?,” Leeper wrote on June 7. “As someone who voted no, I actually hope that you won’t veto it.”
Leeper said in a written statement that she wanted him to sign it, then have the legislature come back in special session to make changes. She also had concerns about the parking and assigned number of housing units.
Lamont and other state officials have expressed concerns about misinformation around the bill, and Lamont privately mentioned frustration about the group CT169Strong’s characterization of the bill. One of the group’s founders said previously that they “stand by everything we’ve said about what’s in the bill.”
“I shared with the Governor the same thing that I shared with my constituents, that a lot of what this bill aimed to achieve was mischaracterized and grounded in misinformation,” Leeper wrote in a statement to CT Mirror. “I believed there was a better way to fix this bill, rather than the long drawn out veto process.”
On June 6, Rep. Anne Hughes, D-Easton, texted the governor about the economic boon to Fairfield County that the housing bill could unlock. Hughes, who voted in favor of the bill, was attending an event on the economy with several other representatives and a member of the governor’s staff.
“We are so proud to stand up with you in signing this culmination of years of work in closing the economic and racial disparity in our state,” Hughes wrote. “We are all with you!”
She went on to list some of the people she was referencing, including Rep. Sarah Keitt, D-Fairfield, and Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport. Both of those legislators had voted against the bill.
Hughes said in an interview that the lawmakers talked at the event and agreed Lamont should sign the measure.
“We fully expected him to sign it because we had negotiated with his office a robust bill,”  Hughes said. “There were some members of our caucus that were for it, but in potentially difficult seats, so they didn’t vote for it.”
Keitt said in an interview that federal legislation has since changed the landscape of what a family can afford in Connecticut, and that the bill is needed now more than it was before.
“I have my personal opinions,” she said of her no vote. “I also have to weigh what my constituents want, and my constituents, at the time, didn’t support the bill.”
She said she believes “the numbers are different now,” and that people in her district may not be able to afford their housing in a few months.
“That calculation has changed for me, as well as the fact that we’ve made compromises to the housing bill,” she said.
In an interview, Steinberg said he was not in favor of the bill and that Hughes “doesn’t speak for me.” He supports affordable housing and wants to see legislation he can vote for, he added.
“I’ve always been a moderate and as you’re probably aware, despite my stated desire to pass better affordable housing legislation, I’ve actually been one of the leaders defeating some of the bad stuff in recent years,” Steinberg said.
Blanchard, Lamont’s spokesperson, said in a statement that lawmakers have to balance the needs of their constituents with finding solutions to big problems.
“Many lawmakers may have opposed the bill based on concerns from their constituents but philosophically supported the approach and goals of the legislation,” Blanchard said. “Everyone can agree that we need to build more housing to meet demand, to lower housing costs and to provide shelter to the homeless, while also looking at different ways to achieve these goals.”
Lamont said when he announced the veto that he wanted to see legislation that got more local leadership on board. He had particular concerns with measures that would eliminate minimum off-street parking requirements for smaller apartment complexes and another that would require towns to plan and zone for a set number of units of housing.
The governor’s office has been in negotiations with legislative leadership for the past several weeks working on a new version of the bill. Officials hope to have a special session sometime next month.
“The Governor continues to meet and collaborate with legislative leaders, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as COST and CCM on finalizing a new draft of the housing bill,” said Blanchard, in a statement. “Addressing our housing needs in a way that builds on our state’s investment in housing, while also encouraging towns to join our efforts, has always been a priority for Governor Lamont.”
Democratic leaders in the House and Senate said they were aware some of their colleagues liked the legislation and voted against it.
“I think there are a variety of reasons why people vote no if they know that their vote isn’t necessary for it to pass,” said Planning and Development Committee co-chair Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon.
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said housing can be a tough political issue.
“Certainly there are political considerations when people are taking votes on bills, particularly around housing and zoning issues,” Rojas said. “But that doesn’t always necessarily mean that they don’t support the policy or want to see action be taken on it.”
‘A big chance’
On the flip side, lawmakers said, there were some who are in difficult districts for zoning reform, which typically include small towns or suburbs, who took a risk and voted for the bill.
“I hope that the gov doesn’t veto it since things do need to change, and a lot of us took a big chance and voted for it,” said Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, said in a text message to Lamont’s chief of staff ahead of the veto.
Welander said her district is complicated because there are four towns that all have very different needs. Part of her district includes Woodbridge, which has been subject to a lawsuit over its zoning practices for affordable housing.
“I had really hoped that this bill, 5002 would go through, because we had been assured that it would be signed by the governor, that a lot of us had been spent a lot of time and effort, either working on it, or, in my case, just going through it line by line, and learning as much as I could to ensure that I could vote on it in a way that wasn’t going to harm my towns,” Welander said in an interview.
Blanchard said in a statement that Welander is a “champion for her district,” and that the governor has worked with Democrats to achieve many things including tax cuts, investments in education and housing and reform to the child care system that aims to provide free care for some families. He also said Lamont did not take into consideration lawmakers’ reelection odds when making his decision. 
Many of those who took the risk, like Welander, are now left feeling politically vulnerable because of the veto, lawmakers said.
“They were anxious about voting for it,” said Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London. “It was the morally correct thing to do, and then to have the governor veto it after they did the right thing, they were upset.”
Rep. Robin Comey, D-Branford, messaged the governor’s chief of staff Matthew Brokman on June 10.
“I’ll be very disappointed if the governor vetoes the housing bill,” Comey wrote. “I’m standing strong behind my vote and to have him veto would be devastating.”
Hughes said she gets backlash from her district over housing, but stands behind her vote.
“I always say to especially my freshman colleagues and people in difficult districts, ‘Defend your votes, explain it and educate your constituency,’” she said.
She and other lawmakers said the veto will make it difficult to trust Lamont’s office in future negotiations.
“It was the team, playing, working really well with each other, and he chose not to be part of the team,” Marx said.
“How can we go forward when now it has signaled to the opposition that all you’ve got to do is get people to call the governor’s office, certainly key people that he listens to, and he’ll veto it?” Hughes said. “It’s very, very difficult to move forward in good faith.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

Kevin Stitt's State of the State Address on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A panel has recommended all Oklahoma judges get a 17.58% salary hike.
If approved by lawmakers, the proposed hike recommended Tuesday by the Board of Judicial Compensation would mean the Oklahoma Supreme Court chief justice would earn $233,062 a year while district judges would make $197,189. 
Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman, who serves as president of the Oklahoma Judges Association, said the cost will be about $10 million. 
The state has 277 trial and appellate judges, Balkman said.
In a letter to state leaders, Ty Tyler, Board on Judicial Compensation chair, said the increase would make Oklahoma judicial salaries equivalent to the regional average.
Oklahoma ranks 45th in judicial pay, the letter said.
“It was the agreement of the board that the role of our judiciary is becoming even more important and to draw qualified candidates we needed to be competitive with the region,” said Lauren Brookey, a board member. 
The board meets to make recommendations for judicial compensation  every two years. Any change requires legislative approval.
The Board of Judicial Compensation in 2023 recommended a 17% hike in judicial salaries, Balkman said. 
In 2024, the Legislature approved a 7% hike for district judges. The following year, lawmakers approved a 7% hike for appellate court judges, Balkman said.
Oklahoma’s 27 district attorneys salaries are tied to the salaries of district judges, Balkman said. The $10 million does not include an increase for prosecutors, he said.
Statewide elected officials’ salaries were also once tied to judicial salaries, but they were decoupled about a decade ago.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson signed onto a letter released Friday that urges college leaders to defend free speech and “say no to the ‘Assassin’s Veto.’”
The letter led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird cautions college officials against stifling free speech and debate in the name of protecting it through unfair or disproportionate security measures and costs.
“Particularly at this moment, it is critical our state institutions of higher learning serve as forums for robust debate from all perspectives,” Bird wrote in the letter addressed to “presidents and deans of universities and colleges.” “The campus should be the very place where the First Amendment rings loudest for all to hear.”
It follows the Iowa Board of Regents directing public universities to quickly investigate and censure, up to job termination, employees alleged to have posted comments celebrating the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In South Carolina, an opinion by Wilson cleared the way for college officials to fire employees for their posts.
Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University as he debated with students at an outside event.
“The tragedy of Charlie Kirk’s assassination is a sobering reminder that the right to free speech must be protected,” Bird said in a press release on the letter. “Charlie was murdered while debating on a university campus, a place where the free exchange of ideas should be encouraged; we cannot allow the actions of an assassin to stop free speech in any way. Colleges and universities must take steps to keep their students safe while preserving free discussion and open debate.”
Citing 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, the letter stated that requiring “exorbitant” security fees for certain groups or events based on the content or viewpoint expressed by the speech can go against the First Amendment.
The letter cited the University of New Mexico’s attempt in 2023 to impose security fees totaling more than $5,000 on Turning Point USA — co-founded by Kirk — for an event that October hosted by the organization featuring former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines, an outspoken opponent of transgender women competing in women’s sports. A judge issued a preliminary injunction against the college for the fees, the letter stated.
University security policies must be transparent and nondiscriminatory, the letter stated, and security fees must be decided upon in a “content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral manner.” Facility use policies should follow these rules as well, and ensuring the safety of eventgoers and participants should be handled by the institution rather than act as a barrier for certain types of speech, it added.
If universities advertise themselves as being open for public speech and debate, placing more scrutiny and fees on conservative speakers and events — or refusing to host them altogether — while not doing the same for politically neutral or liberal speakers could also violate state Consumer Fraud Acts or Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws, the letter stated.
“Universities shouldn’t shut down free speech on campus because of potential danger but should be encouraging civil discourse and condemning political violence at all levels. I believe that’s what Charlie would have wanted, and it’s what I want as well,” Wilson wrote in a release about the letter.
Clemson fires 2 professors, Coastal Carolina fires 1 employee over social media posts

He signed on days after publicly releasing a letter to Clemson University President James Clements making clear that colleges in South Carolina could fire employees over their social media posts about Kirk’s death without risking prosecution. A South Carolina law dating to 1950 makes it illegal to “discharge a citizen from employment or occupation” because of their “political opinions or the exercise of political rights and privileges guaranteed to every citizen.”
While Wilson guaranteed in his letter Monday that the state wouldn’t pursue charges for terminating employees for social media posts he called “vile and incendiary,” he noted fired workers could still sue if they believe their free speech rights were violated.
At least four employees of South Carolina public colleges have been fired since Monday for posts about Kirk, including three at Clemson and one at Coastal Carolina.
In Bird’s letter, the attorneys general pledged to “fully and fairly investigate” colleges in their state for any complaint about unfair security fees or protocols.
Beyond Wilson, the 15 other attorneys general signing onto Bird’s letter are from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah.
“We trust that you will continue to take steps to keep your campuses safe,” the letter stated. “And we also trust that you won’t use safety as a pretext to silence debate, at a time when it is sorely needed.”

“Strengthening connections with local partners is a priority for Luther College, and we are excited by how this new partnership with the Decorah Community School District will deepen the relationship between our two organizations,” said Luther College President Brad Chamberlain in the release. “The partnership reflects a mutual commitment to invest in our local community by improving opportunities for students from Decorah to access and afford a Luther education.”
In order to qualify for preferred admission, the release stated Decorah High School students must remain in good standing with the district, have a minimum 3.25 grade-point average and complete Algebra II by the end of their junior year of high school.
In addition to institutional scholarships they may receive, students going down the preferred admission path will be eligible for the institution’s $500 Preferred Admission award.
Decorah high school students are “among the best in the nation,” Matthew Beatty, Luther College vice president for enrollment management, said in the release, and graduates who have chosen Luther to continue their education have thrived there.
Decorah Community School District Superintendent Tim Cronin said in the release the partnership is a new way of supporting students and their future goals.
“Many Decorah High School students already excel in academics, the arts and athletics, and this agreement provides them with the opportunity to continue their education at Luther while remaining connected to the community that has fostered their growth,” Cronin said in the release.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 20:42:48+00:00,CT Mirror,"As government shutdown looms, CT Dems push for ACA subsidies",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/ct-democrats-government-shutdown/,"Despite a looming federal shutdown, Democrats are insisting that any short-term funding bill must address health care priorities.","Congress is in a stalemate over federal funding after a series of failed votes on Friday to keep the government open and avoid a shutdown. 
But Democrats, including Connecticut’s senators and representatives, aren’t backing off their insistence that any short-term funding bill must address health care priorities such as extending subsidies that would prevent sharp increases in insurance premiums.
The path forward is unclear, and the time crunch makes it more complicated. Congress is out of town all next week, and the House won’t return for votes until after the Sept. 30 deadline. The House originally had votes scheduled two days before the deadline, but GOP leadership cancelled them on Friday.If neither side budges, that raises the prospect of a shutdown.
Lawmakers in both chambers took the first steps on Friday to pass a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, to keep government agencies running at current levels for a specific amount of time. A short-term deal buys them more time to negotiate a full-year spending package for fiscal year 2026.
The House first passed a bill to keep the government running through Nov. 21. It passed mostly along party lines, but because Republicans narrowly control the House and only needed a simple majority, they didn’t need to rely on Democratic votes. Only two Republicans opposed it, and one Democrat backed the GOP proposal. All five Democratic members of Connecticut’s House delegation voted against it.
But the bill failed once it made it to the Senate, along with a competing measure from Democrats. The Democratic version extended funding through Oct. 31 and included similar provisions, such as more funds for lawmaker security. But Democrats added a host of health care measures that have been nonstarters for Republicans.
In the Senate, Republicans need votes from at least seven Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance a bill. All but one Democrat opposed the GOP continuing resolution, and both of Connecticut’s senators voted no.
Even with the short window, lawmakers have more time to strike a deal. But in the event they can’t figure it out in the next two weeks, Congress could be heading toward a shutdown —the first since a partial shutdown that started late December 2018 and lasted about a month into January 2019, during President Donald Trump’s first term.
In the event of a shutdown, essential functions and services would continue, including the intelligence community and other national security agencies. The most immediate consequences would be furloughs of federal employees who work for various government agencies. Some workers, however, would be exempt, such as the military and most air traffic controllers. But they wouldn’t get paid during a shutdown and would receive back pay once government operations resumed.
The longer a shutdown lasts, the more it could interrupt other key services. Connecticut’s senators warned of risks to veterans’ affairs facilities, as well as Head Start child care centers, that might not be deemed essential, as they were in the past.
But given an already-diminished federal workforce, a shutdown this year brings new risks, including the slowdown of important grants to some programs and services.
“It’s not just the checks going out — someone has to approve the checks, release the grant money,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in an interview. “We’re in uncharted territory with so many of these agencies already hollowed out, so a shutdown could be a tipping point.”
Both parties are already pointing fingers. Republicans say they offered Democrats a “clean” extension of government funding for the next seven weeks. They called Democrats’ plan an “unserious” proposal with a hefty price tag.
“The kind of clean CR Republicans have put forward used to be something Democrats embraced. In fact, Democrats voted in favor of clean CRs no fewer than 13 times during the Biden administration,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said. He called Democrats’ alternative a “fundamentally unserious proposal designed to appease Democrats’ liberal base.”
Democrats counter that the GOP won’t engage with them in bipartisan negotiations to keep the government running.
They are trying to exert the rare leverage they have in funding talks, with their main priority focused on extending Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, undoing health care provisions in the “big beautiful bill” including Medicaid cuts, and reining in the Trump administration from clawing back funding that Congress already approved.
Their version of a continuing resolution was crafted in part by U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, who serves as the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., argued that having some guardrails in place for how the White House freezes or pulls back approved federal funding is especially important for Connecticut. He pointed to the administration’s decision to halt the state’s offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, which is 80% completed.
“We just want the president to obey the law. We don’t want insurance rates for people to go up, and unfortunately, Republicans are unwilling to stand up for families all across this country here and see insurance premiums go up and to stand up for the Constitution and rule of law,” Murphy told reporters on a call with Blumenthal after the Senate voted on the dueling government funding bills.
Republicans have resisted including the expiring subsidies in the bill and believe they can be addressed later in separate legislation. Democrats argue there’s an urgency to get it done now, particularly with open enrollment in the state-based exchanges beginning on Nov. 1.
“For everybody who is thinking, ‘Well, can’t they wait?’ No, we cannot wait to do these measures,” Blumenthal said on the call with reporters. “It is imperative that we act now. There is an urgency to people who are going to be sick, who need surgeries, who are undergoing treatment, and their health care insurance will be unaffordable to them because the premium tax credits will end or they will be off Medicaid.”
If the subsidies expire at the end of the year, states would have to pick up the costs. For Connecticut, officials could spend more than $295 million a year, according to a spokesperson with Access Health CT.
That prompted Gov. Ned Lamont and governors from 17 other states to call on congressional leaders to extend federal subsidies that help more people afford health coverage through state-based marketplaces. 
Nationally, if the subsidies expire at the end of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projects that more than 4 million people would lose health care coverage over the next decade, citing increases in out-of-pocket expenses because of more costly premiums. Connecticut residents who get insurance through the state health care exchange could pay an average of $1,700 more a year.
The expiration of enhanced tax credits will lead to out-of-pocket premiums for ACA marketplace enrollees increasing by an average of more than 75%. Insurers expect healthier enrollees would drop their coverage and cause premiums to then go up, according to a Peterson-KFF analysis.
If the government shuts down on Oct. 1, it’s unclear how long it would last and what negotiations between the parties would look like.
“I don’t know. It’s obviously very worrying that [Republicans] are not negotiating now,” Murphy said. “And I worry that Donald Trump has just decided that he’s not going to talk to Democrats. He’s going to use the White House to try to politically punish Democrats.”
Blumenthal echoed the sentiment that any talks could be at the whims of the president. “He could decide the day after the shutdown that he wants to negotiate and do what’s right for the country.”

The document said further that the system had to be “highly portable” as well as reliable, and would need the capability to notify Arkansas Capitol Police to an emergency from anywhere on the Capitol grounds, as well as the location where the system was triggered.
Samantha Boyd, Jester’s spokesperson, told the Advocate the motivation was “political violence just in general.” The system would be used by both Capitol staff and lawmakers.
“Schools are doing this too, so we thought it was time for us to kind of join in on that,” Boyd added.
Boyd said Jester’s office is negotiating with Centegix, which creates similar systems for governments and schools.

Boyd said while a timeline was being worked out as part of the negotiations, the goal was to have a system delivered as soon as possible.

Kirk was fatally shot Sept. 10 while speaking at a college campus in Utah. The House resolution came as President Donald Trump and his administration have sought to crack down on anti-Kirk rhetoric.


Here is how members of the Colorado delegation to the U.S. House voted on the resolution “Honoring the life and legacy of Charles ‘Charlie’ James Kirk“:

Jason Crow (D): Yes
Diana DeGette (D): Present

Jeff Hurd (R): Yes

Pettersen supports language in the resolution that condemns violence, but she “could not vote in favor of the partisan language” also included in the resolution, she said. She and other Democrats introduced a separate resolution “condemning all forms of political violence and rejecting rhetoric that dehumanizes or demonizes political opponents.” It highlighted the June assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, among other acts of political violence in recent years, including the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
“Instead of bringing us together to heal and stand together, unfortunately, Speaker Johnson was willing to play partisan games that continue to divide us,” Pettersen said in a statement, referring to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson. “It is truly unimaginable that in this moment of tragedy, these cynical tactics were prioritized over the leadership that is so desperately needed right now in our country.”










“I went to war three times for this country to defend the Constitution and the rights of people to say things I may disagree with ... The right of every American to speak freely, peacefully organize, and protest is fundamental to who we are. After all, what is more American than the ability to question authority?


– U.S. Rep. Jason Crow


Crow voted in favor of the resolution a day after he gave a floor speech in the House condemning political violence and highlighting the importance of free speech. He said Trump, who blamed “the radical left” for Kirk’s death, is attacking the rights of those who disagree with him. 
“I went to war three times for this country to defend the Constitution and the rights of people to say things I may disagree with,” Crow, a former Army Ranger, said in his speech. “The right of every American to speak freely, peacefully organize, and protest is fundamental to who we are. After all, what is more American than the ability to question authority? Questioning authority is, in fact, our foundation and how we came about as a nation.”
DeGette said Congress “cannot condemn political violence only when it happens to one party,” adding that she supports the Democrat-led resolution condemning political violence because it “denounces all forms of political violence, regardless of the victim’s political affiliation.”
“However, I cannot vote yes on this resolution because it grossly misrepresents Charlie Kirk’s methods, views, and beliefs while citing Christian nationalist language,” DeGette said in a statement. “I will always condemn heinous acts of violence, but this resolution ignores the false and hateful rhetoric that was too often present in his debates.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham and state lawmakers don’t agree to put medical health care worker compacts onto the agenda of the Oct. 1 special legislative session.
Under such compacts, participating states accept medical workers professionally licensed in other states, thus expanding the work force.
On Monday, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services opened applications for states to apply for the $50 billion federal Rural Health Transformation Program, authorized by the so-called “big beautiful bill.”  According to guidelines released earlier this week for the fund by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, applicants who participate in interstate compacts for nurses, doctors, psychologists, emergency medical personnel and physician assistants will be given preference for rural hospital funding.
Hospital advocates, state officials navigating federal funding ‘uncertainty’

New Mexico is a member of just one interstate compact agreement — for nurses — and is one of only four states that participate in one or fewer compacts. Earlier this year, lawmakers passed seven compact agreements out of the state House with broad bipartisan support, and said they hoped doing so would address the worker shortage impacting patients and care across the state. All of the bills, however, stalled in the state Senate.
The federal agency will close initial applications for the Rural Health Transformation Fund on Nov. 5, leaving little time for lawmakers to approve New Mexico’s participation, according to Think New Mexico Executive Director Fred Nathan, whose organization previously lobbied for the medical compact legislation, and identified them as a key element of addressing the state’s health care worker shortages.
Choosing to bump the issue to the January session would put New Mexico at a disadvantage and possibly forfeit federal funds, he told Source NM.
“Legislative leaders have an opportunity to maximize federal support for New Mexico’s rural hospitals by working with the governor to include the health care worker compacts on the agenda for the Oct. 1 special session ” Nathan said.
Republican lawmakers have said they wanted to include health worker compacts as part of the agenda for the special session in a letter to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier this week.

Robert Down, left, moderated. (Screenshot courtesy Notre Dame University)
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, shared a stage Friday to reflect on their friendship and bipartisan approach to governance, one they said they hope will serve as an example to a nation reeling from the assassination of rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk.
The pair spoke on stage at Notre Dame University for a talk titled “Pragmatism over Polarization,” which the university’s president, Rev. Robert Dowd, moderated. He asked both governors to offer their perspectives on political violence, polarization and bucking their own parties for the common good. 
As leader of the state that became the global epicenter of political violence last week, Cox has given news conferences viewed around the world since Kirk’s death. He’s used the news conferences to both update the public about the arrest of and allegations against suspect Tyler Robinson, but also to call for calm and disagreement without violence.
He reiterated that message Friday, saying “disagreeing better” is increasingly vital in a polarized nation under threat of political violence. 
“We can’t solve any of the greatest problems affecting our country if we all hate each other,” he said. 
Bomb threats target homes of state Democratic Senate and House leaders Wirth and Szczepanski

Lujan Grisham lamented the state of politics, which she said has coarsened to the point where violence or threats of violence are commonplace. Late last week, bomb threats against New Mexico Democratic legislative leaders  prompted the brief closure of a school and Santa Fe City Hall. 
“I don’t think there’s any elected official in America that hasn’t had a threat of violence or an absolute death threat made against them,” she said.
Cox and Lujan Grisham pointed to their friendship and working relationship as members of the Western Governor’s Association, which convened earlier this year in Santa Fe. Cox took over the helm of the organization from Lujan Grisham in Santa Fe. 
He pointed to the governors’ shared work on housing affordability last year as proof that respectful disagreement in politics is possible and worthwhile.
“We’re in this room, all these governors talking about it,” he said. “ And I truly wish every American could watch that, because you would be unable to tell who were the Republicans and who were the Democrats in that room, because this is a problem they were trying to solve together.”
Both said turning down the temperature despite the high stakes of politics requires deeper listening and debate that begins with mutual respect. Lujan Grisham said she would try to be better about that during his last year in office.
“Talk to someone who has different views than you do,” she said. “Listen to them. Be open minded, try to understand. I have not done enough of that in my political career, and so I’m dedicated to making time and room for more of that.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-19-at-11.15.33-AM-1024x574.png,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

The Iowa Board of Nursing recently charged nurse Christopher Bourbon, 40, of West Des Moines, with unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public, habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs or alcohol, and violating a contract with the Iowa Professional Health Program.
According to the board, Bourbon entered the program, which helps nurses with substance-abuse and alcohol issues, in October 2023. In November 2024, the program allegedly  reported “significant noncompliance” with the program by Bourbon.
The board alleges Bourbon failed to provide breathalyzer tests on multiple occasions in September and October 2024, failed to provide signed releases for his worksite monitor, and failed to arrange for a required evaluation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the board, Bourbon was “informed by phone and in writing to stop practicing nursing” in October 2024, although GPS tracking showed that he was at his place of employment in early November 2024.
The board alleges that while working at an unspecified health clinic from August 2023 until July 2024, Bourbon was suspected of practicing nursing while impaired. According to the board, Bourbon was the only medical provider working at the clinic on the morning of July 15, 2024, when he appeared disheveled, unable to focus, and was alternately crying and “giggly.”
According to the board, “video surveillance footage showed (Bourbon) wobbling around” in the clinic and two patients he cared for that day later raised concerns about whether they had received the correct medication given Bourbon’s condition.
Another patient identified Bourbon’s behavior as abnormal and had Bourbon lock the doors and close the clinic, the board alleges. When the clinic owner arrived later that day, an open bottle of champagne was allegedly found in the clinic refrigerator.
To resolve the case, Bourbon recently agreed to a 12-month suspension of his nursing license and agreed to submit to a substance abuse evaluation. If his license is reinstated after 12 months, it will be placed on probationary status for two years and he will required to submit to chemical screening.
On Aug. 29, 2025, Bourbon was arrested and charged with second-offense drunken driving. He has yet to enter a plea in the case.
Home health nurse charged
In a separate matter, the Board of Nursing recently charged Tera Serbousek, 46, of Cedar Rapids, with practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or illicit drugs, or while impaired by the use of legitimately prescribed medications.
According to the board, Serbousek was employed by a home care agency called To The Rescue from October 2024 to December 2024. In November 2024, she allegedly showed up at a patient’s residence while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
According to the board, Serbousek was job-shadowing another nurse at the time. Serbousek allegedly passed out or fell asleep and an ambulance was summoned when the other nurse was unable to wake her.
Serbousek was allegedly admitted to the hospital and released the next day. She allegedly admitted to the agency staff that she had been drinking heavily the night before her shift. Board records indicate Serbousek was allowed to maintain her employment with the agency and in December 2024, a staff member at To The Rescue contacted her superiors to report concerns that Serbousek was again inebriated at work.
At the time, Serbousek was alleged to be speaking slowly, unable to remember her laptop password, and unable to recall how to complete medical charts. A subsequent test revealed the presence of alcohol in her system, the board alleges.
To settle the case, Serbousek recently agreed to a one-year suspension of her nursing license.
On Aug. 28, 2025, Serbousek was convicted of first-offense drunken driving, a charge that stemmed from a March 24, 2025, arrest in Linn County.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderATLANTA — The top vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Friday to change long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed.  
If approved by CDC leaders, the recommendations will also place a new emphasis on the risks of COVID-19 immunizations, despite the agency’s own data demonstrating that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people.
CDC vaccine panel votes to limit use of a childhood vaccine as COVID, hepatitis B decisions loom

The panel, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a wide range of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. Several states —including Georgia, where the CDC is headquartered — have codified the committee’s recommendations into law, allowing the panel to play a key role in determining which vaccines are covered by insurance companies and how accessible immunizations are for the general public.
Though the panel did not withdraw an existing CDC recommendation that individuals between the ages of six months and 64 years get vaccinated, it does require “an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination is most favorable for individuals who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and lowest for individuals who are not at increased risk.” For adults ages 65 and older, vaccine recommendations will be “based on individual decision-making.”
COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Americans is currently much lower than that of other immunizations, such as the flu shot. Only 13% of U.S. children were up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines as of April, according to Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, who serves as the acting chief medical officer for CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Among adults ages 65 and older, that number hovers around 43%.
The CDC’s own data showed that COVID-19 vaccines reduced serious disease and emergency department visits among both children and adults. But during Friday’s meeting, some ACIP officials questioned — without evidence — whether COVID-19 vaccines provide any advantage to the people who chose to get them.
“What is the true efficacy and true benefits that these vaccines provide?” said Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Dr. Robert Malone, a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is also a biochemist who has previously said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise.” Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder.
Robert Malone, an ACIP member and biochemist who has previously said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise,” also pushed back on data showing that COVD-19 vaccines provide protection for the general public.
“There is no established correlative protection for COVID, period, full stop, and stop saying otherwise,” he said in a tense exchange with a fellow committee member.
Other public health officials criticized the proposed rule change that would have required patients to obtain a prescription before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
“If we start asking for prescriptions for vaccines, which are again, a primary prevention public health strategy, we are going to overwhelm physicians’ offices,” said Dr. Amy Middleman, who serves as a liaison member on behalf of the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. “It’s alarming to me that for a primary preventive strategy, we are actually adding access concerns and barriers, rather than diminishing them.”
The committee also signaled that it would be open to revising current CDC recommendations that advise all pregnant Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Current guidelines state that mRNA vaccines are safe and effective for those who are pregnant, and can help provide immunity to babies under six months of age, who are too young to get vaccinated.
But Levi, who delivered a presentation that centered on the risks of COVID-19 vaccines, argued that current guidelines do not fully underscore the risk of adverse effects from vaccines.
“We decided not to bring it to a vote today, but we do hope that the FDA and the CDC will look much more carefully into this,” he said. “Most of us are extremely concerned about the safety and the lack of robust evidence for not only pregnant women, but their babies.”

Kennedy Jr.’s new vaccine advisers added confusion Friday to this fall’s COVID-19 vaccinations — declining to recommend them for anyone and leaving the choice up to those who want a shot.
Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year’s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.
In a series of votes, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn’t specifically recommend vaccination but said people could make individual decisions.
The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around the supposed risks of vaccination, an idea that received pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record.
And the divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.
Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics called the decision not to recommend vaccination “extraordinarily vague” and said it would have “real-time impacts on American children.”
He said the discussion involved clear efforts to “sow distrust” about vaccines.
“It was a very, very strange meeting,” O’Leary said.
The COVID-19 vaccines are not perfect, but CDC data shows they provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected. Likewise, people can get COVID-19 repeatedly as the virus continues to evolve.
Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots now are being updated yearly, but only about 44% of seniors and 13% of children were up-to-date on the coronavirus vaccinations last year, the CDC said.
“If you make a recommendation that people are simply not going to follow, I don’t think that’s wise,” said panelist Dr. Cody Meissner of Dartmouth College.
Another question concerns a very rare side effect mostly in young men — a kind of heart inflammation called myocarditis — that was discovered in the early days of vaccination in 2021. A scientist studying whether people with certain genes are uniquely susceptible to that risk told the panel the Trump administration had canceled his grant before the research could be finished.
The panel took up COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus remains a public health threat. CDC data released in June shows the virus resulted in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations last fall and winter. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and young children — especially those who were unvaccinated.
Worried about access, leading medical groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics already have issued recommendations that the vaccines be available to anyone age 6 months and older who wants one — including pregnant women — just like in prior years.
Several states have announced policies to try to assure that access regardless of Friday’s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America’s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continuing covering the shots through 2026.
The panel opened the second day of its meeting with continued confusion over a question it left hanging Thursday: whether to end a longstanding CDC recommendation that all newborns be vaccinated at birth against a liver virus, hepatitis B.
[RELATED: RFK, Jr.’s advisory panel recommends new restrictions on MMRV vaccines]
The panel had been considering whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination — something doctors and parents already can choose to do. But amid criticism from independent pediatric and infectious disease specialists who say the vaccine is safe and has helped infant infections drop sharply, the advisers decided Friday to postpone that decision.
On Thursday, the panel recommended a new restriction on another childhood vaccine.
They recommended that for children under 4, their first dose of protection against MMR — measles, mumps and rubella — and chickenpox should be in separate shots, not a combination version known as MMRV. Since 2009, the CDC has said it prefers separate shots for initial doses of those vaccines and 85% of toddlers already do.
On Friday, the committee also recommended that the government’s Vaccines for Children program — which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids — align its guidance with that narrower MMRV usage.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25261599128177-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority announced Thursday that marshlands in Cameron Parish received $122 million in restoration dollars from Deepwater Horizon settlement funds. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Cameron Parish will receive a sizable grant to help rebuild its vanishing marshlands, state officials announced. 
The Calcasieu-Sabine Basin will get $122 million from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement for drainage improvements geared to help marsh plants grow and halt erosion. 
The basin, on trend with the entire Louisiana coastline, has experienced dramatic wetland loss, with more than 128,000 acres lost since 1932 and a projected 110,000 at risk of loss in a future without intervention, based on data from the United States Geological Survey. 
The first phase of the project, planned along the southeastern edge of Calcasieu Lake, will build seven drainage structures with elements of a levee that allow water to flow back and forth from either side. The design is meant to balance water and salinity levels between the lake and the rest of the watershed, using natural events such as low tides and cold fronts to keep the marsh from being inundated with water. 
“This funding allows us to move from planning to construction on one of our most critical restoration efforts,” Gov. Jeff Landry said Thursday in a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority news release. 
Future phases of construction include up to 18 miles of channels to improve water flow into the marsh and deposits of dredged material to promote the growth of marsh vegetation. Existing water control structures around Calcasieu Lake will also get maintenance upgrades as needed. 
Estimates of the project’s total cost come to about $260 million, according to the CPRA. A previous $28.6 million grant was put toward planning costs with any remainder to be rolled over for construction and maintenance. 
“The Calcasieu-Sabine project reflects the kind of large-scale, science-based restoration prioritized in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan,” CPRA executive director Michael Hare said.. “We’re now moving from planning to action in one of the most vulnerable areas of our coast, where this investment will make a measurable difference.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9101-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Enrollment at the University of New Orleans is down about 800 students this fall as the university deals with an ongoing fiscal crisis from a years-long enrollment slump. 
There are 5,670 students enrolled at the university this semester, UNO President Kathy Johnson said in a campuswide email  this week. The count is down about 12% from a year ago. 
“This number is lower than we’d hoped, yet understandable given the challenges we’ve experienced over the course of the past year,” Johnson said. “The future remains incredibly bright as we prepare to transition back to the LSU System with a realigned budget.” 
The decrease in enrollment at UNO has spanned two decades. The school had a student body of around 17,000 before Hurricane Katrina, with an immediate drop to around 6,000 after the storm. For several years before Johnson took over the university in 2023, university officials did not align spending with enrollment. The school faced a $30 million budget shortfall  last fiscal year and implemented a spending freeze, layoffs and staff furloughs in an attempt to make ends meet. 
The loss of students means UNO will bring in about $1 million less in revenue than anticipated, though Johnson said the university will not reduce its budget. Johnson said UNO would be “judicious” in replacing students and asked faculty and staff to refrain from purchases unless they are essentially or paid for with external funds. 
The enrollment decline comes as the school is preparing to transition back to the LSU System. The Louisiana Legislature passed a bill earlier this year to initiate the transfer, which would undo lawmakers’ decision to move the university from the LSU System to the University of Louisiana System 14 years ago. 
The first meeting of a transition committee to begin work on the transfer will be in early October, LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said. 
Lawmakers and university officials hope the transfer will have a positive impact on enrollment. Despite national trends of falling enrollment, every school in the LSU System has reported increasing, often record-breaking enrollment over the past several years.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller) Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball issued subpoenas to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services on Friday seeking information regarding an unfunded law that was passed to help kinship care families in 2024. 
This came four days after Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate dismissed Ball’s lawsuit that sought to make the cabinet implement Senate Bill 151 and cooperate with a related investigation. The law has been in limbo due to a $20 million funding dispute between the legislative and executive branches of government.
Judge dismisses suit seeking to unlock aid for Kentucky kinship care families. Now what?  

Wingate made the decision to dismiss Ball’s suit, in part, because he said the auditor had not yet exhausted her options to obtain information from the cabinet about why the state failed to implement the law. 
In his ruling, he said, “no subpoenas have been sought, (the Cabinet for Health and Family Services) has complied with many of the auditor’s requests and, finally, CHFS has asserted that the auditor ‘need only provide a name and CHFS will set up an interview just as it always has.’” 
On Friday, the auditor’s office issued subpoenas seeking:

All internal Cabinet for Health and Family Services communications and external communications to, from, among, or between the cabinet and Gov. Andy Beshear’s office, the Office of State Budget Director, the General Assembly, the Legislative Research Commission, the federal government, and “any other person or entity” about Senate Bill 151 and “its execution or the decision not to execute” it. 
All information, including but not limited to documentation and communications, about the Department for Community Based Services’ (DCBS) working budget showing actual expenditures and when, how much, for what purpose, and why any unrestricted funds became obligated in fiscal years 2025 and 2026.
A list of all DCBS programs not codified in state statute or delineated within 2024 House Bill 6 (the budget). 
And more.

In a statement Ball said “I continue fighting for Kinship caregivers and the children in their care” by issuing the subpoenas and “we look forward to their production of all documents and witnesses.”

Cooper, a Democrat who is now running for U.S. Senate, oversaw the passage of Medicaid expansion while serving as governor. He frequently touts it as one of the highlights of his eight-year administration.
“It doesn’t have anything to do with waste, fraud and abuse,” Cooper said, pushing back on Republicans’ arguments that the bill will cut trim costs and bureaucracy. “They were creating this … so they could give people tax breaks.”
His criticism of the GOP-led “big, beautiful bill” came during a roundtable focused on health care costs and Medicaid — one of his first public appearances since formally launching his bid for Senate. And Cooper criticized his Republican opponent Michael Whatley’s support of the package.
“D.C. is broken,” Cooper said. “It is absolutely chaotic and broken.”
Whatley, the former chair of the Republican National Committee, has called the bill “the embodiment of our agenda,” and said it should be a key part of Republican messaging going forward.
Cooper was joined Friday by Kody Kinsley, who served as health secretary during his administration, as well as a physician, child care business owner and mother of a child with cerebral palsy.
Kinsley described a “ticking time bomb of health care costs for individuals, right around the corner.” And Dr. Michael Baca-Atlas, a Raleigh-based family physician, said he expected that “we will lose patients” who have come to his practice under Medicaid expansion.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3632-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 15:58:33.510381

The position has been vacant since May when Marcus Thompson resigned as president less than two years into his tenure.
The state’s governing body which oversees Mississippi’s eight public universities voted Thursday during executive session at its annual retreat to select Association of Governing Board of Universities and Colleges Search, an executive headhunting firm based in Washington, D.C, to assist with naming the historically Black university’s next leader. 
The move is a departure from the IHL board’s usual pick, Academic Search, an executive firm they’ve used twice for past university president searches. 
In 2023, the board hired Academic Search for $115,000 after Thomas Hudson, Thompson’s predecessor, resigned. The board also paid the firm $85,000 for the Delta State search, which resulted in Dan Ennis. 
The firm presented a proposal that “best matched the qualifications outlined in the formal request for proposals,” a press statement from the board said. Trustees said it will iron out a formal contract with the firm in the next few days. 
In August, the board announced to the public it began its official search process three months after Thompson’s resignation. For months, alumni and supporters of the university have raised questions and called for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university.

Mikie Sherrill has for months urged her GOP rival, Jack Ciattarelli, to release his tax returns, as she has. Friday, he did.","Jack Ciattarelli speaks at a town hall in Pitman on Sept. 16, 2025. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor) Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who’s running to become New Jersey’s next governor, gave the press a peek at 13 years of his federal tax returns Friday after escalating calls for financial disclosure from his Democratic opponent in the race, Rep. Mikie Sherrill.
The returns show that Ciattarelli, 63, a former state assemblyman who started and sold two medical publishing businesses, has made almost $14.9 million in income and paid almost $4 million in federal, state and local taxes since 2012.
His most profitable year came in 2017, when he retired and sold his second medical publishing business. That year, he reported almost $7.1 million in total income, the returns show. Otherwise, his total reported annual income fluctuated between $600,946 (in 2014) and more than $1.3 million (in 2016) before he retired, and $168,433 (in 2022) and $854,966 (in 2018) after he retired, the returns show.
The returns were joint returns, filed with his ex-wife Melinda. The couple’s divorce was finalized this year. She reported little income most years, with $22,138 of total income reported in 2024, the returns show.
Ciattarelli paid an average effective tax rate of 28% per year when he was working full-time, with a high of 38% in 2016, his campaign spokespeople said.
The campaign gave reporters two hours to view but not copy a towering stack of returns at Ciattarelli’s accountant’s office in Clinton. In an accompanying press release, Ciattarelli called the disclosure “an unprecedented level of transparency for any gubernatorial candidate ever.”
“Now, it’s Mikie Sherrill’s turn,” he said in a statement, urging her to release her returns back to 2018 when she was first elected to Congress.
Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, found the timing of the disclosures noteworthy — two days before the first gubernatorial debate of the general election, with Ciattarelli and Sherrill scheduled to square off at 7 p.m. Sunday at Rider in Lawrenceville.
“It’s definitely something that I would have liked to have seen earlier in the campaign, because we have a limited amount of time to weigh this stuff out, but we got it on the eve of the first debate,” he said. “It’s pretty obvious that the goal here is to not fall under the criticism on Sunday night that he hadn’t disclosed his taxes.”
But he applauded Ciattarelli for disclosing returns back to 2012, his first full year in the New Jersey Legislature. He served in the Assembly from December 2011 until January 2018, making an annual salary in that post of $49,000.
“I think that’s a good standard, is to say: ‘You saw my finances while I was in office,’” Rasmussen said.
Ciattarelli did not release his returns when he ran for governor in 2021. Then, he ran against incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy and came close to unseating him. He also ran for the post in 2017 but lost to then-Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno in the Republican primary.
Financial disclosures are important so voters can learn the sources of candidates’ income and any conflicts of interest and go to the ballot box armed with more information about the candidates, Rasmussen said.
The details of Ciattarelli’s finances could deflate his criticism of Sherrill as a wealthy politician who cashed in on her time in Congress, Rasmussen said.
“I think it sort of levels the playing field from the public perception,” Rasmussen said. “You can’t really say that Mikie’s the millionaire here, because they both are candidates who have significant assets and significant income and significant means. I’m not going to compare income brackets, but it puts them more or less at parity. They both are candidates with significant incomes.”
Sherrill and her husband, a broker at UBS Securities, reported roughly $3.2 million in income for 2024, their tax returns say. They were billed $1.08 million in federal income tax; $279,010 in New York state income tax (UBS Securities is based in New York City); and $29,002 in New Jersey state income tax in 2024.

Board members, from left: Pamela Clancy Ammar, Neelima Parasker, Diana Mendoza, Blake Benson, Blake Flanders (board CEO), Kathy Wolfe Moore and Alysia Johnston. Board member John Dicus isn't visible. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents paused review of a proposal from Kansas State University to offer a 90 credit hour bachelor’s degree in uncrewed aircraft systems that necessitated waiver of state policy mandating 120 hours of course credit to earn an undergraduate degree.
The hesitancy resulted from questions about how approval of K-State’s plan could alter the academic landscape of the state’s system of 32 public universities, community colleges and technical colleges. On Thursday, members of the Board of Regents raised issues with how potential students and higher education institutions, as well as business and industry, might respond if Kansas amended the foundational premise of a four-year degree.
The Board of Regents agreed to convene a task force to consider development of a systemwide policy before taking up proposals to sidestep existing rules requiring a bachelor’s degree to represent at least 120 credit hours of study.
“We don’t want to stymie the process,” said Alysia Johnston, a member of the Board of Regents. “This needs a whole lot of thought and input.”
Jesse Perez Mendez, provost at K-State, said the university welcomed the opportunity to participate in the task force’s debate. He said the drone bachelor’s degree for K-State’s aviation campus in Salina had been under consideration along with reduced-credit degrees related to artificial intelligence.
“This is a little bit of a game changer overall and we need to be very cautious,” Mendez said. “What this conversation is not about? It’s not about taking a bachelor’s degree in psychology and reduce that down to three years. It’s with degrees we don’t have on the books.”
He said K-State was committed to collaborating with two-year community colleges and technical colleges on alternative degree offerings.
Board of Regents policy, but not state law, established a bachelor’s degree consist of at least 120 credit hours. Policy says 45 credits must be in upper-division courses. Kansas higher education has been under pressure to recruit students as the U.S. college-age population fell. At the same time, the cost of delivering college instruction kept escalating with inflation.
Heather Morgan, executive director of the Kansas Community College Association, said the 19 community colleges in Kansas had taken a keen interest in reform of laws or policies related to reduced-credit degrees.
She said issues to consider included retention of policy permitting community college students to transfer credits in core subject classes to a university. Supplemental degree models should respond to industry demands and tap into combined potential of the state’s higher education institutions, she said.
“One of the things we’ve been talking about is how do we use the assets we already have more efficiently and deploy expertise from a faculty perspective across all our colleges,” Morgan said.
 
Unanswered questions
Rusty Monhollon, vice president for academic affairs with the state Board of Regents, said the system had sought for the past decade to increase on-time graduation rates by reducing baccalaureate programs to 120 credit hours. The percentage of undergraduate programs in the Board of Regents system with more than 120 required credit hours decreased from 67% to 8%.
Nationally, he said, the movement to accredit reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees was deepening. In September 2024, the Higher Learning Commission, which accredits Kansas colleges and universities, released guidelines reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees.
Since March, nine U.S. colleges received HLC accreditation of alternative degrees. The list included business administration, information technology, pre-physical therapy, pre-athletic training, fashion business management, semiconductor materials and devices and applied cybersecurity.
“Proponents of these degrees claim they are affordable and match up well with workplace skills demand,” Monhollon said. “Others dismiss them, arguing industry does not recognize them and that they lack the scope and the depth of traditional bachelor’s degrees.”
He offered a range of questions that might be weighed: Would three-year degrees be valued by students, industry and in academic circles? Could reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees cheapen the value of a four-year degree? What would be cut — basic subjects or advanced classes — to shrink course requirements? What should a reduced-credit degree be called? Could Kansas run a pilot program to test supply and demand? What was the range for reduced-credit programs — 90 to 105 credit hours? How would it impact the system’s general education agreements? How should graduate school process applications from students with three-year degrees?
“Not all segments could fit into the three-year degree,” said Neelima Parasker, a member of the Board of Regents. “We have to go to industry and ask them for their feedback instead of just floating this and seeing what they do.”
 
‘Huge mistake’
Blake Benson, chairman of the Board of Regents, said he was curious if estimates could be made for how many new students would enroll in the state’s public education system if reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees were an option.
Board of Regents member Diana Mendoza said the term used to describe a reduced-credit degree was consequential. She asked if it could be referred to as a workforce specialist degree to help potential employers differentiate between three- and four-year diplomas.
Kathy Wolfe Moore, another member of the state board, said she was concerned Kansas’ higher education system could become “a bit of a slave to the employment fluctuations” in the business cycle.
“I’m quite sure this board … would have no interest in moving our system backward,” said Blake Flanders, who serves as CEO and president of the Board of Regents.
Flanders said expansion of reduced-credit degree programs in Kansas would be complex, but possible if crafted with attention to detail. The cost of eroding confidence in the value of a Kansas bachelor’s degree could be significant, he said.
“If we’re thinking  about, ‘Well, let’s just skinny down or gut that systemwide general education and get all of our savings out of those credits,’ I think, obviously, this board would believe that would be a huge mistake,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kansas-Board-of-Regents-group-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 15:58:33.510381

A set of orders issued Friday moved the case forward to the high court, which will take up an appeal from the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The court will also hear a separate appeal from Flow Water Advocates, regarding the Michigan Public Service Commission’s decision to grant a permit for the Line 5 tunnel.
Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline has long been a point of concern for Indigenous tribes and environmentalists in the Great Lakes region, namely due to the 4.5 mile segment split into a dual set of pipelines running through the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet.
With Line 5 transporting 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through the straits daily, pipeline opponents have called the 72-year-old pipeline a ticking time bomb, warning of catastrophic results should the pipelines rupture.
Enbridge identified gaps in the pipeline’s coating in 2014. The dual pipelines have also been hit by two anchor strikes since 2018 denting the pipeline in three places, damaging a support and prompting further concerns about the safety of Line 5.
The state and Enbridge later agreed that the company would replace the dual pipelines with a new segment located inside a concrete lined tunnel buried beneath the lakebed. However Line 5’s opponents have continued to call for the pipeline to be shut down, arguing the tunnel’s design carries risk for explosion, while the construction of the tunnel itself carries its own risks for environmental harm.
To move forward, Enbridge must receive permits from three agencies: the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
The Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates energy providers and energy infrastructure, approved permitting for the tunnel project in 2023. However, that decision was quickly challenged by the coalition of tribes and environmentalists.
Pipeline opponents have argued the Public Service Commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac. But the Michigan Court of Appeals ultimately upheld the regulatory body’s decision.
Carrie La Seur, the legal director for Flow Water advocates, celebrated the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the appeal.
“This is an incredibly important step forward for the protection of the Great Lakes,” La Seur said in a statement. “The public trust doctrine is a fundamental principle of Michigan law that must be considered in decisions that affect our natural resources. We are eager to argue this case and ensure that our state’s waters are protected for generations to come.”
Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle argued that, tunnel or no tunnel, Line 5 still poses a threat to the waters of the Great Lakes and the culture of tribal nations. 
“The tunnel project and the dual pipelines are just two versions of one terrible idea that threatens to destroy our clean water, our fishing, and our way of life for the sake of Canadian profits,” Gravelle said in a statement. “Our choice is not between the dual pipelines and the tunnel. Our choice is between an oil spill in the Great Lakes and a clean water future for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. We simply want government officials to consider the safest, cheapest, and most common-sense alternative: Decommission Line 5.”
Matt Helms, the spokesperson for the Michigan Public Service Commission said the body would not comment on the pending legislation. 
Enbridge did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication. 
While Enbridge received permits from EGLE in 2021, the company is awaiting a decision from the department following a required redo of its water resources permit. The tunnel project is also awaiting permitting from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with President Donald Trump’s Administration working to fast track approval.

(Photo by Kelly Winter for Utah News Dispatch)Almost all public universities advanced in the Utah Legislature’s mandated process to cut “inefficient” programs in order to direct their funding into high-demand course offerings that may lead to higher paying jobs. 
But Utah State University, which is undergoing a leadership transition and included in its original plans its intent to expand its nursing program, didn’t make the cut. 
Hooper Republican House Speaker Mike Schultz said during an interim executive appropriations meeting on Monday he had concerns about the reinvestment plans the school has presented so far as required by a 2025 law that ordered universities to cut 10% of their budget for courses and then allocate the funds to expand programs that may have waitlists.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This is the last step the universities had to go through before implementing their reinvestment plans. But USU’s plans have been deferred until a new university president presents a revised plan.
Budget bills targeting ‘underperforming’ university programs press forward

“I have a hard time understanding why we would be expanding into nursing into Utah State University. You have Weber State up there that has a fantastic program already in northern Utah,” Schultz said. “To me, it just seems duplicative and kind of goes against what we’re trying to accomplish.
According to a Utah System of Higher Education presentation, health care is the No. 1 category the public universities system as a whole has identified for its reinvestment funds. So far, plans are to allocate 32.6% of the joint reinvestment account for that area. 
Nursing was one of the study areas a legislative audit — which helped inform the new law — specifically identified as in high demand. 
But that need isn’t a fact that Schultz contested during the Monday meeting. For him, the issue was that other institutions could pick up that expansion. That, in addition to the amount of new schools and administrative roles that Utah State University proposed. 
Within the reinvestment process, Utah State University has to cut and reallocate at least $12.5 million from its current budget. In the current plan, the largest chunk of the money will go to what the school describes as “technologies and careers of the future,” which includes a new school of computing, a new chemical engineering program, an AI center and an aviation expansion.



Let us know what you think...


 


A big portion of the funds is also going to health and well-being workforce, including $1.2 million allocated to expand mental health programs, $1 million for a nursing expansion, $775,000 for a new college of health and human sciences, and $385,300 for a new doctor of physical therapy. 
With Utah State University being the state’s sole land-grant institution, Schultz said, it is “uniquely set up to be doing natural resources, and working hard on natural resources; energy, critical minerals. These are things that are so important to our economy right now, and Utah’s leading out on so many of these things already.”
Schultz was also disappointed to not see more about agriculture innovation research in the plans, he said.
Alan Smith, interim president of USU, said the university is still investing in areas like energy engineering, chemical engineering and other mining programs. Some of that investment is part of this specific initiative, but funding for them also comes from other ongoing state investment.
Last year when the university doubled its space for pre-nursing majors to 120 spots a year, they were filled immediately, Smith said.
“We’d like to expand on that, because there’s a clear, strong interest and a strong need throughout the state, and I think there’s room for multiple institutions to have strength there,” Smith said. “We welcome Weber being in that arena, the U. being in that arena, and others, because there’s a true shortage.”
Despite those concerns, the decision to defer the approval of USU’s reinvestment plans was expected, said Amanda DeRito, the university’s associate vice president for strategic communications.
At each step of the process with the Utah Board of Higher Education and other legislative panels, “approval of Utah State University’s plan was conditional on approval from our next president,” she said in a statement.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The developers of the Revolution Wind project and two attorneys general whose states were set to buy its electricity both filed lawsuits contending the same thing on the same day — that the Trump administration violated its constitutional powers in halting construction on the project — but in different venues. 
On Sept. 4, the developers took their case challenging the Aug. 22 stop work order to Washington D.C. Hours later, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong appealed to the Rhode Island federal courts to revive work on the 65-turbine project.
How many lawsuits does it take to restart Revolution Wind? More than one.

Ahead of a Monday hearing in D.C. on the developers’ lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to transfer the AGs case from Rhode Island to D.C., and consolidate the two complaints into one.
A 14-page motion filed on Wednesday in federal court in Rhode Island points to the similarities between the two lawsuits, as well as the D.C. court’s existing knowledge of the project, which has already been subject of legal complaints by the Preservation Society of Newport County and Green Oceans, a citizen-led anti-wind group based in Little Compton.
“Given the significant overlap between Revolution Wind and the States’ claims and requested relief, as well as [District of D.C.]’s existing familiarity with the Project and the issues raised in the States’ complaint, this Court should transfer this case to [the District of DC,]” Justice Department lawyers wrote. “Federal Defendants thus expeditiously move to transfer this case to D.D.C. to ensure the two cases can be litigated efficiently and to avoid inconsistent judgments on the same set of facts and issues.”
Megan Skinner, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said in an email Friday the AGs will submit a written response to the court by Oct. 1.
However, in the initial complaint filed in Rhode Island, Neronha and Tong justified the decision to file in Rhode Island, rather than D.C. because of the Ocean State’s proximity to the project. Revolution Wind sits 15 nautical miles south of Rhode Island, with the bulk of the port activity transferring workers and equipment to and from the project taking place in Rhode Island and Connecticut. More than 1,000 union laborers across both states now stand to lose the jobs they already lined up if the project does not resume. The abrupt halt to the project has also put both states’ climate change mandates in jeopardy and could cost regional ratepayers more than $500 million a year without the 704 megawatts of renewable energy the project is set to produce at its maximum.
“A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred and continues to occur within Rhode Island,” the AGs wrote. “Rhode Island is the “State nearest the place the cause of action arose.”
While the project developers have also described environmental and labor consequences in their own lawsuit, their case features much more information about the financial losses the companies will incur on their $5 billion investment — $2 million in losses a day on work and equipment contracts for every day of the pause, along with an estimated $1 billion in “breakaway costs” if the project is canceled.
Chris Raia, a spokesperson for Ørsted, the co-developer of the project, declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation.
U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy, who is presiding over the AGs case in Rhode Island, has not indicated when she will rule on the Justice Department’s request to transfer the case, according to the public court docket. The clerk’s office did not immediately respond to questions Friday.
