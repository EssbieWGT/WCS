Denise Baum was ecstatic following a 63-35 House vote on Saturday morning to move HB 848, creating the Big Sky Rail account, over to the Senate.
The Billings Democrat is carrying a bill that would, if passed, give a state appropriation to the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority for the first time. The authority would receive $2 million annually until a sunset date on June 30, 2031.
“I’m extremely excited,” Baum said Saturday morning. “This is such a truly momentous piece of legislation, building out infrastructure and just having people understand that the infrastructure is already there.”
If passed, the bill would support planning, outreach and organizational work. It would also help local governments apply for larger grants and help the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority decide which places passenger rail would stop at.
The money is not going toward large capital projects or building new railroads. 
The bill got support in the Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee hearing from the Montana Economic Developers Association, the Missoula Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO and various local elected officials from across the state.
It also had some bipartisan support on the House floor. Rep. Ed Byrne, R-Bigfork, and Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings both urged a pass on the legislation on the floor.
“When you have issues such as this that are so extremely impactful to Montanans across the state … political party lines blur,” Baum said.
The fiscal impact led to some opposition. Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka, and Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, both spoke against the legislation, with Millett bemoaning the Legislature for spending money “like a drunken sailor.”
Two routes through Montana were selected as “preferred routes” in the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study. It was a federal nod from the Federal Railroad Administration that the routes were viable.
Much of the rail lines are already in use for freight cargo, and proponents of the bill have said repeatedly passenger rail and freight can coexist. 
The money comes from a railroad tax fund, which has been looked at as a funding source for several bills this session. House Bill 103, brought by Rep. Zolnikov, would have created funding for railroad inspections and was looking to use funding from the railroad tax fund. The bill was tabled in committee and Baum said it “unfortunately” went down.
The Legislative Services Division released a letter on that bill, which included an estimate of railroad tax revenue — about $4 million per year. The money previously went to the general fund.
An amendment to House Bill 2 added some money for train inspections back into the budget.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/UP-tour-Nebraska-DBleizeffer.jpg,,,2025-04-05 14:08:04.867252
,Washington State Standard,2025-04-05 16:20:44+00:00,Washington State Standard,Emails show coordination between deputies in Idaho’s Kootenai County and immigration officials,"Rachel Spacek, InvestigateWest",,,,,https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/04/05/emails-show-coordination-between-deputies-in-idahos-kootenai-county-and-immigration-officials/,"In late January, federal immigration officials got a lead on three people in Idaho they thought, based on information shared by Kootenai County Deputy Harvey Ballman, “may be illegal.”  Not only that, but Ballman was “more than willing to send us more information in the future,” wrote one Border Patrol agent in an email, passing [&#8230;]","In late January, federal immigration officials got a lead on three people in Idaho they thought, based on information shared by Kootenai County Deputy Harvey Ballman, “may be illegal.” 
Not only that, but Ballman was “more than willing to send us more information in the future,” wrote one Border Patrol agent in an email, passing along the addresses from Ballman of the three targets of immigration enforcement weeks into President Donald Trump’s second term. 
Two of the three people were ordered to be deported, according to Matt Phelps with the Border Patrol’s Targeting and Intelligence Division. 
None had been actively committing a crime, and it’d been two years since one of the three had been arrested. 
“I want to thank you for providing the information,” Phelps wrote to Ballman. “If you or any of your LEO partners have information on individuals you have encountered or encounter in the future that you suspect may be illegally present in the US, feel free to send me that information and I will research them to determine if they are valid targets for enforcement.”
Ballman responded: “good to hear. I’ll pass on your info to the rest of our patrol division. We have lots of work for you guys.”
The emails, among a trove obtained by InvestigateWest in a public records request, provide a window into the level of coordination between federal immigration authorities and the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office in North Idaho. As the federal push to deport undocumented immigrants proceeds — and as state and local agencies take different paths on how, or whether, to assist — Kootenai County has been particularly willing to join in the deportation effort.
Sheriff Bob Norris, who represents one of the more conservative counties in a state where two-thirds of voters cast ballots for Trump, has announced that he would use all of his department’s resources to help with deportations. The county jail has taken in 72 people on immigration holds, including many arrested by the Border Patrol across in neighboring Washington, where state law prohibits using jails for immigration offenses.
Since taking office, Trump has encouraged local and state law enforcement agencies to collaborate with federal immigration agents to help with deportation efforts, and several states now have agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to assist in immigration enforcement. Norris has been eager to help, regardless of whether an undocumented person has committed a state crime. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that immigration enforcement is the sole duty of the federal government and local police may assist under federal direction. Immigration lawyers and immigrant advocates warn that close collaboration between local police and federal immigration agents could undermine the main goal of state and local law enforcement, which is to deter and solve crimes.
“If somebody is undocumented and they’ve experienced a very serious crime, or seen a very serious crime, they may not be willing to come forward about that if the reality is that they would be then reported to ICE for immigration enforcement,” said Geoffrey Heeren, law professor and director of the Immigration Litigation and Appellate Clinic at the University of Idaho. 
When asked if the fear of deportation could deter victims and witnesses of crimes from reporting them and impede law enforcement, Kootenai County Lt. Jeff Howard said “it can” and didn’t elaborate.
“We’re not going to hide people who are accused of a crime one way or another,” Howard told InvestigateWest.  
The “crime” he referred to was being present in the U.S. without authorization, a federal civil offense not typically enforced by local authorities. 
“If you’re in the country illegally,” Howard said, “we’re going to notify Border Patrol.” 
‘Idaho encourages cooperation’ 
InvestigateWest reviewed a month of emails between Kootenai County deputies and federal immigration agents to understand how communication and immigration enforcement may have changed since the election. There were 393 emails between the two agencies from Jan. 1, 2025,  to Feb. 4, 2025, that show a close level of coordination between the two agencies.
In one message, Border Patrol agents asked deputies about a man from Zimbabwe with an Idaho driver’s license in the jail. In another, a Border Patrol agent offered deputies “informal training” to look for signs of “the presence of criminal aliens” and to “provide real time feedback and record checks for possible … suspects without having to go through a lengthy process from another federal agency.” 
Edward Dean, a spokesperson for the U.S. Border Patrol’s Spokane Sector, first told InvestigateWest that the agency doesn’t typically do informal or formal training with law enforcement. After he was shown the email, he shifted his stance and said the Spokane Sector “encourages” ad hoc, informal training and intelligence sharing in ride-alongs and informal meetings. 
“Not surprised this is happening,” Alycia Moss, a Coeur d’Alene immigration attorney, said in an email after reviewing some of the correspondence. “Idaho is a state that encourages cooperation with ICE and (Border Patrol) and likely will continue to.”
The emails mostly include Border Patrol agents notifying the Kootenai County jail when they’ve arrested someone and planned to place them in the jail with an immigration hold. 
Border Patrol agents have placed 72 immigration holds on individuals in the jail since the beginning of the year. This is an increase since before Trump took office, Moss said. 
“Once Trump became president, there was a significant uptick in Border Patrol holds in the Kootenai County jail,” Moss said. “So before, you’d see maybe a couple, and now you’re seeing more like a couple handfuls.” 
Norris has focused heavily on immigration since he became Kootenai County sheriff in 2020, after retiring from the Los Angeles Police Department. In public statements, he has associated Spanish-speakers with being “illegal,” said deputies would assist in deporting any noncitizens who are in the country illegally even without criminal backgrounds and suggested they all “self-deport.” 
“Criminals and illegal aliens be aware Kootenai County is a Sanctuary County for all Law-Abiding citizens of the United States who are here legally,” Norris said in a news release in February. 
In the same statement, he said deputies and Border Patrol agents would be working “in tandem” and “in the same vehicle at times.” 
Norris also made headlines in 2023 for removing library books from a public library and refusing to return them because he thought they were “disturbing.” Most recently, he threatened to arrest a woman who was protesting inside a legislative town hall and stood by while private security dragged her out of the venue. 
The sheriff’s stance on immigrants has trickled down to his deputies, the emails show. A deputy also reached out to ICE to ask about participating in the federal 287(g) program, which is a program with ICE where local police can engage in some immigration enforcement. 
“We already cooperate with you by housing inmates, but want to become a more involved partner,” wrote Kootenai County sheriff’s Capt. Jeremy Hyle. 
Kootenai County doesn’t have any formal agreements with ICE or Border Patrol, but the sheriff’s office follows the informal guidance of the National Sheriffs’ Association. In an email to sheriffs across the country, obtained by InvestigateWest, the association wrote at the end of February that ICE had logged around 700,000 civil arrest warrants for illegal entry. 
“As a result, during everyday policing activities, your personnel may encounter someone who has an ICE administrative warrant now entered into this system,” Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs’ Association, wrote in the email.
He explained in the email that agencies without a 287(g) agreement could not arrest people on the ICE warrants themselves, but said they can detain them if they are arrested on suspicion of a state crime. If no crime is suspected, Thompson wrote that police should contact ICE and request that federal agents come arrest the person. If ICE agents can’t make it, he wrote, “your only real option is to collect as much information from the person as you can and release the person and ICE will have to try to find them through their fugitive operations.” 
Just three Idaho counties have 287(g) agreements with ICE: Gooding, Power and Owyhee counties. Only Owyhee County has an agreement under the task force model where officers can perform immigration enforcement. 
The Trump administration in January issued an executive order to encourage widespread 287(g) agreements between local law enforcement and ICE. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered all law enforcement agencies to enter the agreements. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order in February that ordered all law enforcement agencies to consider entering 287(g) agreements with ICE. He also said “to the maximum extent possible permitted by law, state agencies shall continue collaborating with ICE” to focus on deporting undocumented people “with criminal records who pose a threat to public safety.” 
In states like Idaho that encourage information sharing with federal immigration agents, it isn’t illegal to share the immigration status of a person if it comes out during investigation of a state crime, but without a 287(g) agreement, it is illegal to serve federal immigration warrants and investigate people’s immigration statuses as local law enforcement. 
“Typically, state and local officers are not supposed to be enforcing immigration law, because that’s an exclusively federal arena, with some exceptions, so if they are going out and enforcing immigration law and investigating immigration violations without a formal agreement with the federal government to do so, that would be problematic,” said Heeren, the Idaho law professor.
Howard said typically when deputies are investigating a crime, they will ask for a person’s passport or other citizenship documentation. If deputies find out they are not U.S. citizens, they will contact Border Patrol agents.
“To see if (Border Patrol has) them in their system, and if they do, and it is somebody who crossed the border and they’re not supposed to be there, then they usually come out (and arrest them),” Howard said.
‘Not the worst of the worst’
Ballman did not appear to be investigating a state crime before giving federal officials the names of the three individuals who he thought were in the country illegally. No incident report was taken, records show. Yet legal experts say that by law, there would have had to be suspicion of a state crime having been committed, since the department doesn’t have the authority to carry out immigration enforcement without a 287(g) program.
“Based on the correspondence with the deputy, it appears he saw the potential for the need for Border Patrol to get involved,” Howard said. He said he didn’t know how the individuals were contacted by Ballman and didn’t respond to questions about the legality of turning them over to the Border Patrol.
But if there was no crime being investigated, it is unclear why Ballman suspected the three people were in the country illegally. Two lawyers who reviewed the correspondence with Ballman and federal agents said it could be illegal and at least questionable based on how he came under the suspicion that the individuals were in the country illegally. 
Moss said if he knew about the people’s immigration status through a law enforcement investigation, he can share that information with federal agents, but it would be improper to obtain and share their immigration status without an investigation for a state crime. 
Heeren agreed. He said police should not be suspecting people or monitoring people based on their perceived national origin. Officers are not allowed to target people for crimes based on their race or ethnicity.
“There are also problems with police officers engaging in warrantless surveillance of people if they don’t have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed,” Heeren said. 
Across the Idaho border with Washington, unauthorized immigrants are protected by state law from being subjected to questions about their immigration statuses by local law enforcement. Washington state law prohibits state and local law officers from enforcing federal immigration law and from sharing non-publicly available personal information with federal immigration authorities in any noncriminal matter. Idaho has no such law. All local jails accept immigration detainees for ICE and Border Patrol. 
Little signed a bill March 27 that would make illegal immigration a state crime and would allow law enforcement to ask about someone’s immigration status if they were arrested for a separate crime. The law was immediately blocked by an Idaho district court judge after the ACLU of Idaho filed a lawsuit against it.
The cross-border clash in approaches stands as an example of the local impact of an expanded network of deportation efforts encouraged and created under the Trump administration.
“We’re seeing the administration rapidly laying the groundwork to expand mass deportation into many branches of government that had previously been detached from immigration functions,” said Jennyfer Mesa, executive director of Latinos en Spokane, a nonprofit dedicated to immigrant rights in Spokane. “We’re now seeing state and local authorities that are conducting immigration enforcement, and there’s more federal agents within Washington.”
On March 25, ICE arrested a longtime farmworker and union activist, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez, in Sedro-Woolley. The Seattle Times wrote that ICE hadn’t responded to questions about why he was arrested, but is a Mexican citizen and was ordered to return there. His peers told the newspaper they worried he was arrested for his activism.
“We are seeing this time and time again,” Mesa said. “It’s not the worst of the worst getting arrested. It’s workers.”

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

The legislation, brought by Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, creates a new third-party license which allows off-premises licensees the ability to utilize a delivery licensee and its drivers to deliver beer and table wine.
During a Senate hearing on Feb. 18, Zolnikov said the bill was three years in the making.
“I’m pretty confident that we have thought of every situation imaginable for alcohol delivery,” Zolnikov said during the hearing.
There are very specific stipulations for delivery in the bill and drivers will be asked to use, “identification scanning software technology or an alternative approved by the department” to verify a recipient’s age. Delivery drivers will have to go through a responsible server program, be at least 21 years of age and are not allowed to deliver to obviously intoxicated people.
Drivers cannot deliver to campuses and cannot have a felony, unless they have had their driving rights restored. They also cannot have a DUI charge in the last seven years.
Alcohol must be in a cargo area of the vehicle and out of the reach of the driver. There’s even a stipulation for bicycle delivery.
“I don’t know if there’ll be many deliveries by bicycle,” Zolnikov said in the Senate hearing, “But I like to know that all of our bases are covered, just in case. Maybe in Missoula.”
The delivery industry celebrated the legislation.
“By signing this bill, Governor Gianforte is putting local business, delivery workers, and customers first,” said Anna Powell, a senior manager for DoorDash in a statement. “We are pleased to see that beer and wine delivery will soon be available via Montana grocery stores, and we look forward to offering safe and responsible delivery throughout the state.” 
In statistics provided by DoorDash, the number of U.S. merchants selling alcohol on the app increased by 37% over the course of 2023. Drivers earned, on average, nearly 20% more on deliveries with alcohol compared with deliveries without, according to the company.
“Across America, we’ve seen that safe alcohol delivery opens opportunities for businesses and delivery drivers to thrive, and consumers to have more choices at their fingertips,” Powell said in a statement. “This new law will make life easier for consumers and offer merchants and drivers a greater opportunity to thrive.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Budweiser-Beer-Montana-scaled-e1743826193191-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-04-05 12:24:57.371499

(John Gray/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Owners and operators of independent restaurants are bracing for the impact that new tariffs will have on their businesses.
This week, President Donald Trump announced new “reciprocal tariffs” for specific U.S. trade partners and a universal 10% tariff on other foreign goods.
The universal 10% tariff will take effect Saturday. The individualized, reciprocal tariffs take effect Wednesday.
Businesses buying goods from suppliers expect to take on the higher costs of importing them. For restaurants that buy a lot of food products cultivated in foreign countries, the cost of the tariffs will be noticeable.
“Our backs are really against the wall right now. We don’t really want to raise prices. But if we had to in order to stay in business, we would be forced into doing it,” said Paul Rotner, CEO of Acme Oyster House.
Prior to Trump’s unveiling of the new tariffs Wednesday, the National Restaurant Association had predicted an estimated 30% profit loss for independent restaurant owners in the country.
“Applying new tariffs at this scale will create change and disruption that restaurant operators will have to navigate to keep their restaurants open,” said association CEO Michelle Korsmo in a Wednesday statement.
Most notably, China was hit with a 34% tariff and the European Union was hit with a 20% tariff. Together, they account for 31.9% of imported goods to the U.S, according to data presented by Trump.
Though not included among countries receiving “reciprocal tariffs,” Mexico and Canada are both subject to 25% tariffs on some items. However, the tariffs only apply to goods not compliant with the USMCA, a trade agreement passed in 2020. According to a 2019 analysis of the USMCA, most agricultural products from Mexico and Canada are compliant and thus exempt from tariffs.
Acme Oyster House sources a lot of its produce from Mexico during this time of year, Rotner said. But he’s expecting the biggest financial hit to come from higher-priced kitchen equipment. In February, Trump instated a 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum.
“It’s tough. We’re pinching pennies right now and it’s going to be even harder,” Rotner said.
The restaurant industry experienced similar struggles during the COVID-19 pandemic and the inflation that followed, which drove up prices for food products, causing restaurants to make adjustments to stay afloat financially.
Now faced with rising costs again, most restaurateurs are concerned about the new tariffs, said Kristin Sparks, co-owner of Annunciation Restaurant. She said she will have to scrutinize costs further and spend extra time shopping around for suppliers offering the best prices for foreign goods.
She wants to avoid passing those costs on to customers, but is grappling with the fact that it might be necessary.
“But there’s a balance, there’s a fine line between what the consumer is willing to pay,” Sparks said. “And right now, consumer confidence is also unfortunately moving on a downward track. So, they may not want to pay those higher prices.”
And the impact goes beyond just the bottom line.
“With all of those additional costs, then you start to kind of have to pivot with menu planning, changing your menu, how might it affect what you’re serving to your guests … There’s a lot that goes into it,” Sparks said.
With different suppliers offering varying qualities of food products, operators will have to decide if they want to sacrifice food quality for a lower price.
JD Eubanks, executive chef at Tujague’s Restaurant, plans to stick with purchasing high-quality ingredients, even if it means potentially raising menu prices to recover the extra money spent on higher taxed goods.
“There’s some people that don’t really have that mindset,” Eubanks said. “They’re not going to want to buy the more responsibly sourced products, and they don’t care.”
He said it’s particularly an issue when it comes to suppliers handling animals, such as dairy cows and chickens.
“You always want to serve the best, and if you want to get the best, you have to make sure it’s good quality, humanely raised,” he said. “And to get those things it costs more money to produce, because you have to do a lot more humane practices.”
And while the restaurant always tries to buy local when possible, some of the goods needed for its French-inspired menu can’t be found in the U.S., like specific cheeses used for charcuterie boards.
“Constantly – as a restaurant owner, chef, whatever it may be – you’re shopping for the best price. And tariffs, that’s going to affect a lot of those things,” he said.

(Photo by William Meacham/Special to the SC Daily Gazette) COLUMBIA — SC Daily Gazette senior reporter Jessica Holdman took top honors for business journalism at the South Carolina Press Association’s annual awards ceremony Friday.
Her awards were among five total won by the Gazette in its inaugural year. The nonprofit news outlet competed in Division A, the category for the state’s largest daily newspapers. That means the Gazette was competing against colleagues with The Post and Courier, The State, and the Greenville News.
Holdman won the Ken Baldwin Award for Excellence in Business Journalism for all daily news outlets in South Carolina as well as first place in business beat reporting for Division A.
Reporter Skylar Laird received two Division A awards: second place in breaking news reporting and third place in education beat reporting.
And contributing columnist Paul Hyde won second place for column writing.
The annual contest awarded the state’s best in journalism — including articles, photos, columns, editorials, and page layouts — published between mid-November 2023 and mid-November 2024. For the Gazette, however, entries covered the six months since it became a press association member.
Winners of most categories were declared weeks ahead of the event. But the Ken Baldwin Award was among contests unannounced until the presentation Friday at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center.
The award, sponsored by the University of South Carolina’s journalism school, is named in memory of Kenneth W. Baldwin Jr., a USC graduate and benefactor of financial journalism education. The former business editor died in 2022 at age 96.
Contest judges said Holdman “examined business and economic development matters broadly, including their history and possible future impact.
“Her reporting covers everything from the emerging issues related to lithium battery manufacturing to the future of South Carolina’s once-dominating textile industry,” they wrote in explaining their choice. “Her work is very well done and well-researched. But most of all her stories are interesting, appealing not only to business ‘readers’ but everyone.”

The Baldwin award came with a $500 prize.
Holdman’s winning entries for her first-place business beat award included reports on emergency responders’ preparations for lithium fires, the transformation of the state’s textile industry, and a real estate developer’s lucrative leasing arrangement with the state.
Laird’s award for breaking news involved her reporting on the Medical University of South Carolina’s decision to end all gender-transition treatments — which provided answers to readers that MUSC hadn’t provided its own patients at the time and ahead of other outlets — and the scrambling of LGBTQ advocates to connect patients with care elsewhere.
Her award for education reporting involved students enrolled for state-paid K-12 scholarships in the program’s first year, parents left in limbo after the state Supreme Court declared the private tuition payments illegal, and a surprisingly high number of 3- and 4-year-olds suspended from South Carolina preschools.
In opinion writing, Hyde’s winning columns advocated closing the “Charleston loophole” as a memorial to the nine victims gunned down in a Charleston church in 2015, examined the legacy of the 1934 Bloody Thursday massacre of striking mill workers in Honea Path, and emphasized the importance of voting in state and local elections.

The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global [&#8230;]","A spawning redband trout from the Upper Klamath Basin. (Photo by Jonny Armstrong, courtesy of Oregon State University)Some already threatened cold-water fish species in the Northwest will not only face shrinking habitat from climate change but will face growing pressure from invasive fish species fleeing their own warming and dwindling waters, according to modeling from researchers at Oregon State University.
The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global Change Biology by fisheries professor Guillermo Giannico, associate fisheries professor Ivan Arismendi and graduate student Arif Jan. The three found that climate change is likely to compel all kinds of species migration that could lead to increased predation, competition and some localized extinctions of once native species in the Northwest and globally.
Giannico said their models can be run on most species in the world. But for their recent study, the three zeroed in on the northern migration of non-native smallmouth bass and northern pike into threatened and endangered native redband and bull trout habitat in the Northwest. All four of the species are likely to lose habitat as climate change accelerates and are likely to seek homes in colder water at higher elevations.
They created maps using ecological data that indicate the breadth of territory where each species lives and then modeled the impact of changing conditions such as higher temperatures and drought projected through 2070 to see how that would influence the range of all four species’ movement and overlap.
“We forecast how these species would respond to those changing conditions by disappearing from certain regions that will be too warm for them, and appearing in others that maybe today are too cold, but they would be more suitable in the future,” Giannico said. “Because not all shifts are equal, there will be areas where they will be more crowded together, and they would overlap more, and areas where they wouldn’t overlap that much.”
Of great concern is the migration of aggressive and predatory northern pike into redband and bull trout territory, and the increasing likelihood the two will overlap more frequently.
“They all shift, but they end up shifting in a way that the amount of overlap in their distribution is going to be greater,” Giannico explained. “It’s like you have less room to avoid nasty people at the party, and you end up being cornered in the same part of the room with the same people you don’t enjoy, and you’re all packed in the wrong place with the wrong companion.”










The researchers fear that this increased negative interaction could lead to local extinctions of some native salmonids, similar to those occurring among shrinking populations of bull and rainbow trout from invasive species in southeastern Alaska.



	Giannico said researchers have long separately studied how climate change will compel the migration of some species and how native species respond to the introduction of invasive species. The modeling done by the Oregon State scientists is an effort to combine the two, and to show how species’ habitats will overlap as climate change compels both native and nonnative species in an area to migrate and cohabitate.
The researchers fear that this increased negative interaction could lead to local extinctions of some native salmonids, similar to those occurring among shrinking populations of bull and rainbow trout from invasive species in southeastern Alaska, Giannico said.

Free.,"U.S. Senate GOP wins approval of sprawling budget blueprint, shipping it to the House",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-wins-approval-sprawling-budget-blueprint-shipping-it-house,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans, in the early morning hours Saturday, approved their budget resolution that will aid the party in maintaining the 2017 tax cuts but also paves the way for them to add nearly $6 trillion to the deficit under an outside analysis.The 51-48 vote sends the compromise measure to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., hopes to adopt the tax-and-spending blueprint within the next week. No Democrats backed the bill and no Democratic amendments were accepted during an overnight marathon voting session.Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul were the only two Republicans who voted against the resolution, which needed only a majority vote under the complicated process being used in the Senate.The lengthy voting session, known as the vote-a-rama, included debate on 28 amendments, with one adopted.Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan was the only member of either party to have their change agreed to, following a 51-48 vote. His amendment addressed Medicaid, which has become a flash point in the battle over the budget this year, as well as Medicare.Sullivan said his proposal would strengthen Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower-income people that House GOP lawmakers are looking at as one place to cut spending, and Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors and some people with disabilities.“We should all want to weed out waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid and Medicare, and we must keep these programs going. We should do both,” Sullivan said.Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden spoke against the amendment, saying it didn’t clearly define which “vulnerable people” would have their access to Medicare and Medicaid protected.“By not defining the vulnerable, the Sullivan amendment is code for states to cut benefits or kick people off their coverage altogether,” Wyden said. “To me, the Sullivan amendment basically says if somebody thinks you’re not poor enough, you’re not sick enough, or you’re not disabled enough, we’re not going to be there for you.”Democrats unsuccessfully offered messaging amendments dealing with everything from Social Security phone service to the minimum wage to contracts with farmers.‘Start the game’Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said during a floor speech Friday the budget resolution will clear the way for lawmakers to extend the 2017 tax cuts permanently, bolster federal spending on border security and defense, rewrite energy policy and cut spending.“The resolution opens up that process that will be done by the House and Senate authorizing committees,” Graham said. “So this doesn’t do anything other than start the game and it’s time this game started.”Wyden, ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, vehemently opposed the budget resolution, saying the tax cuts it sets up would predominantly help the wealthy.Wyden argued the tariffs that President Donald Trump has instituted would negate any potential positive impacts of the upcoming GOP tax cuts. The tariffs sent markets diving on Friday for a second day in a row.“People following along at home are going to hear a lot of sweet-sounding promises from Republicans about what they’re trying to accomplish,” Wyden said. “They claim their tax bill is just all unicorns and rainbows. They’ll say everybody is going to benefit from a tax cut and typical families will get the help they need. They’ll promise rising wages and a booming economy.“It’s just not true. The reality is, unless you’re way out at the upper end of the income scale, any benefit you get from this Republican bill is going to get blown out of the water as the Trump tariffs continue to hike inflation.”Paul said during floor debate that he was “concerned” about how his colleagues had written the measure.“What worries me is that so many things in Washington are smoke and mirrors,” Paul said. “On the one hand, it appears as if all of this great savings is happening. But on the other hand, the resolution before us will increase the debt by $5 trillion.”Paul offered an amendment that would have changed those instructions to set up a three-month debt limit extension, but it was not agreed to following a vote of 5-94.Framework for tax hikes and policy billCongress’ budget isn’t a bill but a concurrent resolution, meaning it never goes to the president for a signature. Its various provisions take effect once both chambers vote to adopt the same version.The budget resolution also doesn’t include any real money, just plans for the next decade.But it does lay the groundwork for the GOP to use the complex reconciliation process to extend the 2017 tax law, much of which was set to expire at the end of this year.Republicans plan to use that reconciliation bill to boost spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars and make changes to energy policy.The budget resolution also includes instructions to raise the debt limit by between $4 and $5 trillion later this year.The reconciliation instructions give a dozen House committees and 10 Senate committees targets for how much they can increase the deficit or how much they need to cut spending when they draft their pieces of the package.All of those panels are supposed to send their bills to the Budget committees before May 9, so they can be bundled together in one package and sent to the floor.The House GOP set a minimum of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, while Republicans in the Senate set a floor of $4 billion in funding reductions. Those vast differences foreshadow an internal GOP struggle to achieve a final deal.Nearly $6 trillion deficit increaseThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office will ultimately calculate the deficit impact of the reconciliation bill once it’s written, but several outside organizations have said they disagree with how Republicans are moving forward. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget released an analysis Friday showing the reconciliation bill would increase deficits during the next decade by nearly $6 trillion.“A $5.8 trillion deficit-increasing bill would be unprecedented,” CRFB’s analysis states. “It would add 14 times as much to the deficit than the bipartisan infrastructure law ($400 billion), more than three times as much as American Rescue Plan ($1.8 trillion), three times the 2020 CARES Act ($1.7 trillion), and nearly four times the original score of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ($1.5 trillion). In fact, it would add more to the deficit than all four of these major laws combined.”Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, wrote in a statement “the tax cuts called for in the budget plan are so expensive that deficits will rise substantially, raising economic risks associated with higher debt in service to expensive tax cuts skewed to the wealthy.”“Policymakers need to course-correct and remember their campaign pledges to help ease families’ strained budgets, not contort the budget to the desires of the very wealthy,” Parrott wrote. “That would mean crafting a budget bill that doesn’t raise families’ health and grocery costs but instead invests in making health care more affordable and expands the Child Tax Credit to support families who face challenges affording the basics. These investments and lower deficits can be achieved by a sounder tax policy that requires corporations and the wealthy — who benefit enormously from public investments — to pay their fair share.”An analysis from The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, called the GOP budget resolution a “fiscal train wreck.”Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy, and Dominik Lett, a budget and entitlement policy analyst, wrote that Republicans need to start over.“This budget isn’t just a missed opportunity; it actively worsens our nation’s debt trajectory,” they wrote. “The resolution abandons the House’s concrete spending reductions desperately needed in today’s high-debt environment, sets a dangerous precedent by adopting a so-called current policy baseline that hides the very real deficit impact of extending tax cuts, and adds hundreds of billions in new deficit spending.

(Photo: Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Following the establishment of the state reptile and amphibian last week, lawmakers took up the difficult question of whether the song “Welcome Home” by Winter Harbor resident Gordon Thomas Ward should become the official state anthem. 
Despite lyrics like “Cadillac and tourmaline, Lighthouses and LL Bean, hardest workin’ folks you’ll ever know,” senators rejected the committee recommendation to adopt the song (LD 373) by a vote of 12-17 though their colleagues in the House backed the tune 91-52. With a divided report, the issue will be back before senators next week. 
The House also saw a lengthy discussion about the preservation of Sears Island, which has been slated to be the new home of an offshore wind port (if that comes to fruition).
Gov. Janet Mills signed emergency legislation (LD 966) passed by both chambers that will allow access by state agencies and hospitals to certain confidential probate court records if the access is in the public interest.
Other votes of note:
Senators voted Tuesday to confirm D’arcy Main-Boyington for appointment to the Gambling Control Board.
Following engrossment in the Senate, the House almost unanimously passed an emergency measure (LD 466) to extend the law governing electric power and service residential rates for military veterans organizations.
Rep. Randall Greenwood (R-Wales) asked for a roll call vote for the enactment of LD 100, “An Act to Increase the Expenditure Limit for the Informal Bidding Process for the Selection of Professional, Architect and Engineer Services,” which had already passed both chambers. Greenwood argued the bill allowed the state to award contracts “to friends and neighbors without going through a formal bidding process,” to which Rep. Sue Salisbury (D-Westbrook) replied that the bill was requested by the department to “make it a more tenable process.” It was enacted by a vote of 72-68.
After several speeches on the importance of conserving the beauty and cultural significance of Sears Island, the House voted 76-68 in favor of the Energy Committee’s recommendation against LD 226, which would extend existing conservation easement protections to cover more of Sears Island, including a portion that has been reserved for development of an offshore wind port by the Maine Department of Transportation. Bill sponsor Rep. Reagan Paul requested a roll call, and encouraged her colleagues to support the bill saying it is not about offshore wind but rather about protecting Sears island. Paul said opponents of the bill had intentionally misframed its intent. 
A bill (LD 80) to establish the Seppala Siberian sleddog as the official state dog passed under the hammer.
The House on Thursday unanimously passed an amended version of LD 48 “An Act to Update References to the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Contained in the Maine Revised Statutes,” which Rep. Shelley Rudnicki explained, is done every year “to be in conformity with the federal government and make it easier for taxpayers.: 
Bills that were voted against under the hammer (without a roll call) included: LD 183, An Act to Cap Publicly Owned Land Area at No More than 50 Percent of Any County; LD 181, An Act to Modify the Calculation of Pupil Counts Used for Determination of School Administrative Unit Operating Costs; LD 927, An Act to Require Chaplains in School Administrative Units; 479, An Act to Facilitate Expansion of the State’s Recycling Efforts Under the Beverage Container Redemption Program; LD 986, An Act to Eliminate the Crime of Felony Murder; LD 223, An Act to Amend the Mining Excise Tax Laws; LD 399, An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding the Retention of Proceeds from Municipal Foreclosures; LD 565, An Act to Amend the Definition of “Homestead” Under the Homestead Property Tax Exemption Laws; LD 892, An Act to Expand Property Tax Relief for Veterans and Their Surviving Spouses, Minor Children and Parents; LD 909, An Act to Expand Property Tax Relief for Veterans and Their Survivors; LD 2, An Act to Allow Military Vehicles Purchased for Civilian Use to Be Registered and Operated on Maine Roads; LD 478, An Act to Reduce Maximum Speeds on Roads Close to Residences.

McNamara Federal Building in Detroit on Friday in defense of government employees, Social Security and the right to collective bargaining. 
Joined by U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), AFGE members stressed the importance of preserving the Social Security Administration, while warning how cuts to their agencies could impact seniors, veterans and other vulnerable Americans. 
“Federal employees are facing a threat from two entities, one entity is destroying our federal unions, and the second entity is trying to destroy our legal right to collective bargaining….We are here to tell you what that entity is doing to the federal workforce is directly harming services that we provide to our public,” said Monique Buchanan, president of AFGE Local 3239.

Following an executive order last week instructing several government agencies to end collective bargaining with federal labor unions, citing concerns of national security, the AFGE and several other unions have filed suit against the Trump administration, arguing the order violates the Constitution. 
“Collective bargaining agreements are built on agreements the union and the agency made together as a mutually agreed policy document that both union and management are to abide by. The CBA [collective bargaining agreements] allows for us to ensure all employees are treated fairly in all aspects of work. Stripping the contract or CBA will potentially cause major disruptions within our agencies, and it could affect our ability to provide services to this country,” Buchanan said. 
Additionally, efforts to cut significant amounts of staff and resources from multiple federal agencies are intended to collapse them, putting them on the path to privatization, Buchanan said. 
“Privatizing means the top 2% of this country can obtain federal contracts to take over the work of our federal agencies. Privatization will replace skilled, knowledgeable, educated, hard working employees who have been through extensive training, potentially with AI and or a replacement staff who cannot touch the world class service we provide,” she said.

Dingell spoke out against the demonization of government workers, pointing to the work they do to keep people across the nation safe. 
“The federal and government employees takes care of the veterans at all the [Department of Veterans Affairs] hospitals and make sure they get the health care they need. When I’m flying, it’s air traffic controllers that keep us safe and they aren’t recognized. They don’t have enough of them, and we need to support them, not demonize them,” Dingell said. 
She also pointed to recent mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services, calling them “terrifying.”
Dingell also detailed the history of Social Security, noting that her father in law, the late John Dingell Sr., co-sponsored the bill to create the Social Security Administration. 
“Why? Because more than half the seniors, children of people who had died and people with disabilities,were living in poverty and did not know how they were going to eat, or where they were going to live. And this country recognized that if you’ve worked hard your entire life, that you should be able to live your senior years with dignity and respect, and they created Social Security to address that problem,” she said.

While Trump pledged not to touch Social Security in proposed cuts to government spending, the president, alongside billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, have cut several thousand employees with the administration seeking to reduce its workforce by 7,000 employees.
Although the Social Security Administration was previously planning to eliminate phone services for Americans filing for benefits, The Washington Post reported the administration has since scrapped that plan, but will require individuals filing for retirement or survivor benefits or requesting direct deposit for their checks to verify their identity online or in person beginning April 14. 
“We have a moral responsibility to protect our seniors, people with disabilities and the children of those that have died and need that help. And if America cannot honor their promise to their seniors, then we need to look ourselves in the mirror and ask who we are,” Dingell said.
With the Department of Veterans Affairs aiming to cut 80,000 employees by August, Yvonne Renee Evans, a recently retired nurse at the John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, called the Trump Administration’s job cuts an attack on servicemembers, noting that 27% of VA employees and 30% of all federal employees are veterans. 
Tricia Paff, president of AFGE local 3907 who is based at the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, spoke out on proposed cuts to the EPA, noting its role is ensuring there is clean water, clean air and protecting human health and addressing climate change. 
“The Trump administration can fire scientists. They can try to remove the words climate change from EPA websites, policies, contracts, but these actions will not protect Americans from intensifying climate extremes,” Paff said, pointing to the damage from Hurricane Helene as one example.

As cuts to Social Security employees generate uncertainty for those relying on benefits, Tlaib, who is serving her fourth term in the U.S. House, said she has never seen as many people breaking down at her town halls or calling her office as she has in recent months. 
“They break your heart because they feel helpless. They’re like always on edge because they think tomorrow that check is not going to come…. I even had a veteran tell me they canceled his appointments, and now he can’t get in for another three months. Why? Because when they cut federal workforce, they’re cutting federal programs and services. People are going to wait longer. People are already feeling like they don’t matter,” she said.
Stevens shared a story of a similar call from a disabled veteran who was unsure if he would be able to continue receiving his medical benefits. 
“How is that even a question? That shouldn’t be a question for us.” she said.

While closing out the rally, AFGE National President Everett Kelley said people often don’t recognize who federal employees are. 
“Let me tell you who they are. These are the people that work at the VA that make sure that veterans are cared for every single day, and they do that job so well that nobody pays them attention. These are the people that work at the EPA that do that job so well that nobody pays them attention. Because nobody pays their attention as long as the air that we breathe is good, as long as the water that we drink is good water,” Kelley said. 
“Nobody pays any attention when they fly through the sky, because there’s a federal employee at the TSA that makes sure that we fly safely,” Kelley said. 
However, the Trump administration came for them, Kelley said, pointing to Project 2025, the conservative Heritage Foundation’s nearly 900 page blueprint for reshaping the federal government, as the warning that the Trump administration would aim to eliminate a number of federal employees. 
He also took aim at Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. 
“I say it’s the Department of Government Evil, because it’s downright evil to take American people and just destroy their well being,” Kelley said. 
As the administration continues to attack government workers, Kelley told AFGE members they need to call it like it is, pointing to comments from U.S. Judge William Alsup in his order requiring federal agencies to rehire tens of thousands of probationary federal employees that were fired by the United States Office of Personnel Management earlier this year where he called the mass firings a sham strategy to sidestep requirements for reducing the federal workforce. 
“I’m not afraid. I learned that I gotta speak truth to power. If it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to speak truth to power, and I’m here to tell this administration that we are going nowhere,” Kelley said.

March marked one year since officials first reported Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza — H5N1 — among dairy cattle. Since then, bird flu has infected 996 herds across the country, including 19 cases in the last month in California and Idaho.
New Mexico reported nine dairy herds in Curry County tested positive last April, and began milk testing its cattle in February following the rollout of a federal program.
The most recent results from milk-testing programs revealed that while more than 95% of the 93 cow herds in the state tested negative, a small set of inconsistent positives — all from three Curry County herds infected last year — remain, according to New Mexico State Veterinarian Samantha Holeck.
Enter the mystery: The cows themselves do not test positive, nor do they demonstrate the symptoms documented in the earlier avian flu outbreak, she said, such as huge drops in milk production.
“It’s been a real challenge to try to understand how it continues to circulate in some of these herds,” Holeck said.

New Mexico is partnering up with veterinarians in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research the viral fragments found in the milk and sent samples to the federal National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.
“I know we’re a year into this situation now,” Holeck said, “but it seems like there’s still just so much to try to understand.”
New Mexico isn’t alone in experiencing the viral fragments, said Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian at University of California, Davis, who noted there have been reports of similar persistent positives in quarantined herds there.
“I wouldn’t diminish the importance of it being small,” Payne said. “Yes, we’re talking about low levels of virus and yes, we’re talking about cows not getting sick, but it’s important that we’re not exactly sure where it’s coming from, and that in and of itself merits examination.”
He said more than $2 million dollars of research is being conducted in California on avian flu transmission across a dozen projects; including examining if it’s transmitted by flies; blowing in from dust storms; or carried by birds outside of waterfowl.
“It will be critical that we figure out how the disease is moving and how it’s changing,” Payne said.
 ‘Science is still very much in its infancy’

While scientists need to perform more research, Payne posited some possibilities for the detection of viral fragments: they could signify a different and less potent version of the virus; cooler weather might allow more viral fragments to survive in the bulk tanks, compared to the triple-digit temperatures in the fall; cows may have developed “herd immunity” against the virus.
“It could be that much smaller numbers of cattle are being exposed and are becoming infected, which has resulted in a much, much lower level of virus that’s being detected inside the bulk tanks,” Payne said. “It’s an area of active research.”
Veterinarian Andrew Bowman, a molecular epidemiologist at Ohio State University, said laboratory tests’ sensitivity could also be a factor: They may be picking up positives from environmental contamination in the tanks or on the farms.
“It doesn’t take much; we’re talking a few copies of the viral genome to be present in a sample to send it positive,” Bowman said. “We can pick up a positive that’s likely not a viable virus.”
Since the development of HPAI in cows is so new, as is the method of transmission — where the virus replicates in the mammary glands that produce milk — he said the basic questions of the interactions between the virus, the host and the environment still need answers.
“Science is still very much in the infancy of what we know about avian influenza in cattle,” Bowman said.
 Offering reassurances

While scientists say it’s important to unravel the mystery of the viral fragments to better understand how the virus might change or spread in dairy cows, they also emphasize that risk to the public from avian influenza remains low.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports transmission of avian flu can occur from contact with milk from infected cows; eating, drinking or inhaling droplets contaminated with live virus; touching the live or dead bodies of infected animals. Thus far, the CDC has no documented human-to-human transmission. As of April 1, 70 people had contracted H5N1, mostly California farmworkers.
Most milk sold in the U.S. is heated to a temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, called pasteurization. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested milk products in 17 states and, finding no live viruses, reported that “pasteurization is effective at inactivating H5N1, and that the commercial, pasteurized milk supply is safe.”
Federal officials, however, warn that unpasteurized milk, also called raw milk, is unsafe to drink. Research from the National Institutes of Health in June using infected raw milk from New Mexico found that the H5N1 virus had survived for at least five weeks in refrigerated conditions. Further, mice that consumed the raw milk showed signs of illness, which  researchers suggest indicates drinking raw milk can transmit the virus to other organisms.
Holeck emphasized that New Mexico milk is safe.
“For dairies, it’s standard routine if they have sick cows for any reason, not just [avian flu], that milk is always diverted out from the milk supply, it doesn’t enter commerce,” she said.

In an August meeting of the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation’s largest public power company, board member Michelle Moore reminded her colleagues of what’s written above the door of its headquarters.
“‘For the people’ … is written over TVA’s front door,” she said. “And in that spirit, I just encourage TVA to find right ways to share any proposed future rate adjustment proposals broadly, so that everyone has the opportunity to get informed, get engaged and bring their perspectives forward.”
In that meeting, Moore dissented on a vote over the company’s budget, which she said unwisely delegated decision-making authority on capital projects, including fossil fuel investments, away from the board.

Less than a year later, President Donald Trump fired Moore without publicly providing a reason, a decision revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
“L. Michelle Moore’s appointment as a member of the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors ended March 27, 2025, at the direction of the President of the United States,” the filing states.
Moore has consistently been viewed by environmentalists as the most reasonable member of TVA’s board, often dissenting from decisions that doubled down on fossil fuels. She serves as the CEO of Groundswell, a clean energy nonprofit “that builds community power by eliminating energy burdens and increasing economic opportunity with community solar, resilience centers, residential energy efficiency, and pioneering research.”
Trump’s apparent decision to fire Moore comes just a week after Tennessee’s U.S. Senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, argued for a shakeup of TVA leadership in an op-ed.
“The current TVA board focused on the diversity of its executives ahead of job creation for hungry workers in the region it is supposed to serve,” the op-ed said. “It has fallen victim to paralysis by analysis…”
Moore was nominated to serve on the TVA board by President Joe Biden in 2021.
In a statement, Stephen A. Smith, executive director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, criticized the firing.
“We’re disappointed to see President Trump’s hyper-partisan action of removing a sitting TVA board member for no reason. This action further weakens TVA’s leadership and sets into motion actions that could have significant financial impact on TVA ratepayers across the region,” he said. “As shared in SACE’s statement about the TN senators who are asking TVA to ignore a proper financial review and analysis of unproven technologies, SACE believes that it’s inappropriate for the President or the senators to try to micromanage TVA’s decisions on energy choices across the region.”
The White House has not yet responded to a request for comment on the firing.
Gaby Sarri-Tobar, senior energy justice campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, called Moore’s firing “ludicrous.”
“Trump’s firing of TVA board member Michelle Moore is ludicrous and leaves our country’s largest federal utility in a precarious position,” she said. “Ten million people rely on TVA to keep the lights on, utility bills low, and for good-paying jobs. Trump’s reckless and politically targeted move will cripple the utility’s chances to secure a safe, resilient and affordable energy future for families and workers in the Valley.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/screenshot-2025-03-21-at-11.52.26-am-1024x655.png,,,2025-04-05 09:03:33.832711

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Critics told a Senate panel Friday that a bill aimed at protecting the state from billions in potential sex abuse claims is ill-advised and being rushed through in the waning days of the legislature.
The comments came during a hearing by the Judicial Proceedings Committee on House Bill 1378, which just passed the House on Thursday and could be before the full Senate as early as Saturday. Legislative leaders are rushing to beat the final day of the 2025 session on Monday.
“This is a really, really important piece of legislation. It is terrible that it’s being handled in such a quick way at the end of the session with two people speaking,” said Tom Yost, a Baltimore attorney with clients who said they were sexually abused as children while in state custody.
Corey Stern, the other witness against the bill, said it is likely unconstitutional.
“It is well settled under Maryland law that plaintiffs have a vested right in an accrued cause of action,. whether it’s based on statute or common law,” said Stern, an attorney with Levy Konigsberg, which is representing child sexual abuse clients. “The minute that Gov. Moore signed the bill into law, those rights vested for individuals who have been sexually abused.”
The law he’s referring to is the 2023 Child Victims Act that removed time limits on lawsuits by survivors of child sexual abuse against the institutions that employed their abusers. The law capped awards for such suits at $890,000 for public institutions, like state agencies, and $1.5 million for private institutions, like the Catholic Church or scouting organizations.
Thousands of claimants, representing a potentially budget-busting bilions in payouts, have since lined up against the state alone for abuse they suffered while children in state care.
Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), himself a survivor of childhood physical and sexual abuse, had pushed for years for the Child Victims Act before winning it in 2023. But when the budget implications became clear, he introduced HB1378 a month into this year’s session.
The bill would lower the cap on lawsuits filed after June 1, from $890,000 to $400,000 for public institutions and from $1.5 million to $700,000 for private institutions. It also narrows the scope of the term “incident” so that all crimes by one abuser against one victim would count as one incident, rather than one incident for every separate assault.
The bill would also cap fees for attorneys at 20% for cases that settle out of court and 25% for cases that result from a court judgment.
Now lawmakers are racing the clock to pass the measure, with the time left in the legislative session being measured now in hours instead of days.
Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, who testified Friday on behalf of Wilson, said about 1,500 lawsuits have been filed so far and another 4,000 cases are waiting to go forward. He said it’s unclear how many are against public or private entities and when they would be filed.
“We’re at a situation, we’re at a point where I believe and the House believes that it’s important for us to begin to figure out how many of these claims are out there,” he said.
Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher (D-Montgomery), vice chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee, asked Clippinger if a suit was filed by May 31 and amended after June 1, would the suit still be eligible for any possible payments from the current law.
“I believe the rules relating to the claims initially put in would hold,” said Clippinger, who added he’s a criminal attorney and not a civil lawyer.
David Lorenz, the Maryland director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, also known as SNAP, attended Friday’s hearing but was not invited to testify, as the committee limited witnesses to keep the process moving along. He said that decreasing the cap amounts will also decrease the number of people who “would be otherwise willing to come and speak out against the abuse they endured,” at a time when what we need is “more accountability against these abusers.”
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick) said Friday night the proposed bill seeks to do two things.
“I think what this bill is trying to do is find a balance between allowing those that have been victimized to have some sense of relief for their continued treatment,” he said. “But also have a balance that we’re already in a fiscal crisis to cause additional irrecoverable financial strains on the state.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/David-Lorenz-4-4-2025-1024x794.jpg,,,2025-04-05 09:03:33.832711

Between drastic cuts to federal programs, mass firings of Marylanders employed by the federal government, and tariffs that will hike prices on goods coming through the Port of Baltimore, the General Assembly is facing a crisis.
To be clear, Maryland was already in a budget hole before Donald Trump moved back into the White House. Since 2017, experts have been warning about a looming $3 billion structural deficit. This long-term shortfall was briefly masked by an influx of COVID-19 relief funds, but those federal resources have long since run out. Larry Hogan and his allies like to claim that the former Republican governor left Maryland’s finances in good shape, but they conveniently overlook how much of the state’s temporary surplus was due to one-time pandemic relief funds.
In stark contrast to his Republican predecessor, Gov. Wes Moore doesn’t have a federal financial cushion to rely on. In fact, the governor has to balance the state budget at a time when Donald Trump is starving our state of federal resources.

As a former member of Congress, I understand how uniquely exposed our state is to what happens in Washington – especially when it comes to the budget.
Cuts to federal programs, particularly in areas like health care, transportation and education, aren’t just abstract numbers on a ledger – they have real-world consequences for Marylanders. Programs like Medicaid and SNAP rely heavily on federal funding, and as those resources dwindle, the state is forced to pick up the tab so that our residents don’t get left behind.
Our proximity to Washington, D.C., also means we have a higher concentration of federal workers than most states, making us especially vulnerable to federal layoffs. When the government cuts jobs or freezes hiring, Maryland feels the pain, with thousands of families directly affected by the loss of income and stability. These layoffs ripple through our communities, affecting not just federal employees, but local businesses and services that depend on their spending power.
And with so many goods passing through the Port of Baltimore, we’re acutely susceptible to Trump’s tariffs. Tariffs on imported goods increase costs for businesses and consumers alike, disrupting supply chains and raising prices on everyday products. For Maryland, which relies heavily on trade and transportation, these tariffs could have serious economic consequences, threatening jobs at the port and in industries that depend on the goods it handles.
Despite these challenges, Gov. Moore and the General Assembly’s budget framework prioritizes what matters: cutting taxes or keeping taxes the same for 94% of Marylanders, growing our economy so we’re less reliant on Washington, and protecting the critical services Marylanders depend on, like access to health care. These priorities are correct – although the details are still getting ironed out in Annapolis.
The governor and legislature are also making tough, honest choices to ensure long-term stability, regardless of what Donald Trump does in the White House. To stimulate growth, the budget framework cuts spending by the largest amount in 16 years. It also asks the wealthiest Marylanders to pay a little bit more. I agree that it’s reasonable to ask someone who’s making over $750,000 a year to give roughly $1,800 more to support our law enforcement and firefighters, strengthen our schools and grow our economy.
I expect Gov. Moore will rise to this challenge, especially given his track record. He’s the first governor in a decade to consistently introduce budgets with general funds that were smaller than the previous year’s. He’s maintained more than $2 billion in the Rainy Day Fund each year – well above the recommended levels – and kept positive cash balances while managing crises like the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The governor also understands we need to support our job creators and workforce alike in order to jump-start our economy.
Donald Trump may be wreaking havoc on our federal government and our state’s finances, but Maryland has a history of resilience. With Gov. Wes Moore at the helm, I’m confident we can weather these difficult times and emerge stronger.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2208184612-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-05 08:00:25.962477

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”

During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender-expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender-affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House.
This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their jobs will be affected if the laws drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.”
But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk.
Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients.
Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
 Structural competency
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum, which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools around the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn. Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried.
When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people. Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.

The stories from Nebraskans are needed to complete a two-year research project about this lesser-known chapter of state history.
“The goal is to increase awareness about Nebraska’s Green Book sites, Black history throughout the state, and reasons to preserve and celebrate it,” said Jade Mendoza, survey coordinator in the State Historic Preservation Office, a division of the Nebraska State Historical Society.
The Historical Society is collaborating with the Durham Museum, Great Plains Black History Museum and the Making Invisible Histories Visible program developed by Omaha Public Schools to seek Nebraskans’ stories associated with Black American travel during the 1950s and 1960s.
The Green Book was published during the Jim Crow segregationist era by Victor Hugo Green, a New York City mailman, to help Black American and international travelers find safe lodging, restaurants, gas stations and other businesses throughout North America.
Publication of the Green Book lasted until 1967, and since then, many Green Book sites have been lost.
“We need Nebraskans’ memories and stories about Black American travel in the state to help us tell this lesser-known Nebraska history,” Mendoza said.
Those with memories of visiting Green Book sites in Nebraska or those who recall stories told by older relatives, can email information to jade.mendoza@nebraska.gov or call 402-429-7465.
Stories also can be submitted using the State Historical Society website at https://history.nebraska.gov/historic-preservation/nebraska-green-book/share-to-nebraska-green-book-project.
Mendoza said that once research and site visits are completed, two Green Book sites will be nominated in Nebraska to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Nebraska State Historic Preservation Office uses historic survey work like this to recognize historic places, understand potential impacts to historic places and to unlock access to preservation-based economic development programs.

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.













A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture





“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

[&#8230;]","The Lincoln Walks at Midnight Statue sits in front of the West Virginia state Capitol building in Charleston, W.Va. (Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)Lawmakers are considering dismantling the state’s Office of Equal Opportunity for the sake of “government efficiency.” But the office, which works to protect West Virginians from discrimination, appears to already be gone.
The Senate approved a three-sentence bill March 29 that would repeal a section of state code mandating the state’s Office of Equal Opportunity. The work — including complying with federal disability rights and anti-discrimination laws — is already being carried out by the state’s Division of Personnel, according to bill sponsor, Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson.
It wasn’t until the members of the House Committee on Government Organization vetted the bill Thursday that it was revealed the office was already likely disbanded, possibly violating state code by not having lawmakers’ required approval.
A website for the office is now offline. State code requires that the Office of Equal Opportunity have a coordinator;  the office’s two employees have been moved elsewhere in state government. 
  Del. Jonathan Kyle, R-Randolph
Sheryl Webb, director of the Division of Personnel, declined to tell House committee members who had directed the division to begin dismantling the office, saying she was fulfilling what had been requested. When Del. Jonathan Kyle, R-Randolph, pressed for an answer, Webb didn’t respond.
Kyle responded, “You don’t throw anybody under the bus, I understand. But this is where we are in state government, with people doing whatever they want to do, and that’s, frankly, unacceptable.”
A spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey did not respond to a question about whether the governor had directed the change. 
  Del. Tristan Leavitt, R-Kanahwa
On Friday, Del. Tristan Leavitt, R-Kanahwa, who serves on the House Government Organization Committee, said that further research led him to believe that nothing was done in violation of state code.
“This office continues to be in place, the duties continue to be performed within the Division of Personnel,” Leavitt said.
“The substantive work that that office does, which is really important work, all of that is still moving forward in a way that’s in compliance. So, for me, that’s very reassuring to know,” Leavitt said. 
Kyle said on Friday that he believed that the situation in committee was a misunderstanding and concurred with Leavitt’s comments. 
  Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, who is also on the committee, said she still thinks that administrators “moved those functionalities around illegally.”
“They can’t just dismantle an office that requires the Legislature,” she said. “During the presentation, they mentioned that, ‘They’ told us to go ahead and move everything.’ We couldn’t get a clear cut answer, whether that was the secretary of administration, or whether that was the governor’s office themselves.” 
Robert Paulson, general counsel for the Department of Administration, maintained that the Office of Equal Opportunity is “not eliminated” with others performing those duties. He told lawmakers that the department is in the process of naming a coordinator. He wasn’t sure who made the call to make the changes.
Rucker said she wasn’t aware of the changes to the Office of Equal Opportunity.
Morrisey targets government efficiency 
Webb said the change was partially spurred by Morrisey’s executive order mandating that government agencies find efficiencies and eliminate waste. Eliminating the Office of Equal Opportunity would save $125,000 in salaries plus $41,250 in benefits, she said.
“We were reviewing how to create efficiencies, this was one of the things that was looked at because of the duplicative nature and the additional cost to it,” Webb said. 
Young said it was also likely a result of Morrisey’s ban on diversity, equity and inclusion practices and policies in state government.
Lawmakers created the Office of Equal Opportunity in 2022. 
A report from the state’s Office of the Legislative Auditor earlier this year said that the office was “needed to facilitate compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws and to minimize liability costs to the state from violations of such laws.”
“However, further progress is needed in developing a statewide and uniform program,” the report said. 
Despite questions about how the office was eliminated, both Young and Leavitt believed that the state could carry out its functions of complying with federal laws and protecting West Virginians from discrimination. The Division of Personnel already offers equal rights education courses and training to state agencies, according to Webb.
“They’re important laws, and I think both the testimony we heard in committee and everything I’ve learned since indicates that they are prioritizing those and doing everything they can to encourage the entire state government to be aware of the law and to comply with it as fully as possible,” Leavitt said. 
Young emphasized that state code mandates that West Virginia have this office until lawmakers approve changes. 
“It is very concerning and definitely does not follow state code,” she said. “I do believe it will probably be debated on the floor, because we still have a lot of questions.”
The legislative session adjourns April 12.

National Heritage Areas are “lived-in landscapes” that are “representative of the national experience through the physical features that remain and the traditions that have evolved in them,” as defined by the Park Service.
The Great Dismal Swamp is an environmental and cultural treasure, home to dozens of species of animals and, at one time, groups of Native Americans and formerly enslaved people who used it as a pathway to freedom.
The important details of where the conceptual boundary of the Great Dismal Swamp’s National Heritage Area would lie and who would manage any conservation, recreation and education opportunities remain unanswered questions at the moment.
Sometime in 2026, the Park Service plans to submit a feasibility study to Congress that will answer those questions. Congress will have the final say on whether the region is suited for the federal designation.
There are currently 62 designated National Heritage Areas in 36 states and territories. The unique federal designation does not result in any land transfers, local zoning changes or easements.

The entire state of Tennessee is a designated National Heritage Area, and the rights of landowners are not affected by the designation.
“A lot of people fear government overreach…” said John Warren, Communications Specialist at the National Park Service Northeast Region.
“There’s no such federal footprint in a National Heritage Area. It is entirely something that the local community takes on and runs itself.”
Any federal funding for the proposed National Heritage Area would come by way of congressional appropriation.
“A lot of those National Heritage Areas may receive up to $1 million annually, but others get a lot less,” said Warren. National Heritage Areas must receive matching funds from non-federal sources as well.
The role of the National Park Service is to be a partner and advisor to the actual manager of the Heritage Area, called the “local coordinating entity,” an organization within the community chosen to interpret the history and traditions of the area and manage the conservation, recreation and education goals laid out by the project.
Creating a National Heritage Area
During virtual meetings held last week, members of the public shared their ideas on the Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area’s potential location, its coordinating entity, and the natural, cultural and historic resources the region has to offer.

The public was also asked if opportunities exist for improving the quality of those resources through conservation, recreation and education. Comments are encouraged to be submitted in writing online, by mail or over the phone until May 19.
The public comments are not meant to be a vote, said Warren, but “a way to collect information.”
“The study has 10 criteria, and the answer to all of these has got to be ‘yes’ for us to be able to give a favorable conclusion that, yes, this qualifies as a National Heritage Area,” said Warren. “So it’s a high bar.”
Warren said that anecdotally, over the last ten years only about half of the National Heritage Areas that were applied for ended up receiving the designation from Congress.
As part of the study, the National Park Service staff has also spoken with potential state and local partners as well as possible coordinating entities. Chesapeake City Council has voiced interest in assuming the managing role, said Julie Bell, cultural resource project manager for the Park Service.
Nonprofits, universities, and state and local governments are some examples of coordinating entities that were chosen to manage other Heritage Areas around the nation. Any entity outside of the federal government is allowed to assume the role, including Indigenous tribes, said Bell.
The Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area will involve coordination across state lines since the Virginia-North Carolina border slices directly through the swamp.
In 2003, the Northern Neck National Heritage Area was established along with six others around the nation. The designation was Virginia’s third National Heritage Area to date.
Two other possible National Heritage Areas have completed their feasibility studies and are currently awaiting a decision from Congress: the Finger Lakes Region in New York and the Kentucky Wildlands.
The story of the swamp
  An 1862 painting of the Great Dismal Swamp titled “Slaves Escaping Through the Swamp” by Thomas Moran (Photo courtesy of the National Park Service)
The National Park Service is developing themes that are present in the Great Dismal Swamp region to tell a nationally distinctive heritage story. One theme is “a place of refuge” and another is “a field of conflict.”
Based on artifacts found in the Great Dismal Swamp dating back over 5,000 years, the Nansemond, Meherrin, Yeopim and Lumbee people were likely stewards of the swamp long before European colonists arrived, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
After colonization, the role of the swamp for local communities changed. About 50,000 self-emancipated African Americans, called maroons, along with free Blacks, Indigenous people and Europeans lived in the swamp in search of refuge.
Some used it as a pause point on their journeys north, making the swamp an official water-based rest stop on the Underground Railroad, but others settled permanent communities there up until the end of the Civil War.
Today, the Great Dismal Swamp is protected by a 113,000 acre National Wildlife Refuge managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. What is now a vast, uninhabited landscape is actually just a remnant of its former self.
The once enormous swamp covered over 1 million acres, roughly the size of Delaware, but was drained over the years, first by a young George Washington in 1763.
Washington and other investors initially aimed to create land in the swamp that could be sold for profit, then to dig a canal to transport goods across the swamp. Enslaved people were forced to provide the labor for these early economic ventures.
One of the most successful business opportunities in the swamp turned out to be logging. The now globally rare Atlantic white cedar was in high demand, and gaining access to the trees required digging ditches to drain the swamp. By the 1950s, the last of the virgin timber in the Great Dismal Swamp was gone, according to a National Park Service story map.
The future of the swamp
On George Washington’s birthday in 1973, about 50,000 acres of swamp land was donated to the Nature Conservancy and then handed over to the Fish & Wildlife Service, thus creating the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge.
“We have discovered that swamps actually play a vital role in our environment and that they are necessary,” said Warren. “You know, they’re not just places that we want to avoid because they have a lot of mosquitos or something like that. They’re places that are useful to the environment.”
The Fish and Wildlife Service says the swamp serves as a permanent and migratory home for roughly 50 species of mammals, 200 types of birds and 100 species of butterflies. The diverse ecosystem ranges from bald cypress to red maple and Virginia’s last historic refuge of native Atlantic white cedar.
In addition to the habitat the swamp provides to wildlife, it also prevents floods and improves water quality in nearby communities with a combined population of nearly 1 million people, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.
A 2017 project to re-moisten the peat soils of the swamp served to benefit the surrounding population, including in Suffolk, by restoring a more natural water regime in the area. The Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners installed adjustable dams in key places to regulate the amount of water leaving the swamp, improving the environment’s ability to provide its once inherent benefits.
The re-moistened peat is now able to absorb stormwater more efficiently, acting like a sponge to reduce flooding during severe weather such as the storms and hurricanes that are common in the region. Healthy peat also stores more carbon, a valuable tool in combating global climate change.
“This is a region that has already changed a lot,” said Warren. Creating a National Heritage Area “may have some influence on that, or it may not.” Those decisions would be left to the local community and the chosen coordinating entity.

If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?” (Getty Images)When the government puts legal barriers in place to strip away or prevent health care access, it’s not just politics — it’s real people’s lives at stake.
During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House. This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their job will be affected if the laws would drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.”
But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk. Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients.
Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum, which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools across the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn. Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried. When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people.
Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe 2025 legislative session ended abruptly Friday when the Senate suddenly adjourned earlier than usual, catching many people in the bustling Georgia Capitol off guard and throwing the House into disarray.

The last day of the 40-day legislative session, when the House and Senate usually crank out legislation right up until midnight and celebrate at the end of the night by throwing torn-up pieces of paper into the air, ended with a whimper. 
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones sent senators home a little after 9 p.m. Friday. Senators seemed to be taken off-guard – the floor of the chamber was littered not with the customary shreds of paper but entire crumpled up sheets.
“We’d already gotten all our priorities done, and I’ve been saying all day, of course, I’ve been leading up to the last two days saying we’re going to adjourn early,” Jones told reporters after the Senate gaveled out. “I actually was trying to get done earlier than now, but there were a few more priorities that we went ahead and got some ‘agrees’ on and everything, but it was a good session, and we got a lot of things done.”
Not all of Jones’ top priorities were successful, including the Red Tape Rollback Act, also known as Georgia’s DOGE, aimed at cutting government bureaucracy.

The abrupt ending to Senate business seemed to surprise House lawmakers. After a break, the chamber gaveled back in to pass a few more bills and resume the ceremonial thank-yous to House staff and the throwing of the paper scraps.
Speaking to reporters after the final gavel, Newington Republican and House Speaker Jon Burns said the House had accomplished what it had set out to, with the exception of efforts to rein in the use of school zone speed cameras. 
Dozens of bills were left in limbo Friday but will still be active when lawmakers return for the second half of the biennium next January. 
Burns also lobbed a jab at the other chamber.

“I just think it shows that the House is focusing on its priorities and getting the job done, and we’re not worried about moving on to some kind of higher office. We came here to do a job and we did our job, and that’s what drives the House,” Burns said. 
Jones is widely expected to announce a run for governor in 2026, and other high-ranking senators are reportedly mulling runs for other top positions like lieutenant governor and attorney general. At least one senator, McDonough Republican Sen. Brian Strickland, who is running for attorney general, has filed his papers to run for statewide office. 
Friday night was a peculiar end to a session that had been dominated by debate over new limits on lawsuits, a slate of culture war bills largely focused on transgender Georgians and efforts to improve security on Georgia’s campuses after last year’s Apalachee High School shooting that left two students and two teachers dead. 
Lawmakers pass next year’s budget amid economic uncertainty 
  Gov. Brian Kemp. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Lawmakers passed a budget for the next budget year on the final day of this year’s legislative session as economic uncertainty looms on the national level.
The $37.8 million budget notably includes spending boosts for the state’s prisons and schools, and it’s slightly larger than the one Gov. Brian Kemp unveiled when the legislation session began. The governor, who sets the spending level, added $50.4 million to next year’s revenue estimate Friday.
The budget, which takes effect July 1, was sent to the governor as the Trump administration’s historic tariffs upset the global economy and as economic forecasters say the U.S. economy could be heading toward a recession.
The S&P 500 has dropped 10% over two days after Trump unveiled his tariff plan.
“Our budget is predicated on a revenue estimate, and I think it’s fair to say that since we reconvened in January, the macro-economic picture has changed pretty dramatically in just over the last few days,” Rep. Scott Holcomb, an Atlanta Democrat, said to the House’s top budget writer, Rep. Matt Hatchett.
  Rep. Matt Hatchett Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“How comfortable are you with the probability that the revenue estimates that make this budget will hold throughout the year?” Holcomb said.
Hatchett, a Dublin Republican, responded that if there are “huge swings” then lawmakers would likely need to return to Atlanta for a special session to adjust the spending plan.
But Hatchett and other House Republican leaders told reporters later that they do not think that is likely.
“Certainly, a good businessperson is always looking forward and trying to be ready for what’s coming next,” Burns said. “If we don’t do that, then we’re not doing our job. So, we’re conscious of those possibilities, and we’re in a very, very strong position when it comes to reserves.”
Hatchett said Friday that the state has over $12 billion in reserves. Although he said he thinks it’s unlikely that lawmakers will need to be summoned back later this year, he said he thinks a “correction” could be on the horizon.
Lawmakers pass bipartisan landlord bill 
  Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
A bipartisan bill intended to hold out-of-state landlords more accountable for managing single-family homes across Georgia is awaiting the governor’s signature.
Decatur Democratic Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, who is the sponsor of House Bill 399, called the measure a good first step to deal with investor-owned homes that are popping up all over metro Atlanta. Under the legislation, landlords with single-family homes or duplexes have to hire Georgia brokers or other in-state management to handle tenant maintenance and other housing issues. 
Both chambers passed the bill before this year’s session ended late Friday, with the Senate passing it with a 46-9 vote. 
Advocates for housing rights point to the significant economic hit caused by fewer single-family homes available for first-time buyers.
“We know that the local property owners, the local property managements, are struggling with this competition that’s coming from the hedge funds, the out-of-state investors who are impacting our market in a bad way,” Oliver said following Friday’s Senate vote on her bill.
Oliver’s bill was carried in the Senate by Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns, who said the problem is more widespread than Atlanta.
“It’s an issue in our smaller, urban areas as well as our metropolitan areas,” Burns said. “It’ll impact rural Georgia when it gets down to Bulloch County, Statesboro, Valdosta or Macon. You’re not seeing it just in Metro. If you look at the districts where there’s more than 25% of available rental housing owned by investors, that creates a challenge.”
Many bills left lingering

The first year of the two-year legislative session concluded without the final passage of one of Jones’ top priorities, a so-called red tape rollback bill as coined by Jones to be a state-level version of the Elon Musk-led federal Department of Government Efficiency.
Senate Bill 28, which cleared the chamber in February by a 33-21 vote that fell along party lines, failed to make it to the House floor for debate Friday. This is the second year Jones’ red tape rollback had not made it out of the House. 
The most significant GOP election bill for the session also failed to get a final vote Friday in the House. 
The House adjourned before legislators were presented with a substitute version of House Bill 397 that cleared the Senate after the addition of several proposals such as expanding State Election Board powers and banning Georgia from being a member of multi-state voter rolls sharing databases. Instead, the House passed a resolution Friday creating a study committee that will examine election rules later this year. 
A pair of firearm-related bills were also left unfinished. The House had spent more than an hour Friday debating a proposal that targets a Savannah ordinance penalizing gun owners who leave their firearms in unlocked vehicles. Under the proposal, someone facing a fine would be able to sue the city for as much as $25,000 in damages.

And a House proposal that originally aimed to encourage safe gun storage through an income tax credit stalled after a compromise version limited the tax credit to gun safety training and spliced it with a Senate bill creating a four-day sales tax holiday for firearms, ammunition and other accessories, like scopes and magazines – as well as gun safes.
This year, lawmakers passed a ban on transgender athletes in girls’ sports and signed off on another bill seeking to block inmates from receiving gender-affirming care. This also proved to be the year that legislators passed a so-called religious freedom bill, which Kemp signed Friday over concerns that it would lead to discrimination against LGBTQ people and religious minorities. 
But other controversial red meat bills were left behind for now, including a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion programs or policies from all state public schools and universities. Other stalled measures would have banned gender-affirming care for state workers and made it harder for minors to be treated with puberty blockers for gender dysphoria.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia Senate approved a bill Friday that allows criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct, a description that recalls the Fulton County prosecutor who brought felony charges against President Donald Trump.
Next stop is Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk for a signature.
Senate Bill 244, originally inspired by Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, was later amended to revive the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act, a stalled House bill that was aimed at providing reparations to people wrongfully incarcerated.
House lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have faced an uphill battle in their efforts to properly compensate those who have been wrongfully incarcerated. The process is currently done on a case-by-case basis through individual compensation resolutions that must pass through the full legislative process like any other bill. Legislation to standardize the process was initially introduced by Atlanta Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb in 2022, and re-introduced in 2023, but his efforts have repeatedly been stalled in the Senate by Republican opposition. 
The version that ultimately emerged as the clock ran out on the 2025 legislative session Friday, sponsored by Alpharetta Republican Sen. Brandon Beach, secured a 35-18 vote in its second pass through the Senate, with all Republicans and the three highest-ranking Senate Democrats voting in support of the legislation. Its passage also marked a final sine die gavel for Beach, a staunch Trump ally who was recently appointed by the president to serve as U.S. Treasurer.
If Gov. Brian Kemp signs the bill into law, it will allow criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs from county prosecuting attorneys’ budgets in cases where the prosecutor is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct. (During Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was disqualified after an appeals court judge found that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a “significant appearance of impropriety.”)
Separately, it will establish a new process under Georgia state law for people who have been convicted for crimes they did not commit and later exonerated, allowing administrative law judges to rule on wrongful conviction compensation cases and awarding a standardized rate of $75,000 for each year of incarceration to each exoneree, with an additional $25,000 added for each year spent on death row.
This is the third consecutive biennium that legislators in the House have attempted to reform the system for compensating those who have been wrongfully incarcerated. However, Republican opposition in the Senate — particularly from Sen. Randy Robertson, a Cataula Republican and former law enforcement officer — has repeatedly stalled those efforts. Under current Georgia law, those who have been wrongfully convicted must find a state representative who is willing to sponsor an individual compensation resolution for them and file a claim with Georgia’s Claims Advisory Board. Those resolutions then go through the full legislative process and must pass committees and floor votes in both the House and Senate before they can take effect, but those efforts too have routinely died in the Senate in recent years.
Though Robertson emphasized that he was still not fully on board with the legislation aimed at compensating the wrongfully convicted, he conceded that the current system was in need of reform in a speech on the final day of the 2025 legislative session.
“What I realized is the process is not a good process,” Robertson said, but vowed to continue workshopping the wrongful conviction component of the bill after the 2025 legislative session concludes.
“I’m going to ask you today to support the senator from the 21st and vote for this legislation, and in the off-season, we’ll tackle the other thing that’s attached to it and we’ll come up with a process that works,” he continued, addressing his Senate colleagues. “Support this bill, get it across, and I promise you the fight’s not over.”
Democrats also condemned the original language of the bill, arguing that it could have a disproportionate impact on smaller counties with more limited budgets, and discourage prosecutors from tackling complex or high-profile cases.
But Holcomb celebrated its passage.
“This will give hope to real people whose lives were devastated and destroyed by a wrongful conviction, and it gives them a path to get some measure of compensation so they can restart their lives,” he said. “I’m very grateful for that. This is a major legislative achievement that comes out of this session.”
Though he acknowledged that there is no way to fully undo a wrongful conviction, he hopes that the new system will bring equality and efficiency to the process.
“There isn’t a person alive who would trade the money that these individuals are receiving for what happened to them in terms of being locked up in our state’s prisons, for usually for decades of their lives for something that they didn’t do,” he said. “This is a path to provide some remedy. It’s an inadequate remedy in terms of nothing can bring back those years, but it’s an adequate remedy in terms of dollars that will really help them through the remaining years of their lives.”

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)House and Senate fiscal leaders reached final agreement Friday on a compromise budget that includes $1.6 billion in annual taxes and ends a one-year experiment with a racing authority tasked with modernizing a storied racetrack and preserving an industry.
The deal reached Friday on a $67 billion total budget comes after two days of negotiations that were less tense than in recent years. The House and Senate each must now vote one final time to approve the deal that is contained in two companion budget bills.
“We made sure our core programs are solid and funded. In the process, we’ve been grownups — a big difference, I think from what you see at the federal level,” said House Appropriations Chair Del. Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel). We know we had to take cuts, and we took about $2 billion in cuts, but we also raised revenues to make sure our core values are protected and funded.”
The overall budget — a figure that includes all state, federal and special revenues — will grow by a little more than 1%. Maryland’s General Fund budget, the smaller portion funded by direct taxes to state residents, decreases by more than $400 million.
Final House and Senate votes could come as early as Saturday. Republicans, who make up the minority of the House and Senate, are expected to oppose the plan but cannot, on their own, prevent Democrats from passing it.
Federal budget actions are triggering
Concerns remain about the potential harm from rampant federal budget cuts and layoffs. The final legislative plan includes a trigger provision that requires a report to lawmakers from the Department of Budget and Management if cuts to federal aid to the state or other reductions reach $1 billion.
“The idea simply is, as we move forward when things may be happening to us from Washington, we’ll be getting prepared and ready to be having discussions and understanding exactly all the impacts,” said Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) to reporters Friday afternoon.
A separate set of trigger provisions remains under negotiation as part of an effort to tame some cost of the state’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms.
Cuts, taxes, shifts
Lawmakers and Gov. Wes Moore (D) began the session facing a $3 billion structural deficit.
Moore’s budget as introduced included $2 billion in cuts. Some of those were related to vacant positions. Others merely shifted costs the state paid to local governments. Those shifts included teacher pensions and the costs of property assessments.
Another, added by the legislature, requires local jurisdictions to pick up 50% of any settlement in a case where someone was erroneously convicted.
Other administration cuts to programs, including those for persons with developmental disabilities, were restored by lawmakers — although the ever-shifting budget picture saw Moore this week impose a new $28.8 million in cuts for developmental disability services.
Tech tax tweaks
Among the biggest changes is a new sales tax on information technology and data services. The 3% tech tax is expected to raise nearly $500 million for the state.
On Friday, House and Senate fiscal leaders made several tweaks to the plan.

One amendment made it clear that affiliated companies would not be subject to the tax — a concern some opponents said could exponentially increase costs.
“It was never the intent that that would occur,” said Barnes, adding that the “scoring,” or potential revenue realized from the tax did not include that specific situation.
Another excluded companies in “emerging technology development areas,” specifically the “Discovery District” in College Park. The change exempts companies such as IonQ and companies that do business with a developer of quantum computing technology from the services sales tax. Moore has made the development of quantum computing and other technologies a focal point of his efforts to diversify the state’s economy.
“It certainly matters that it’s the governor’s priority, but it’s all our priority,” Guzzone said.
The changes do not address concerns that the tax would either bankrupt some companies doing federal subcontracting work or force them to move out of Maryland to avoid the tax.
Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s), vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, said last month that he moved his IT business out of the state rather than lose his company.
House Ways and Means Chair Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) said the change would not affect how the tax is applied to businesses similar to Crosby’s.
The state will also add a 6% sales tax to vending machine purchases.
Lawmakers recast Moore’s tax modernization proposal
Moore’s spending plan included a proposal he said would modernize the state’s income tax system. Under his plan, he created two new tax brackets for high earners beginning at $500,000. The new brackets are expected to generate nearly $344 million annually in new revenue for the state.
The proposal also included a 2% surcharge on capital gains over $350,000. That tax, which would be split between the general fund and the Transportation Trust Fund, is expected to bring in nearly $370 million annually.
As part of the income tax revisions, 94% of Maryland taxpayers will see either no increase or some reduction in their income taxes. The average reduction is expected to be between $50 and $65 annually.
The budget includes a 20% increase in the standard deduction — much lower than the doubling Moore proposed.
Moore also proposed eliminating itemized deductions. The legislature rejected that idea and instead opted for a plan that slowly phases out itemized deductions at $200,000 of taxable income.
The General Assembly also rejected Moore’s proposal to repeal the state inheritance tax. The governor planned to pay for the change with a broader application of the estate tax. Maryland is the only state with both an inheritance and an estate tax.
The compromise agreement also increases the maximum piggyback income tax rate for local governments to 3.3%. The current maximum is 3.2%.
Also increasing are taxes on sports betting and cannabis. The budget includes increasing the tax on sports betting operations in Maryland from 15% to 20%.
The sales tax on recreational cannabis will jump from the current 9% — equal to that assessed on alcohol products — to 15% in July.
Moore’s plan to lower corporate income taxes also died Friday.
The governor proposed lowering the current rate of 8.25% to 7.99%. The reduction was pegged to a requirement to pass combined corporate tax reporting and have it phased in over two years.
The House, in its amended budget plan, added combined reporting but crossed out the corporate tax reduction. The Senate took the House version and nixed combined reporting.
In the end, the two sides agreed to kill both parts of the proposal, leaving the state exactly where it is today.
Racetrack Authority put out to pasture
Lawmakers also agreed to a plan to eliminate the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority. The panel was created in 2023. Last year, it consummated a deal with the owners of Pimlico to effectively take over the racecourse, the Preakness Stakes and thoroughbred racing in the state.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Atterbeary said lawmakers “wanted some more oversight and to be able to know and understand what’s going on in real time, which wasn’t happening.”
The budget package eliminates the racetrack authority. In its place, lawmakers will task the Maryland Stadium Authority with overseeing the new training facility and a rebuilt Pimlico Race Track.
Atterbeary said she does not believe the changes made in the budget will delay the work of modernizing Pimlico.
Cash infusion for Transportation Trust Fund
The plan also attempts to bolster the state’s flagging Transportation Trust Fund — a pot of money used to pay for the state’s roads, highways and transit projects.
The two sides had agreed roughly on a target figure of around $400 million annually. They differed on how to get there.
In the end, the House and Senate agreed to a menu of revenues that is estimated to general more than $2.3 billion over five years beginning July 1. That includes an estimated $500 million in fiscal 2026.
Nearly a quarter of that revenue will come from a portion of the new capital gains surcharge. Another $520 million comes from an increase in the costs of titling a vehicle in Maryland.
The two sides also compromised on an increase in the sales tax on a car purchase starting in July. The House initially proposed increasing the tax from 6% to 6.8%. The Senate amended that plan with a tax that phased in over two years to a maximum of 6.5%.
In the end, the two sides landed on a 6.5% sales tax on cars with no phase-in period.
The state will also add a new 3.5% excise tax on rental vehicles. That tax is expected to bring in $240 million.
The state will also pick up $52 million by accelerating the phase-in of higher vehicle registration fees passed last year.
Another $150 million over five years will come from increasing the fees for the state’s Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program. The test, which currently costs $14, will soon cost $30. Late fees face a similar increase.
Republican victory erased in compromise
The House also agreed to accept a Senate plan to add a $5 per tire fee — nearly $110 million over five years— for the trust fund. Republicans in the Senate scored a victory this week in the form of an amendment that earmarked the money for roads and highways.
That victory was short-lived as the Senate gave up the earmark as part of negotiations.

Under the proposal, police departments would be able to shield almost all information about officers’ stops, arrests and incident responses. And it would have created broad new exemptions to prevent public disclosure of the General Assembly’s activities, including communication with other parts of state government
The change narrowing what police records are available for public inspection appeared to be in response to a lawsuit filed by the Appen Media Group against Sandy Springs that accused the city of withholding public police reports. The state Court of Appeals had recently ruled in Appen’s favor.
Gov. Brian Kemp also seemed cool to the proposal Friday.
“I haven’t seen what the Legislature has done other than just reading a blip in the paper about it,” Kemp told reporters. “But we’ll look at the legislation today. We’ll see what ends up passing or not passing. But I think the General Assembly knows that I’m a pretty transparent person, as you can see being out here answering your questions today.” 
The House ultimately retreated from the changes Friday and passed a version that was more in line with the original proposal – to the relief of the bill’s sponsor, Danielsville Republican Sen. Frank Ginn.
“You don’t want to get into an argument with people that buy ink by the train car load,” Ginn said, referring to concerns from newspapers and others.
Ginn said he was trying to pass a “pro-business bill.” His proposal came in response to a Georgia Supreme Court ruling last year that unanimously found that a private contractor working for a public entity is still subject to the law and can be sent requests for public records they may possess. 
Senate Bill 12 said that requests for those public records should go through the local governmental agencies that contracted with those third parties. This version is what now sits on the governor’s desk.

In a press release sent April 4, the party&#8217;s executive committee announced it had censured [&#8230;]","Senator-elect Josh Kassmier, a former House representative from Fort Benton, at a Senate Republican caucus meeting on Nov. 12, 2024. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The Montana Republican Party has censured nine state senators and will no longer consider them to be Republicans — but the senators say they hold firm to the conservative mantle and the party should not insert itself into legislative business.
In a press release sent April 4, the party’s executive committee announced it had censured the nine senators for their “repeated alignment with Senate Democrats” this legislative session and for “undermining Republican priorities and leadership.”
The censure calls out the nine’s “unprecedented alliance” with Senate Democrats as a “coordinated scheme” to undermine the GOP leadership, including alleging ethical violations by Senate President Matt Regier, found to be unsubstantiated by the Legislative Auditor.
The committee unanimously voted for the censure on March 27 to the surprise Friday of at least four of the nine.
“I’m dumbfounded,” said Sen. Russ Tempel, R-Chester. “I’ve been a Republican longer than ( state GOP Executive Director Tyler) Newcombe’s been alive.” 
In an extensive letter to the head of the state GOP, obtained by the Daily Montanan, Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, said his responsibility is to the people of Montana, “not party bosses like you.”
The letter was an attempt to argue against the potential censure, and Kassmier emailed it to GOP Chairman Don Kaltschmidt on March 27.
However, Kassmier said he learned Friday that Kaltschmidt did not receive the letter; Newcombe also said neither he nor Kaltschmidt have seen the letter, but they made attempts to meet with the nine.
None of the nine showed up to the executive committee meeting on March 27; several cited conflicts while others said they had never received invitations. 
In the letter, Kassmier said he is a conservative who supports the agenda of Republican President Donald Trump. Kassmier also accuses Senate President Regier, R-Kalispell, of “playing political games” to undermine Gov. Greg Gianforte’s agenda and of working with Democrats.
“I support the conservative tax plans endorsed by Gov. Gianforte. I oppose the liberal tax plans pushed by President Regier,” the letter said. “ … The governor’s tax plans are consistent with the Montana Republican Party Platform. The tax plans pushed by President Regier are not.”
Regier said Friday he had not seen the letter. However he responded to the censure of the senators by saying it was basically an acknowledgement of the status quo in the Senate. 
“It’s been a very frustrating session for Republicans from the first day,” Regier said. 
The division between Senate Republicans began at the start of the 69th Legislature, when the nine — Kassmier, Tempel, Jason Ellsworth, Wendy McKamey, Gayle Lammers, Butch Gillespie, Gregg Hunter, Denley Loge, and Shelley Vance — joined all Democrats to change the chamber’s rules, going against GOP leadership.
That coalition, in essence a working majority, has repeatedly flexed its muscles over the last three months to pass big pieces of legislation, change committees and at times effectively run the Senate floor, as well as block attempts to expel one of their members, Ellsworth, for ethics violations. Ellsworth has since been censured by the Senate.
Previously, the state GOP executive committee issued a statement “strongly rebuking” the senators, saying additional steps would follow if the group did not stop its actions against the party.

“Despite multiple calls for unity and adherence to Republican principles, the senators have chosen to align with Democrats, undermining Republican priorities and leadership,” the statement about the censure said. “…These Senators have undermined the Republican majority leadership and disregarded the will of Montana Republican voters.”
The executive board also voted to withhold any political funding for the nine in future elections and said the nine shouldn’t be considered to speak for the party. 
Sen. Hunter, however, said his duty is to his constituents.
“The GOP central committee didn’t elect me,” Hunter said. “I don’t know what they’re using as a litmus test or not, but if you look at the Montana conservative scorecard, I’m more conservative than most Republicans.”
Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, said she’s “as Republican as they come,” and the state GOP was mischaracterizing the senators’ actions. 
“We aren’t voting with the Democrats. The Democrats are voting with us to support the governor — not doing what other Republicans are doing to fight the governor,” McKamey said. “We’re doing the kinds of things good Republicans do.”
McKamey also said she was recently notified that she is receiving an award from the Republican National Committee for her conservatism.
In his letter, Kassmier wrote that his “strong conservative values” helped him defeat state GOP Vice Chairperson Lola Sheldon-Galloway in the 2024 primary for his Senate seat.
Kassmier also presents himself as a fiscal conservative and alleges Regier is working with Democrats in the House and is “a true liberal” spending taxpayer money on things like lawyers and new office furniture.
“A real conservative would never dream of spending money like President Regier,” Kassmier said in the letter. “When it comes to spending taxpayer money, President Regier is not a leader I follow.”
From the start of the session, however, Regier has repeatedly expressed frustration with the size of the governor’s budget and an interest in taking a closer look at spending in the state.
The censure Friday and allegations in the letter from Kassmier bring the split among Senate Republicans to the fore again as the legislature closes in on its last few weeks of work.
However, Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, said he will continue to work with all 32 Republicans and talk with them daily given the limited time left in the session.
“I’d like us to see us come together and get as much good legislation as we can out of here. So I’m not disowning anybody,” McGillvray said. “… I cannot look at a group of Republicans and say, ‘You don’t belong to us anymore.’
“That’s exactly a way to destroy what we need to accomplish for the good of Montana people.”
Kassmier said he echoed the sentiment toward unity. “We got a lot of work to do.”

MCSO stressed in a statement that [&#8230;]","The Milwaukee County Courthouse. (Photo | Isiah Holmes)Two people have been arrested at the Milwaukee County Courthouse by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, the sheriff’s office said Friday. Although the Milwaukee County Sheriffs Office (MCSO) was aware of the first arrest, the office states that it was not given advance notice of the second arrest. MCSO stressed in a statement that it did not participate in either arrest, and that it’s “not uncommon for local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to search available databases for upcoming court hearings of individuals they are seeking.” 
MCSO has not responded to a request for more details. A spokesperson for ICE said the agency was unable to confirm the arrests without additional information about the specific targets. Fears of immigration operations have been heightened since President Donald Trump announced that the government would pursue mass deportations. ICE has made hundreds of arrests in recent months, including of people who were not convicted of any  crime and activists who participated in  protests on college campuses. 
Local groups and officials are condemning the arrests at the courthouse. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said that the courthouse “stands as a cornerstone of justice where residents come to seek information, resources and fair participation in the legal process.” Crowley said that “an attack on this safe, community-serving space undermines public trust, breeds fear among citizens and staff and disrupts the due process essential to our courts.” Crowley called on local leaders to protect Milwaukee’s institutions, as well as due process for people in the judicial process. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Tim Muth, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, said in a statement that “such actions create fear among immigrant members of our community coming to the courthouse to seek justice as crime victims or witnesses.”  Muth added, “Research by the ACLU has shown that when ICE is known to be active in courthouses, members of the immigrant community are less likely to report crimes, less likely to cooperate with police and prosecutors, and less likely to make their court appearances. Our communities become less safe as a consequence.” 
In 2017, according to the ACLU’s “Freezing Out Justice” report, a survey sample of police officers reported that immigrants appeared less likely to report crimes after immigration operations conducted during Trump’s first term. Crime victims and witnesses were reluctant to assist police due to the fear of being deported. Legal service providers who worked with immigrant communities also reported encountering that victims chose to stay in abusive or dangerous situations rather than expose themselves to ICE operations. 
Muth and the ACLU call on the Milwaukee County court system and sheriff’s office to prevent similar actions in the future. “The last thing we want is to interfere with the legal process or sow doubt in those summoned to the courthouse about whether or not they will receive fair, impartial justice,” said Crowley. “I will continue working with our partners across the county and state to maintain safety and justice for all.”
The Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression also condemned the arrests. “We take this to be a sign of heightened racist and political repression against immigrants,” the Alliance said in a statement. “Furthermore, we are concerned by the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office acceptance of these arrests, stating that it’s not uncommon practice for agencies to access databases of people scheduled to appear before court. There is already very little trust with the MCSO, and now people have to fear for their safety inside the courthouse?”
The activist group, which has called for civilian oversight of law enforcement in Milwaukee County, stressed that people use the courthouse for all sorts of reasons, most of which are not related to criminal activity. “With today’s arrests, there is a further stigma placed on immigrants who enter the courthouse, making them feel even more criminalized,” the Alliance said in a statement. “We need city and county officials like the Sheriff to take a clear stance against ICE operating in Milwaukee. Sheriff [Denita] Ball has the authority to not collaborate with ICE, but this is a sign that she may very well choose to do so.”

Officials did not provide a price tag Friday when announcing the broader development that one official described as a “defining moment” for North Omaha.

They said the remainder of the venture would be funded by local, private foundations.
Currently, officials said, the Vikings of North High are the only high school in the Omaha Public Schools without a competitive home stadium for football and soccer. On game day, athletes, band members and fans travel to a different school to play.
Gene Haynes, a longtime North High principal and an OPS administrator for more than 40 years, was among speakers at a media event that included world champion boxer Terence “Bud” Crawford, students, alumni, community members, city leaders and school administrators.
Haynes recalled more than a decade ago when a group of students came to him with a stadium proposal they called “Leveling the playing field.” 
When he learned just recently that a stadium was to become a reality, without having to raze any homes, Haynes said he was “tickled pink.”
“We are going to continue to build this community,” he said.
 Change of plans 

A rendering unveiled during the announcement at the Butler-Gast YMCA shows the campus rising along Ames Avenue, just east of North High and on YMCA land.
The current 30-year-old Butler-Gast building will close for demolition this fall. A new structure with the same legacy name — honoring John Butler and Carol Gast, who were pivotal in creating opportunities for Black youths — will rise on the corner of North 34th and Ames Avenues, with a gym, pool, exercise and community rooms.

The Vikings stadium and a parking lot is to be built between the new YMCA structure and North High School.
Rebecca Deterding, CEO and president of the YMCA of Greater Omaha, said the idea for Project Game On came as YMCA leaders were moving forward with a planned renovation of the Butler-Gast building. 
For that, it was using a $2 million award from the North and South Omaha Recovery Grant program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.
State officials in January 2024 had announced nearly $235 million in awards to about 130 groups and businesses in North and South Omaha, including the YMCA. That pool of funds was part of the Economic Recovery Act money state lawmakers had allocated to help bring “transformational” change to historically disinvested areas.
The YMCA’s game plan changed, Deterding said, when the Lozier Foundation asked the nonprofit to consider a bigger project. She said the YMCA is providing the land for the overall project.
Lozier wanted to move swiftly so the DED grant, which is subject to a deadline, could be used as part of Project Game On, Deterding said.
The Sherwood Foundation also committed funding, officials said. Among other collaborators listed on a new website, projectgameon.org, include NewStreet Properties, Alley Poyner Macchietto Architecture, The City of Omaha, OPS, YMCA and Emspace + Lovgren. 
 ‘Game-changer’

Deterding called the project “a defining moment for North Omaha” that is about “transforming lives.” She said it was a testament to possibilities when public school districts and nonprofits come together with a shared vision.

“Through innovative partnerships like this, we are not only creating a new facility but also driving long-lasting community change — ensuring that families have access to the health, wellness and youth development opportunities they deserve for generations to come,” Deterding said.
Construction on the North High stadium is to begin later this year also. It will include a new press box, concessions, restrooms, team rooms and equipment storage. Stadium capacity will be similar to other Omaha public high school stadiums, such as Northwest High, where the Vikings currently play home games.
The current practice field at North High will remain as a practice field and home to the school’s track and field team, said Matthew Ray, OPS superintendent, who called the newly announced project site a “game-changer” for the community.
Other speakers included Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and Nebraska’s State Poet Jewel Rodgers, who introduced her former principal, Haynes.
Said Stothert: “Together these facilities will create an environment for excellence in competition, sportsmanship and teamwork, access to fitness, recreation and wellness programs and a community space where Viking fans will gather to celebrate victories of years past and future.”

(Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest  photo)Federal land managers have canceled their proposal to withdraw about 264,000 acres of public land in Nevada’s Ruby Mountain from oil, gas and geothermal development.
The U.S. Forest Service said the decision to allow oil and gas leasing to continue in Elko County’s Ruby Mountains was brought on by a presidential executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” and calling on federal land managers to remove regulatory barriers to energy production and expand access to federal lands and waters for energy exploration.
In a statement Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, said the agency was “removing the burdensome Biden-era regulations that have stifled energy and mineral development to revitalize rural communities and reaffirm America’s role as a global energy powerhouse.”
In December, the Forest Service first announced their intention to ban oil,gas, and geothermal leasing on about 264,000 acres of public land in the Ruby Mountains for up to 20 years. That directive has now been reversed by Trump appointed USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins.
As part of the directive, the agency also canceled plans to withdraw about 165,000 acres of public land in New Mexico’s Upper Pecos River Watershed from mining and geothermal leasing, according to the USDA.
Signs that the proposed ban was in trouble started on Feb. 14, when federal land managers in Nevada canceled a public meeting for the proposed oil and gas leasing ban on the same day thousands of federal workers were indiscriminately fired, including more than a dozen National Park Service employees in Nevada. 
Nevada’s Ruby Mountains have been targeted by Trump in the past. During Trump’s first term, his administration proposed auctioning off more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada for oil and gas drilling leases, including about 54,000 acres in the Ruby Mountains.
In response, Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto has pushed several versions of a bill that would withdraw about 450,000 acres of land adjacent to the Ruby Mountain from oil and gas leasing, but not mining.
Sometimes called “Nevada’s Swiss Alps” the Ruby Mountains in Elko County are the ancestral homelands of the Te-Moak Tribe of the Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada. The Ruby Lake National Wildlife Refuge also includes a wetland oasis for migratory waterfowl in the Pacific Flyway and fisheries that include trout and largemouth bass, attracting hunters, anglers, birdwatchers and other recreational tourists. 
Nevada has seen something of an oil and gas leasing boom in recent years, with the Interior Department putting hundreds of thousands of acres on the block for lease. However, oil and gas production in Nevada has always been negligible, and both industry and environmentalists remain skeptical that significant production in Nevada will make economic sense any time soon.
Over 90 percent of public lands managed by the Interior Department in Nevada are available to be leased for oil and gas drilling. Once leased, public lands are locked up from being managed for multiple uses such as outdoor recreation and conservation for the life of the lease, which could be 10, 20 or even 30 years.
Forestry land open to timber production
The Ruby Mountains reversal comes as the Forest Service announced Friday that the agency plans to open nearly 43 million acres of National Forest System land to timber production. 
The Forest Service said another 112 million acres of National Forest System land would be listed for culling to reduce wildfire risk, or 59% of all National Forest System land. The Ruby Mountains are included in the 112 million acres of National Forestry System slated for wildfire fuel reduction, according to a USDA map.
The secretarial memo comes on the heels of Trump’s executive order to expand American timber production by 25%. The memo directs federal employees to increase timber outputs, simplify permitting, and remove National Environmental Policy Act processes.
““I am proud to follow the bold leadership of President Trump by empowering forest managers to reduce constraints and minimize the risks of fire, insects, and disease so that we can strengthen the American timber industry and further enrich our forests with the resources they need to thrive,” Rollins said in a statement Friday.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ruby-mountains-snowy-tho-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-04-04 20:04:56.095190

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia RecorderFormer Albany Herald business reporter Bárbara Rivera Holmes became the first Hispanic woman to hold a statewide executive office position when she was sworn in Friday as state labor commissioner.
During Friday’s swearing-in ceremony, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp trumpeted Holmes’ groundbreaking accomplishment becoming Georgia’s first Hispanic woman to become a constitutional officer. The former news reporter resigned as president and CEO of the Albany Area Chamber of Commerce after being selected by Kemp to fill the remaining term of former Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson, who died in November following an eight-month battle with pancreatic cancer.
“Like I said last month when we announced the appointment of Bárbara Rivera Holmes to this position, I said that she was smart, accomplished and dedicated to growing opportunities for hard working Georgians,” Kemp said. “She also brings unique experience in economic development, especially in rural parts of our state, and education at the highest levels in our state will benefit all those who are looking for work.”
Holmes will begin leading the Georgia Department of Labor amid rising fears of a recession as President Donald Trump’s administration levies historic tariffs that critics argue could raise the price of U.S. goods while disrupting the global economy.
Her predecessor, Thompson, spent a decade in the Senate prior to becoming labor commissioner in 2023, taking over a state agency that had struggled to process a surge of unemployment claims since the start of the pandemic.
Late Georgia Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson honored by state senators for his service

On Friday, Holmes credited her family’s sacrifices that included her grandparents in 1961 seeking political refuge from Cuba in America as the driving force in her becoming the state’s 11th labor commissioner.
Holmes said Friday that she plans to run for a four-year term as labor commissioner when her current term ends in the 2026 election year.
“The Department of Labor is vital to our state’s economy for supporting workforce development, job attainment, safe working conditions and the prosperity of our communities,” she said.

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline)Two bills that would strengthen protections for transgender people and gender-affirming care won preliminary approval in the Colorado House on Friday.
They come as transgender rights and protections are put on shaky ground at the federal level under the Trump administration, which has issued orders to recognize only two unchangeable genders, stop offering non-binary passport gender markers, and attempts to stop funding care for transgender minors.
“What’s happening at the federal level is casting a long shadow and we don’t know what the future holds. There is a real possibility that gender-affirming care could be at risk,” said Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat and the Legislature’s only transgender member. “Passing this bill is about telling Coloradans that no, we are not going to let that happen. It’s about taking control of what we can do to ensure that our friends and neighbors and family members continue to get the care they need regardless of what might happen in the future.”
As more states enact policy to restrict care, especially for minors, Colorado could further become an island of access and absorb more out-of-state patients.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
House Bill 25-1309, sponsored by Titone, would codify into state law existing state public health rules about gender-affirming health care coverage. It would make it illegal for health insurers to deny or limit care deemed medically necessary by a doctor, which could include hormone therapy and procedures like facial surgery, breast augmentations and genital reconstruction.
“What can be created by rules can also be undone,” said bill sponsor Rep. Kyle Brown, a Louisville Democrat. “This bill codifies existing standards into statute to provide long-term stability and clarity for patients.”
The bill would also exempt prescriptions for testosterone from the state’s Prescription Drug Use Monitoring Program, which shares data across pharmacies and providers to mitigate abuse of controlled substances.
Republicans offered a failed amendment during the chamber’s two-hour debate on the bill to limit covered care to adults only, arguing that minors are not mentally developed enough to make such medical decisions. They pointed to Colorado laws that place age restrictions on other behavior like buying firearms and getting a tattoo.
“You can’t even buy a betta fish until you’re 18. But we’re going to allow (doctors) to perform lifelong sterility based with no (Food and Drug Administration) approval and no systematic review,” said Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican.
“If you’re an adult, make your own decision. But for the love of humanity, protect the children who don’t understand that these things are not FDA approved or haven’t been reviewed by any research. Let these children go through puberty,” she said.
The FDA has approved puberty blockers for precocious puberty. The medication’s use is considered off-label for youth gender-affirming care, but it has been standard care for decades.
Democrats responded that decisions about gender-affirming health care for transgender children are made between the patient, their families and their doctor. Leading medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend that gender-diverse children have access to developmentally-appropriate care.
“I think we should consult everyone in the equation, especially the person the care is being directed to,” Titone said.
Schools and courts
The other bill, House Bill 25-1312, aims to add protections for transgender people in schools and courts. It would require courts to consider as a form of coercive control actions like deadnaming — using a transgender person’s previous name before transitioning in order to reject their identity — and misgendering in child custody decisions. It would also shield parents who help their child obtain gender-affirming care from court orders in other states that outlaw the practice.
“Supporting a child’s gender identity is indeed in the best interest of the child, and that support cannot be used against a loving and supportive parent in a dispute,” said bill sponsor Rep. Rebekah Stewart, a Lakewood Democrat.
But Republicans argued the bill’s provisions for custody decisions would be an “erosion” on parental rights.
“The idea that misgendering your own child is considered coercive control, which is another word for child abuse, because you want to get your child help instead of affirming their delusions … this is the most disgusting bill I’ve seen so far,” said Rep. Jarvis Caldwell, a Colorado Springs Republican.
The bill would also label deadnaming and misgendering as discriminatory acts under the state’s anti-discrimination law.
Schools could not adopt a gender-based dress code under the bill. If a school has an adopted policy related to chosen names, that policy would have to be “inclusive of all reasons that a student might adopt a chosen name that differs from the student’s legal name.” The Legislature approved a law last year that concerns students’ chosen names in public schools.
“This bill is truly the least that we can do. Frankly, I wish that we didn’t have to bring this bill, but the reality of navigating the world today as a transgender human necessitates it,” Stewart said.
Both bills still need a final recorded vote in the House before heading to the Senate. Democrats hold majorities in both chambers and do not need any Republican votes to pass legislation.

(Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)As expected, the Idaho Legislature wrapped up its business Friday and adjourned the 2025 legislative session after 89 days at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
The 2025 session was dominated by a series of tax cuts that also reduce the amount of state revenue that is available to pay for the state budget. 

House Bill 40 lowers both the individual and corporate income tax from 5.695% to 5.3% and reduces state revenue by $253 million.
House Bill 304 shifts money to a state property tax reduction fund and a fund to pay for school facilities. To pay for the shifts, the new law reduces state revenue by $100 million.
House Bill 231 increases the grocery tax credit that is designed to offset the sales tax Idahoans pay for food to $155 per year for everyone. To pay for the increased grocery tax credit, House Bill 231 reduces state revenue by $50 million.

Another new law, House Bill 93, provides a refundable tax credit for education expenses for families, including tuition and private, religious schools. To pay for the tax credits, House Bill 93 reduces state revenue by $50 million.

House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said the tax cuts were among the biggest, most enduring accomplishments of the year.
“We have over $400 million in tax relief this year,” Moyle said Friday afternoon.
“We touched income tax, we touched property tax, we touched sales tax and we did a good job of adjusting all of those in a downward trend, which is good for the state of Idaho,” Moyle said. 
Each of the laws reduces the taxes Idahoans pay, help pay down school bonds and levies that are paid for by property taxes or provides a tax credit. But to do so, those four laws reduce state revenue by a combined $453 million.
  Democrats say walking away from funding hurts Idaho 

Democratic legislative leaders had a different perspective on the tax cuts, saying that they worry the Idaho Legislature cut too much revenue and could stretch the state thin in the event of an economic downturn.
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, also said that to make room for tax cuts, Republican legislators walked away from grant programs and zeroed out a series of initiatives from Gov. Brad Little. Rubel said legislators walked away from $15 million from the affordable housing fund, $22 million for road and bridge repair, almost $25 million in home energy rebates that will now go to other states, cut a requested expansion of a rural physician loan repayment program, cut workforce training programs at Idaho colleges and more.

“These are debts that are going to be left for our children and grandchildren to pay with a shrunken pot of revenue to cover it,” Rubel said Friday. “This is the textbook opposite of fiscal conservatism, folks.”
In a statement issued late Friday afternoon, Little congratulated legislators on what he called “a productive 2025 legislative session.”
“America wants what Idaho has – safe communities, bustling economic activity, increasing incomes, tax relief, fewer regulations, fiscal responsibility, and common sense values,” Little wrote. “I thank my partners in the Idaho Legislature for working so hard for the people of Idaho. I am especially proud of the record tax relief, support for law enforcement, ongoing money for water infrastructure, additional support for rural school facilities and literacy, full funding for Launch, and the billions in additional capacity for roads. The list of successes is long, and there is still more we can and should do for Idahoans.”
 Idaho legislators united beyond anti-SLAPP law and created new media shield law 

While there is no doubt the 2025 legislative session was contentious and divisive, legislators from both parties did come together at times. 
On March 5, the Idaho House voted unanimously to pass Senate Bill 1001, a new law designed to protect free speech and combat frivolous strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP, lawsuits. Little signed the anti-SLAPP bill into law March 10.  
The Idaho House and Idaho Senate also voted unanimously to pass House Bill 158, a new media shield law that protects sources who provide confidential information or documents to journalists. Little signed the shield protections into law on March 27.
The Idaho Legislature also passed House Bill 445, the 2026 Idaho Department of Water Resources budget that includes $30 million in funding for water infrastructure projects. Following a 2024 water curtailment order that sent shockwaves through Idaho’s agricultural community, some legislators called House Bill 445 the most important bill of the 2025 session
 Idaho legislative session ran two weeks past nonbinding adjournment target 

This year’s legislative session was marked by a sharp increase in the volume of legislation that was prepared. According to data compiled by the nonpartisan Idaho Legislative Services Office, as of Friday staffers prepared 1,036 pieces of legislation this year – by far the most pieces of legislation in the past six years. For comparison, over the same time period in 2023, staffers had only prepared 861 pieces of legislation. 
Idaho legislators missed the Republican leadership team’s original adjournment target date of March 21 because the 2026 budget was unfinished and because of ongoing disagreements between leaders of the Idaho House and Idaho Senate.
Legislators nearly wrapped up their business for the year Thursday, when they passed key unfinished elements of the 2026 budget. But Senate leaders said they were short-staffed and the procedures required to wrap up the session would have kept them too late last night. 
Friday was the 89th day of the 2025 legislative session, which began Jan. 6. 
The 2024 legislative session adjourned sine die on April 10, after 94 days in session.

Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)As the Idaho Legislature ended the 2025 legislative session on Friday, lawmakers quickly passed a reworked version of a so-called medical freedom bill.
Senate Bill 1210 is the Legislature’s response to a similar bill Gov. Brad Little vetoed Saturday.
The new bill still pursues a similarly broad medical mandate ban, which would bar Idaho businesses, government entities, schools and colleges from restricting entry, employment or services based on requirements for medical interventions — like vaccines, medical diagnosis or treatment. 
Lawmakers spent much of Friday without taking action, as they waited for the House to attempt to amend the bill. The House amended the bill just before 2 p.m.
In the House’s debate over its new version of the bill earlier this week, critics’ main concern was that the bill would prevent workplaces from refusing service or entry to sick people.
That appears to be true under the bill. 
On Friday, the House rejected an amendment attempt described as a way to shield employers from liability if sick employees who refuse to leave get injured at work.

Despite this being the third iteration of the bill the House has considered, and despite the House’s amendments earlier Friday, Rep. Todd Achilles, D-Boise, said the bill remained “deeply flawed” and it keeps the same “overly broad definition” of medical intervention. 
The Idaho House passed the bill on a 44-23 vote at about 3 p.m. Friday. An hour later, the Senate passed it on a 27-6 vote. 
After passing both chambers of the Idaho Legislature on Friday, the new bill — which carves out exceptions for schools to send home sick kids — now heads to the Idaho governor for final consideration. 
When the bill is transmitted to the governor, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.

 How the bill works: Medical mandates include diagnosis, prevention or cure to diseases. Extends to entry or service refusal.

Under the bill, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.”
For businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — the bill bans requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services.
Idaho schools — private or public — including colleges, universities and trade schools would also be blocked from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.
The bill is cosponsored by Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend, and Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow.

Earlier this week, Beiswenger told House lawmakers the bill “prevents medical force, medical mandates. People can choose them if they want to, but they don’t have to if they don’t want to. You can ask people to leave your place of business. But you can’t force them into medical treatments like vaccines or other kinds of treatments.”
The new broader medical intervention requirement ban would expand on a previous Idaho law banning COVID vaccine requirements. 
In 2023, Little signed the COVID vaccine requirement ban law, despite its similarities to one he vetoed a year earlier, the Idaho Statesman reported.
 Bill emerged out of Legislature’s week of work to respond to governor’s veto

The bill came after a week-long, fast-moving effort by Idaho lawmakers to respond to Little’s veto on the original bill the Legislature passed, Senate Bill 1023. 
Explaining his veto, Little wrote he valued medical freedom but worried that the bill “removes parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy at school because it jeopardizes the ability of schools to send home sick students with highly contagious conditions,” including measles.
On Thursday, the Senate failed to override the governor’s veto on a 20-14 vote, falling short of the two-third support needed, Idaho Education News reported.
Senate Bill 1210, the Senate’s revised version of the original bill, succeeded over the House’s revised version, House Bill 472, which passed the House but never received a Senate committee hearing. 
The Senate’s version adds language specifying the school medical mandate ban provision is subject to various other Idaho laws that let school boards block sick students from attending, spell out parental rights, and more. The House amended the bill earlier this week to remove an exemption for day cares. 
On Friday, the House amended the Senate’s version to:

Include private and parochial schools as being allowed to block sick students from attending;
Bar state agencies from adopting regulations, including policy or administrative rule, that conflicts with the bill; and
Add a new section stating that “Not withstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, under no circumstances may a healthy person be excluded in a disease outbreak due to such person’s vaccination status.”

The original bill, Senate Bill 1023, was amended twice before passing the Legislature. The Senate’s revised version that passed was also amended twice.

 Republican lawmakers express optimism for Gov. Little’s support

Asked by another lawmaker in a House committee Friday morning about the bill’s chance of securing the governor’s approval, Foreman was hopeful.

“I won’t speak on behalf of the gentleman on the second floor,” Foreman replied, using a common phrase legislators use to discuss the governor’s office on the second floor of the Statehouse. “But I guess I would term it this way. If I was — no disrespect intended here — but if I was going to Vegas, I would have really good odds.”
Asked about confidence lawmakers expressed in the governor supporting the bill Friday afternoon, House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, said he thought “everybody’s in agreement and the issues are resolved.”
Later Friday, the governor’s spokesperson, Joan Varsek, told the Sun the governor’s office doesn’t comment on bills until Little acts on them.

Paul Thomas, R-Velva, speaks on the Senate floor on April 4, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill prohibiting cellphone use by North Dakota students during the school day failed Friday in the Senate on a 26-19 vote.
House Bill 1160, sponsored by Rep. Jim Jonas. R-West Fargo, would have prohibited student cellphone use from “bell-to-bell,” including class time and unstructured time in between classes for the entire school day. It would cover cellphones, bluetooth-enabled devices, smart watches and other wearable devices capable of voice, text and other data transfers between students.
Students would also have been required to store their devices in a locked box or pouch so they would remain inaccessible in between classes.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong advocated for the elimination of student cellphone use during the school day during the committee hearing. He argued getting rid of the devices would improve students’ mental health and academic performance.
Gov. Armstrong advocates for eliminating student cellphone use in public schools

Sen. Mike Wobbema, R-Valley City, supported the bill on the floor. He said school districts that have implemented a school day ban on phone use reported increased social interaction, more participation in club activities, improvement in academic performance and the return of conversational noise in the hallways.
“It is past time that we throw our young students a lifeline and put in place the tools to rescue them from the addiction of social media and other screen applications,” Wobbema said.
Sen. Paul Thomas, R-Velva, who voted against the bill, said school districts can already implement bans on phone use during the school day.
“We have communities that don’t allow cellphones in their schools and it’s working quite well,” Thomas said. “My concern here is, if I was a school board member, I would vote for this. As a legislator, I don’t think it’s our role to tell the school boards what to do.”
Senate Bill 2354 included the same language as the bill that failed in the Senate. But Rep. Dori Hauck, R-Hebron, a member of the House Education Committee, said the committee amended that version to include more flexibility for school boards.
The amended Senate bill would allow students to use their phones on field trips and only require them to be stowed away during instructional time, not stored in a lock box or pouch during the school day. She said the bill would also give school boards the power to limit or allow student phone use outside of instructional time, such as in between classes or over lunch.
“It gives the school districts a little bit more flexibility on what they can and can’t do and they get to make the choice, rather than us making the choice for them,” Hauck said. 
The House is expected to vote on that bill on Monday.
One of the younger members of the Legislature, 26-year-old Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, said she was able to use a cellphone with no restrictions while she was in high school. She voted against the measure because she believes the issue was best left up to local school boards.
“It’s not up to the state to control the local policies so I’d hope the school boards would come in with their individual policies on what works best for their schools,” Cory said.

Laura Kelly vetoed six bills Friday afternoon, drawing the ire of Republican leadership who promised veto overrides when the Legislature reconvenes April 10.
House Democratic Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, voiced support for the vetoes, citing concerns with power grabs, overreach and threats to public health in the bills.
Senate Bill 29 addresses the rights of the county or local health officer and others to prohibit gatherings of large groups for reasons of infectious disease.
“Taking away the authority of public health officials to prohibit public gatherings and issue quarantines when necessary for the control of infectious or contagious disease directly contradicts effective, evidence-based health intervention advice and would put the health and safety of Kansans at unnecessary risk,” Kelly said. “While this legislation is likely motivated by the politics coming out of the recent pandemic, it would cause actual harm in efforts to mitigate current outbreaks related to measles, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, issued a joint statement condemning the governor’s “Friday afternoon news dump vetoes.”
On SB 29, they said: “Fauci-ism — and its unconstitutional restrictions and dystopian rules — deserves to be on the ash-heap of history. This bill protects the right to assemble — think churches, funerals and weddings — while enhancing core due process rights.”
Kelly said House Bill 2217, which expands the scope of the inspector general to audit and investigate all state cash, food or health assistance programs, was unnecessary because a fraud investigations unit already exists within the Kansas Department for Children and Families.
“This bill also removes statutory protections for participants’ data and health privacy,” she said. “It makes no sense from a legal, policy or fiscal standpoint to make this change.”
Masterson and Hawkins said Kelly was ignoring an opportunity to protect against fraud.
“After the $700 million unemployment fraud debacle on the governor’s watch, one would think she’d learn from past mistakes and work toward ending waste, fraud and abuse in the welfare system — ensuring benefits go to the people who truly need them,” they said.
Senate Bill 79 bars anyone on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from buying candy and soft drinks with food assistance. Kelly called the bill “simply wrong,” saying it would make it more difficult for Kansas families to access food they need and would harm Kansas businesses.
“The waiver required by this bill is confusing and will cause problems for our grocers and small businesses. Under the definition in that waiver, Kansas businesses would be mandated to stop accepting food assistance benefits for protein bars, trail mix, and other food products many would consider ‘healthy,’ ” she said. “Meanwhile, items like Twix, KitKat and Twizzlers would still be eligible for purchase using food assistance benefits. It’s nonsensical.”

Masterson and Hawkins said studies show obesity is impacting children with low incomes the most.
“It’s disappointing the governor doubled down on her anything-goes approach to welfare,” they said.
Woodard said the legislation would harm low-income families “by limiting access to food, health care and more.”
“While Democrats have pushed for essential changes to improve childhood nutrition and reduce stigma,” he added, “Republicans have continuously blocked these efforts.”

House Bill 2291 would create a regulatory relief division within the Attorney General’s Office and established an advisory committee. Kelly said she supported the bill’s intent but had concerns about the lawmaking power of the advisory committee.
House Bill 2284 sets written policies to govern procurement of managed care organizations to provide state Medicaid services. Kelly said she supported it in its original form and supported a more transparent process. However, she said, amendments made it “unworkable.”

“Additionally, this bill is a dramatic overreach by the Legislature into the role of the executive branch, which is charged with administering and executing policy,” she said. “It also overreaches into the judicial branch by removing the courts from the process entirely and vesting that duty squarely with the Legislature’s ad hoc ‘appeals committee’ — a move that calls into question the very constitutionality of this bill by denying the rights of ‘judicial review’ to those involved.”
Masterson and Hawkins said the legislation would provide a more transparent bidding process for government contracts.
“Taxpayers deserve better than lost paperwork, backroom deals and made-up rules on the fly,” they said.

House Bill 2033 adds programs and services to approved at-risk educational programs, both Kelly and Woodard saw the bill as getting in the way of the Kansas State Board of Education.
The governor allowed House Bill 2101, which prohibits municipalities from adopting and implementing a guaranteed income program, and House Bill 2020, which requires a quarterly report listing the names, addresses and alien registration numbers of certain noncitizens who have been issued a driver’s license, to become law without her signature.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/241218_kelly-03-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-04 19:05:03.622722

The 27-18 vote went against the wishes of landowners gathered in the chamber and a committee recommendation. 
Supporters of House Bill 1258, including Sen. Terry Wanzek, R-Jamestown, said unreasonable setback rules threaten to shut down power line projects that benefit the whole state. 
Wanzek represents an area where a large power line is planned but a township rule says the line must be a half-mile from residences and threatens to make finding a route impossible.  
“Most of the time, I support local control,” Wanzek said. But he said the current situation allows a township board and just a few landowners to stop a major project.
“Sometimes the local folks go a little too far,” Wanzek said. 
Some bill opponents referenced the landowners who traveled to oppose the bill, both on Friday and in a previous hearing where they overflowed the committee room.

Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, said the bill was drafted to support a single project, though it would affect future high-voltage powerlines. Testimony in committee referenced the JETx project, a transmission line from Jamestown to Ellendale with towers that are 150 feet high. 
“Every time we use legislation to push something through, we poke that bear, and if it wakes up, the consequences will be far more dramatic,” Boehm warned. 
The bill gives the state Public Service Commission, which approves power line projects and related utility rate increases, the ability to determine that a local ordinance is unreasonable. 
The commission last year approved the JETx project in a split vote. 
The bill had the support of utility companies that argued restrictive zoning laws drive up the cost of power line projects and mean higher bills for customers.  
The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Thursday gave the bill a do-not-pass recommendation on a 4-3 vote. 
The bill had previously passed the House 86-7. It now goes to Gov. Kelly Armstrong.

The U4U parole program has not been terminated,” a DHS spokesperson told States Newsroom, referring to the Uniting for Ukraine program.Attorneys challenging the Trump administration’s pause of humanitarian applications for Ukrainians and Afghans, as well as the end of legal status programs for nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, filed a copy of the termination notice sent to Ukrainians in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on Friday.The notice, given on Thursday, instructs any Ukrainians in the Uniting for Ukraine humanitarian parole program to leave the U.S. within seven days of receiving the notice, according to court filings. “It is time for you to leave the United States,” according to the notice sent to some Ukrainians that immigration rights groups filed in court. “If you do not depart the United States immediately you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States — unless you have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain here.”The next hearing is set for Monday before U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.‘Numerous reports’ of erroneous emails“Plaintiffs’ counsel have received numerous reports throughout the day today that other Ukrainian members of the putative class—potentially thousands—have received an identical letter, including individuals with approximately two years left on their parole period,” according to the brief by Justice Action Center, an immigrant rights group.According to the brief filed Friday, attorneys with the Justice Action Center notified the Department of Justice attorneys handling the case. The lawyers said the response from those DOJ attorneys was “to say that they ‘have been looking into this’ but ‘don’t have any information to share yet.’”The Biden administration’s renewed work and deportation protections for 103,700 Ukrainians are set to expire on Oct. 19, 2026.Trump and ZelenskyyIn late February, President Donald Trump got into a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting at the White House, breaking with Ukraine and its resistance to Russia’s invasion more than three years ago.Former President Joe Biden’s administration created temporary protections for Ukrainians because of Russia’s invasion of the country.Trump’s history with Ukraine, which was at the center of his first impeachment when he halted security aid approved by Congress, and his friendly relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, have moved the U.S. further away from European allies who have coalesced around Ukraine’s fight for its democracy.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in early March denied that the Trump administration was revoking protections for Ukrainians.“The truth: no decision has been made at this time,” Leavitt wrote on social media.",,,,2025-04-04 19:05:03.622722

Chairman of the committee Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, told Idaho Reports on Thursday that his committee was “closed until next year.” Without a public hearing in the House, the bill cannot move forward.
The bill could have been run through another committee, such as the Ways and Means Committee, but that would be the decision of House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star.
Moyle told Idaho Reports on Thursday afternoon after that he was unsure how he’d move forward, as he was already hearing about amendments that some people wanted to make to the bill. Moyle said Skaug would need to return the bill for it to go to Ways and Means.
Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, sponsored the 2024 law and brought the bill late in the session after talking to stakeholders. It would clarify that a child may receive medical care if there is concern for “loss of life or aggravation of physiological or psychological illness.”

The bill would also allow care if a minor “is seeking health care or medical treatment … that is directly related to an allegation of a crime against the minor child or to collect evidence related to such crime when the collection of such evidence is time sensitive.”
The change comes after the original law left some health care providers with concerns that juveniles couldn’t receive rape kit examinations without parental permission.
Anthon has repeatedly said this was not the intent of the 2024 bill, and it needs to be amended this year.
The new bill also would allow first aid-related care in cases of minor injuries and illnesses, after some public school districts raised concerns in 2024.
Additionally, the new bill states that if a juvenile is pregnant or has a child, health care providers may provide treatment without parental consent. Heath care providers could also diagnose pregnancy and provide prenatal or peripartum care without seeking parental consent, as long as the care complied with Idaho’s laws banning abortion.
Other changes in the bill would allow juveniles to access services of the Idaho crisis and suicide hotline, or services to help those who are experiencing mental health crisis and present “imminent risk of serious injury to self or others.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Advocates thought hard-fought battles over the Development Disability Administration budget were behind them — then the Moore administration dropped a supplemental budget Wednesday that cuts a fresh $28.8 million from the agency.
After successfully clawing back more than $300 million from the roughly $450 million in cuts that Gov. Wes Moore (D) originally proposed in his fiscal 2026 budget at the beginning of the session, advocates said they felt “betrayed” by the new cuts in the waning days of the session.
“I feel like our trust has been betrayed, because we worked so hard to come up with something that was reasonable and workable,” Tracy Wright, deputy director for People on the Go Maryland, said Friday morning outside the State House. “We’re going to lose dedicated direct support professionals.”
Advocates are particularly concerned about what they see as a last-minute proposal to cut a planned 1% raise for service providers.
In earlier budget go-rounds, the Moore administration and lawmakers had fought suggestions from state fiscal analysts to reduce the 1% cost of-living increase for health care providers across state, including those who support people with developmental disabilities.

But with the cuts needed for the state’s latest supplemental budget, those DDA provider increases were back on the chopping block. Senate leadership indicated Friday the cuts outlined in the second supplemental budget are likely going to stick around.
“We need those changes,” Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said in a news conference conference Friday. “We needed decisions on that to actually get to the balanced budget. They’re tough, but we’ve got to get out of here with a balanced budget.”
The elimination of the 1% increase for providers would save the state $14.4 million in general funding, which also removes $14.4 million from federal matching dollars through Medicaid.
Advocates worry that developmental disability service providers that were already facing staffing shortages before the legislative session began in January will just see the situation get worse with the new cuts.
“These cuts would affect whether direct support staff get a raise this year, which may affect whether they stay or seek a better paying job,” said Ken Capone, an advocate with developmental disabilities.
The Developmental Disabilities Administration serves some 18,000 Marylanders, but was hard hit by proposed budget cuts earlier in the year. By working with lawmakers and organizing well-attended rallies at the State House, the development disabilities community was able to whittle the cuts down to what it called “survivable” levels.
But Mat Rice, executive director for People on the Go Maryland, said that he was “disappointed” that new cuts were being considered this late in session.
“This is a very critical time for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families,” Rice said. “We don’t know what’s going to happen at the federal level, and we were relying on the state to hold the line.”
With the legislative session scheduled to end Monday, and budget negotiations between the House and Senate getting firmer by the hour, advocates fear time is running out to restore the new $28.8 million cut.
“If I am being completely honest … I don’t see that as a realistic possibility,” Rice said. “It’s just so late in the game.”
But the cut still stings, even after hundreds gathered on at Lawyer’s Mall and many nights of working with lawmakers to find a compromise in the tight budget year.
“To Marylanders with developmental disabilities, we just can’t take the cut,” Wright said. “We worked so hard.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_apr4_dda_cut_providerincrease2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Over the past year, the board that governs one of Oklahoma’s flagship public universities has racked up tens of thousands of dollars in bills while eating costly meals, listening to live music and enjoying optional social events and other entertainment outside board meetings. 
In all, it has cost over $69,000 to host 13 Oklahoma A&M Board of Regents meetings, according to an analysis of over 270 pages of the receipts from the meetings compiled by Oklahoma State University in response to an open records request. That figure excludes about $11,000 in mileage reimbursement. 
When that’s factored in, it costs over $6,100 each time the regents meet.
Records show the OSU system and Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College shouldered the burden of those costs, spending over $45,000 on meals and refreshments and thousands more to purchase fresh flowers. They hosted “social” events, and even once hired a string quartet to entertain the regents. At one point, the total cost to host a single meeting at OSU’s Tulsa campus soared to over $13,000. 
The OSU Foundation, the fundraising arm of the state’s second largest university, meanwhile, chipped in to treat regents to a hospitality suite and help them pay for a “whiskey tasting,” receipts show.

The governing board has been under increased scrutiny since the abrupt resignation of OSU president Kayse Shrum in February. It has since signed a contract with a crisis communications firm with close ties to Gov. Kevin Stitt. 
Current regents and the board’s chief executive officer declined to answer specific questions about the expenditures. But the expenses raised questions about optics during a time when Republicans, including the governor, are pressing for greater efficiencies with taxpayer dollars and four of the five universities the entity oversees had tuition increases approved. 
An industry “norm”
But, former board chairwoman and regent Trudy Milner said the costs are not “exorbitant,” and are an industry “norm.” Milner resigned in February, days after Shrum stepped down. 
Republican Gov. Mary Fallin appointed Milner to the board in 2013 to help oversee the Oklahoma State University system, Langston University, Connors State College, Northeast Oklahoma A&M College and Oklahoma Panhandle State University, which combined serve an estimated 42,000 students.
Many of the regent meetings span two days, Milner said, with a dinner scheduled on a Thursday without any formal business. The official meeting typically takes place the following day. Milner said the dinners ahead of a meeting could include the regents and their spouses as well as presidents, representatives from other campuses, and community leaders. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXSome receipts indicate dozens of people attended the dinners based on per plate charges, but the records do not identify the guests.
After a dinner, the regents often have a bar set up with snacks at the hotel they’re staying at to “talk informally” for the “camaraderie of it,” Milner said.
While the receipts obtained by Oklahoma Voice do not reflect the purchase of alcohol, one notes that a bartender was hired at a price of $150 for a dinner on Jan. 25, 2024. Another record details a “Board of Regents Night Cap” with a “social” theme in December. 
Others reveal that the OSU Foundation footed the bill for cups and signage to facilitate a whiskey tasting for the regents as well as spending about $250 on personalized cookies, $900 in refreshments, snacks and other items, and over $1,200 for a “hospitality suite.”
The OSU Foundation did not respond to requests for comment. The foundation’s website said the private, nonprofit organization’s role is to “manage donor dollars to provide the most advanced educational opportunities to students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends of OSU.”
Recently, the foundation hosted an online fundraising event aimed in part at raising money to help OSU’s food insecure students. As of Friday, the foundation’s site said it had raised over $20,000 to help students. The fundraiser noted that nearly 50% of OSU students grapple with some level of food insecurity.

Milner said the universities provided meals and entertainment for the regents, but the entertainment usually came in the form of touring campus facilities. She said they once visited a shooting range at Panhandle State University. 
Receipts show in January 2024 that a string quartet was hired at the cost of over $800, at OSU’s expense.
Mack Burke, an OSU spokesperson, said in a statement that the ensemble was made up of OSU students that performed to “highlight our support of the arts and our students” which he said is “standard operating procedure” for higher education boards. 
Current board chair Jimmy Harrel has said he didn’t want to go to campuses besides OSU’s, Milner said. Since January 2024, records show all but one of the 13 meetings took place at an OSU campus.
Meetings are supposed to rotate among schools who share the hosting responsibilities so the cost is not on one campus, Milner said. 
“I think it’s been grossly unfair that OSU had to host it this whole entire year and then they canceled the Panhandle one in April, and I’m not really sure why,” she said. “But I think that’s been a burden, in some ways, for OSU. And I think it’s kind of been a slap in the face of the other campuses that they didn’t get to show off their campuses.”
Current regents don’t answer questions about spending
Harrel, a banker and rancher, did not return messages seeking comment. Stitt appointed the OSU graduate in 2020. 
Oklahoma Voice attempted multiple times to contact the 10 current and former board members who filed expense reports, but only Milner and Blayne Arthur, who also serves as the state’s agriculture commissioner, responded. Arthur’s office did not answer specific questions, but instead directed a reporter to the board’s chief executive officer, Jason Ramsey. Ramsey also did not answer specific questions about the spending but provided a statement. 
Regents are unpaid volunteers and their budget pays for their travel and lodging expenses, Ramsey said. 
Records show regents stayed at hotels such as the Atherton in Stillwater, the Mayo in Tulsa and the Ambassador in Oklahoma City. While records indicated they received discounted rates, the total cost of lodging topped over $6,000, according to records.
Records provided to Oklahoma Voice revealed that Ramsey also stayed in hotels, as did some staff. It wasn’t clear what the total cost was for the staff’s travel and lodging. The office lists an Oklahoma City address. 
The board rotates its meetings across the campuses it governs and the hosting institution’s president’s offices plan and budget the board meetings and related events, which can provide “engagement opportunities” with community leaders and other stakeholders, Ramsey said.
Burke, an OSU spokesperson, said it’s typical for presidents to host these activities at their own discretion, and they allow colleagues across the OSU A&M System to engage. The board does not request the extra events, Burke said. 
In many cases, “university facilities and catering services” are contracted to keep funds within the OSU System, Burke said.
Shrum, who headed the OSU system at the time of most of the meetings, did not respond to requests for comment. NEO, which spent over $4,000 on the meeting it hosted, also did not respond.
Politicians and observers react
Stitt, who has appointed all current members of the Oklahoma A&M Board of Regents and recently named his choice to replace Milner, said in a statement Friday that university presidents need to be “mindful of their spending.”

“University presidents are responsible for hosting the Board of Regents, and I get that these presidents want to showcase their campus and community,” he said in a statement. “But at the end of the day, I’m always going to urge the presidents to be mindful of their spending — because the last thing we need is higher tuition and constant requests for more recurring revenue.”
Gary Jones, a Republican, who previously served as state auditor, said he’s not sure that any of these expenses are in violation of state law, but the real test is how Oklahoma taxpayers respond. 
“Everyone has to look at and determine, you know, the circumstances. Who all is there, whether or not they’re being compensated in any other ways for the job,” he said. “If you take into consideration their time and effort and their expertise being volunteered to the state, the question is would most people consider a dinner or something like that, out of line?”
He said he wasn’t sure a dinner is out of line, but said alcoholic consumption could be viewed negatively.  
Rep. Ronny Johns, R-Ada, who serves on the House’s postsecondary education committee, said the spending is “concerning,” but that he didn’t know if it’s out of the ordinary. 
“As a regent, it’s almost a thankless job,” he said. “They do get reimbursed for the mileage and things, and that’s good. But there’s an argument to be said that it doesn’t have to be as extravagant, that there could be better ways to spend that money. But at the same time, when you have the regents on your campus you want to put your best foot forward and showcase your campus.”
But despite being concerned, Johns said he does not think the Legislature should step in and pass further regulations.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said regents need items like drinks and coffee, but should be cautious “in this environment” about what is considered reasonable when budgets are being scrutinized, she said. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
This is a public board, not a corporate one that represents a private company, she said. It should not be treated as such, Kirt said. 
Don Heider, chief executive of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in California, said there are many questions to weigh when evaluating these kinds of costs, including whether regents and university presidents are being “good stewards” of the taxpayer money with which they are entrusted. 
“And could the money be spent in a more efficient way on what they’re charged to do, which is overseeing these five universities?” he asked.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/11555DF2-1BA0-4CF4-8742-E9411D38A90E_4_5005_c.jpeg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Protests against U.S. President Donald Trump are planned for a dozen cities in New Mexico on Saturday, part of a mass mobilization effort at state capitals across the country and in Washington D.C.
The “Hands Off” demonstrations center around the message, “We do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies,” according to its website.
Rallies on Saturday will take place in Santa Fe, Ramah, Albuquerque, Taos, Gallup, Las Cruces, Portales, Socorro, Truth or Consequences, Los Lunas, Silver City and Alamogordo, according to a list of actions planned for New Mexico.
The Santa Fe action is being organized by Indivisible Santa Fe, a group of mostly women activists created in 2016 at the outset of the first Trump administration, and a chapter of larger Indivisible movement.
Santa Fe local Max Thurston, one of the co-organizers of the Santa Fe demonstration, told Source NM on Friday he joined the organization because he was looking for something meaningful to do in order to resist the Trump administration’s authoritarian attacks on immigrants, LGBTQ people and women’s rights, freedom of speech and the environment.
“You can feel really helpless and not that powerful when you’re looking at the news individually, so the whole idea of Indivisible is that it’s all about how we can organize, come together and resist this authoritarianism, fight for something we really believe in and fight for our values,” Thurston said.
Thurston, a researcher and PhD student in exercise science at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, said he was particularly affected by the Trump administration’s funding cuts for research programs.
“For me, it’s also a pretty uncertain, difficult time because I really wanted to be a scientist here in the U.S., ideally in New Mexico,” he said. “I believe in scientific institutions and, in a lot of ways, I felt like America had some of the best science in the world and now I don’t know if that’s the case.”
Thurston said there are now thousands of rallies planned for Saturday, and his group is expecting millions of people to show up.
“I think it’s true of all of the different Hands Off rallies all across the state and across the country that the movement is about bringing together a lot of different groups, really building a strong coalition of different grassroots organizations focused on lots of different topics but that all have the same goal of standing up against the ways the Trump and Musk administration is dismantling our democracy, our government and our future,” Thurston said.
Speakers at the event in Santa Fe are expected to include U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.), Georgetown University law professor Heidi Li Feldman and EarthCare Co-Director Bianca Sapoci-Belknap.
The rally in Santa Fe is scheduled from noon to 2 p.m. on Saturday outside the New Mexico Legislature, on the east side of the Roundhouse.
Thurston said the Santa Fe rally will include people from the National Organization for Women’s local chapter, New Mexico Wild, the National Education Association’s New Mexico branch and the Democratic Party of New Mexico’s Veterans and Military Families Caucus.
The American Federation of Teachers New Mexico and Youth United for Climate Crisis Action have also sent out emails to supporters this week encouraging them to participate.
Thurston said organizers picked Saturday as the time for the protests in part because of the urgency to the harms being done by the Trump administration and the uncertainty about what happens next.
“We stand up on April 5 so that we can keep standing up on April 15, and on April 25, and keep this movement going,” he said. “This is definitely only the start.”

Extreme heat at a Miami-area prison without air conditioning has subjected prisoners to cruel and unusual punishment, according to a federal lawsuit filed in October by the Florida Justice Institute.
Nearly three quarters of Florida prisons lack air-conditioning, and that isn’t going to be resolved during the sitting legislative session. But a pilot program proposed in the pending Florida Senate’s budget bill would provide much-needed cooling in wings of several South Florida correction facilities that provide re-entry programs for inmates.


Specifically, the $300,00 appropriation would go towards air conditioning units in dorm rooms of institutions where Horizon Communities Corp. provides its Faith & Character program, which teaches basic life skills and faith principles to inmates in several prisons in Miami-Dade County.
The idea started with prison rights advocate Connie Edson, who has worked for five years to try to give inmates relief from the scorching Florida temperatures.

In 2022, she teamed with Gainesville Democratic Rep. Yvette Hinson to implement a pilot program that tested large portable evaporative coolers at Lowell Correctional Institution in Marion County, Florida’s largest state prison. The project ultimately ended, with Department Corrections Secretary Ricky Dixon telling a legislative committee in fall 2023 that they weren’t the solution.
“These portable units and some band-aid approaches we’ve tried … even the [inmate] population doesn’t like them,” he said, referring to the noise and moisture that they create.
But that hasn’t discouraged Edson, and over the past year she connected with Horizon executive director Nathan Schaidt to work with legislators on creating air-conditioning units in the dorms where Horizon provides instruction. The appropriation was offered by Miami-Dade Republican Ana Maria Rodriguez in the Senate and Republican Jim Mooney in the House, who represents Florida’s southernmost district encompassing parts of Miami-Dade and all of the Keys.
Older volunteers
Horizon relies heavily on volunteers who average between 60 and 80 years of age and who could contribute more if it weren’t so hot in those facilities, Schaidt said.

“The issue is that we don’t do that work in the chapel, we don’t do our work in education, we go down to the dorm where the men and women live. And so when you start hitting the summer months, a lot of our volunteers, they have to bow out. They can’t go and sit for two hours in that heat trying to teach these classes,” he said.
Schaidt compares what takes place on a regular basis at least eight months of the year to a college class in which the air-conditioning was broken on a specific day.
“What would they do?” he asks.”They’re probably going to cancel class. It’s very unlikely that they’re going to say, ‘Well, you paid for this and you need to sit through here, even though it’s a one-day thing and we’re working on the air conditioning but you need to be in class today.’ 
“We don’t have that option. They’re going to be there. And this isn’t just classes, this is their daily life, right? The issue we run into is, if you add to their inability to regulate their emotions to their inability to focus, their inability to sometimes learn and just the basic environment. Now add to that the heat. It’s a battle. It’s something that you’re fighting with over and over again.”
Since it was created in 1999, Schaidt said, Horizon has worked with thousands of men and women who have subsequently left the Florida prison system and boasts of a 5% recidivist rate. He says that if those inmates could study in a more comfortable environment with air-conditioning, those numbers might be even better.
Meanwhile, Edson has her fingers crossed that what she considers a relatively modest proposal will make it over the finish line when lawmakers unveil their 2025-2026 FY budget later this month.
A report by the global consulting firm KPMG that was released in the fall of 2023 put the costs to add air-conditioning to all of the state’s prisons at $582 million.

According to data from the division, there were at least 8,791 confirmed victims of child abuse and neglect during the 2024 fiscal year, stemming from nearly 50,000 reports. Of those reports, about 22,650 met the criteria for a Child Protective Services investigation. 
At least 70% of the perpetrators were the victim’s parents, and an additional 16% were other relatives.
“Child abuse sees no economic nor political boundaries. It is a global problem that can only be addressed with community-level solutions,” Gill said in a statement Thursday.
In 2024 alone, Gill’s office filed 276 physical child abuse-related charges and 135 child sex abuse-related charges. Still, Gill said child abuse is often one of the most unreported crimes. 
Lawmakers passed a handful of bills this year aimed at prosecuting cases of child abuse, with bills increasing the penalties or widening the scope of current crimes to give prosecutors more tools. 
Lawmakers passed dozens of bills that add, increase, or enhance criminal penalties. Here’s a list.

That includes a bill that makes it easier to prosecute abuse that happens online, a bill that adds an aggravating factor if the child abuse is part of a ritual or religious ceremony, and a bill to increase the penalty for the most egregious cases, now defined as “child torture.” 
That last bill, SB24, targets “exceptionally cruel or exceptionally depraved” behavior that results in physical or psychological pain. If found guilty, the perpetrator could be charged with a third-degree felony punishable by a 10-year minimum sentence. 
The legislation was, in part, a result of the case of Norlin Cruz, a 6-year-old boy killed in 2019 after being subjected to what investigators said was the worst case of child abuse they’d ever seen. Cruz’s mother, Reyna Elizabeth Flores-Rosales, was convicted of reckless child abuse homicide, a first-degree felony, and three counts of second-degree felony child abuse. 
SB24, Gill’s office said in a news release, “came about as our office prosecuted the mother of Norlin Cruz.” Gill on Thursday spoke to reporters alongside a picture of Cruz, who he often refers to when talking about prosecuting crimes against children.

(Mark Cornelison | UK Photo)Some graduate students at the University of Kentucky have had their visas revoked, President Eli Capilouto said in a campus-wide message Friday afternoon.
In his message, Capilouto wrote that the Department of Homeland Security notified UK that the department was revoking some F-1 student visas. The president didn’t specify the number of students affected but said it was a “small group.” He said university officials contacted the students to offer information and support.
“The university will always comply with the law,” Capilouto said. “We also will make abundantly clear that our more than 1,300 international students and scholars are valued members of this special community.”
UK is “working to understand changing federal policies” that are affecting campuses, Capilouto said. UK international students are encouraged to direct questions they may have to the university’s International Student and Scholars Services center. 
The news at the Kentucky university comes on the heels of the Trump administration’s efforts to ramp up deportations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that the State Department has revoked 300 or more student visas. 
At the University of Louisville, President Gerry Bradley told reporters Thursday morning that no students there had a visa revoked at that time.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/220831Campus01.jpeg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

So it is very abrupt,” said Heidi Drygas, director of the Alaska [&#8230;]","The offices of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services are seen in Juneau on Friday, July 1, 2022. (Photo by Lisa Phu/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Health abruptly laid off 30 public health employees this week after the federal government canceled a series of grants unexpectedly early.
“Their last day of employment is today, and they found out — I believe — earlier this week. So it is very abrupt,” said Heidi Drygas, director of the Alaska State Employees Association, the union that represents 22 of the 30 laid-off employees.
The layoffs are believed to be the first round of significant Alaska state-government job losses caused by President Donald Trump and the arm of the White House named the “Department of Government Efficiency,” coordinated by Elon Musk.
Trump-ordered cuts have already had significant effects on federal government programs and nongovernmental organizations that rely on federal grants, but until now, state-government jobs had been relatively protected.
“I fear that there are more (layoffs) coming,” Drygas said. “I’m worried that this is the tip of the iceberg, and this rapidly evolving news story … is causing a lot of anxiety for our members, many of whom work under federal grants, or they work on a daily basis with their federal counterparts. It’s hugely disruptive.”
Alex Huseman, a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Health, said the federal government brought an early end to two major COVID-19 response grants.
Those grants had been expected to expire no later than 2027. The state’s current operating budget and Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s proposal for the coming year list millions of dollars in expected grant spending. 
“The amended notice of awards for the impacted grants now reflect an end date of March 24, 2025,” Huseman wrote by email. “The reductions in federal funding had an impact on 30 employees. The DOH is working with the Division of Personnel and the Rapid Response Team from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, in accordance with the respective union contracts and regulations, to assist affected employees.”
Drygas said the affected positions are spread across the state, and that as with any job losses, these cuts will have ripple effects in the local communities, since state salaries lead to local spending.
“In some of these smaller communities, there’s not that many jobs, and so it could have a huge impact, or a disproportionate impact,” she said.

Jeff Thompson present the House Republican plan for property taxes on April 4, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Lawmakers introduced yet another plan for property taxes this week, pitching a proposal to save homeowners $1.1 billion over three years. 
In comparison, homeowners would have seen nearly $1.3 billion in relief in 2026 alone under Gov. Mike Braun’s previous proposal. 
In the atypical Friday afternoon press conference, Rep. Jeff Thompson said that 93-94% of homeowners would see lower property tax bills than they would with no action. But the majority of homeowners would pay less in 2026 than they did in 2025.
“We have two main goals in crafting this bill: deliver immediate relief to homeowners and reform the system to prevent the dramatic spikes in property taxes that we’ve seen in recent years,” said House Speaker Todd Huston. “Our amendment accomplishes both.”

The amendment to Senate Bill 1, set to be introduced on Monday, isn’t yet publicly available. Once adopted by a committee, the Legislative Services Agency will release an estimated fiscal note.
According to the two Republican leaders, all homestead property tax bills will get a 7.5% credit in perpetuity, up to $200, based on a calculation performed after accounting for property tax caps. Fixed-income seniors will see an additional $150 credit while disabled veterans will get an additional $250 credit.
“Now, every single veteran and every single senior will get a benefit if they qualify,” said Thompson, R-Lizton.
But one of the biggest benefits for the average homeowner, Huston said, would be improved transparency for taxpayers, who would be able to assess their bills on a Property Tax Transparency Portal.
“When we do a rate-based and non-levy-based system … I think the normal Hoosier homeowner can understand what their bill looks like. It’s not some algebraic equation,” said Huston, R-Fishers.
The plan for property taxes joins a handful of other efforts, including one from Gov. Mike Braun, Senate Republicans, a House Democrat and a previous Thompson pitch. Each proposal has varying impacts to homeowners and local units of government, which rely on revenue from property taxes to fund public safety, infrastructure and schools. 
For instance, Braun’s plan would save homeowners the most money on their property taxes going forward but be a heavy hit to the budgets of school corporations, counties, cities and towns. Alternatively, plans that reduce that revenue loss have a small, nearly negligible impact on homeowner property taxes. 
 More details to come

It’s not yet clear what the total estimated impact of those credits will be to local governments. Thompson, the chief budget architect in the House, said most units will still see additional revenue but smaller increases than they would without Senate Bill 1.
“They’re still going to be gaining dollars. If I recall, it’s about a 5.6% gain (under) current law. This will roughly cut that down to a little over 3%,” Thompson said. “So they’re still adding more dollars, just not as many new dollars.”
But Huston cautioned that some units, depending on their circumstances, could see losses simply because of the “complexity of the system,” pointing to local referendums and debt.
Similarly homeowner tax bills vary significantly depending on a home’s value, the local tax rate and other factors.

“You could have the same home in the same county  — and built in the same year — and you’d have two wildly different property taxes,” Huston said. “… I wish I could stand up here and give you all the bare bone specifics. I’d love to know what my property tax bill is going to look like in ‘26.”
The proposed amendment would also “rein in” locally held debt, though it’s not yet clear how the General Assembly would accomplish that. House Republicans reported that the state’s 2,000-plus local units of government hold a combined $53.4 billion in debt. 
Such calculations will impact local schools, who would get a double-whammy revenue hit with the incorporation of Senate Bill 518 into the plan for property taxes. The current version would require schools to split their revenue with certain charter schools. 
Under the new language for sharing property taxes, which isn’t yet available, Huston said changes for schools wouldn’t kick in until 2028 and would be phased in over four years.
Thompson also alluded to changes in the state’s personal business property tax, including a “very, very slow, gradual phase down” for purchases made after Jan. 1, 2025.
 

	Will it be enough?    

It’s uncertain whether the plan will be enough for the Hoosiers calling for relief. Last month, hundreds rallied to push lawmakers to adopt a plan closer to Braun’s proposal, pointing to tax jumps in recent years during the economic fallout of COVID-19.
Democratic Rep. Greg Porter said that big business would still be the winners in a Friday press release, criticizing the plan for not addressing home assessments that increase faster than business assessments.

“With roughly $1.1 billion saved over three years and about 1.9 million homesteads, each homeowner will save an average of close to $575 from 2026 to 2028,” Porter said in a statement. “… With an average property tax bill ranging from $1500 to $3000, a yearly credit of only $200 will fail to make a difference.”
He also denounced the lack of relief for renters as well as an increased reliance on local income taxes for municipalities to backfill losses.
“Our schools will lose money, especially with Senate Bill 518 rolled into the plan diverting property tax dollars to charter schools so the state can pay even less. This plan encourages local governments to raise their local income tax rate, so you’ll get more money in your right pocket but have to pay more out of your left,” Porter continued.
Braun threatened to veto earlier versions of the proposal, citing the need for homeowner relief. Still, Huston seemed comfortable with the current package.
“We feel very good about the trajectory that we’re on and we will continue to work with our partners on this and figure out where the best place to land the plane is,” said Huston.

[&#8230;]","Senate Bill 394 would allow first responders to receive workers compensation benefits if they are diagnosed with PTSD.A proposal to expand Montana workers’ compensation to include post-traumatic stress disorder drew significant debate in the Senate before ultimately passing a second reading, 29-20 to move on to the House.
Senate Bill 394, brought by Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, would allow first responders to receive workers compensation benefits if they are diagnosed with PTSD. Much of the debate around the bill focused on its fiscal note and the potential for insurance companies to increase their rates. 
“When we pick up that phone and call 911, we expect these people to put their lives and their bodies and their families in harm’s way to keep us safe,” Neumann said. “This is the least we can do.”
The American Psychiatric Association defines PTSD as “a disorder that may result when an individual lives through or witnesses an event in which they believe that there is a threat to life or physical integrity and safety and experiences fear, terror, or helplessness.”
Neumann said Montana is one of a handful of states that do not have PTSD as part of its worker compensation legislation. 
Several members of the Senate shared personal stories about either themselves or family members dealing with traumatic events. Sen. Sue Vinton, R-Billings, told a story about her brother, who in 2012 was a volunteer firefighter in New York.
A man set fire to a house on Christmas Eve that year and when firefighters responded, he shot and killed two of them and injured two others. Her brother was called to the scene that day.
“Trust me when I tell you that my brother has PTSD,” Vinton said. “He cannot participate in family festivities on Christmas Eve anymore. He hasn’t been able to ever since then. It’s just a sad day. It’s a difficult day. And so I have seen this first hand.”
Opponents pointed to the fiscal note. The Montana State Fund did an analysis, which was included in the bill. The state fund estimates the change would add an additional $897,795 to the cost of the plan, though some of that would come from insurance carriers.
It was estimated by looking at other states that have passed similar legislation.
A technical concern was raised in the fiscal note as well, noting constitutional equal protection concerns as first responders would be in their own class.
“All other individuals are prohibited from such benefits for the same diagnosis,” the fiscal note read. “This would be true even if the non-first responder was diagnosed with PTSD based on events in the course and scope of employment.”
Opponents also questioned whether it was the state’s responsibility to provide help in this situation.
“I would remind the body that that’s not the government’s role to take care of everybody,” Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings said. “I mean, government is not your mama, government is not your daddy.”
Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, who worked with Neumann on an amendment to the bill, mentioned the class issue. He supported the bill and the amendment removed correctional officers from workers compensation claims, which lowered the fiscal note.
“Somebody mentioned that, why should we do this for a special class of people,” Usher said. “I can tell you it takes a special class of person to actually go, like the last Senator said, and go back to fighting fires.  But I can also tell you that it’s embedded in these people’s hearts to run towards danger, jump between you and danger.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_5465-Edit-729x1024.jpg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

Todd Young (R-IN) arrives prior to the Senate Republicans' weekly policy luncheon, in the US Capitol on March 25, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump unveiled another, broader series of tariffs this week, he sent markets reeling — and sparked bipartisan legislative pushback featuring Indiana’s senior U.S. senator.
The changes stoked enthusiasm among most Republican officials representing Indiana in Congress, while Democratic representation spoke against them.
Trump introduced additional import taxes with fanfare Wednesday from the White House Rose Garden, dubbing it “Liberation Day.” He said it would “forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn,” States Newsroom’s national team reported.
He held up a list of “reciprocal” tariffs purporting to charge other nations half of what they charge the U.S. But they’re actually calculated based on trade deficits — which occur when a country imports more products from other countries than it sells to them — BBC News found.

The day after, a Washington state Democrat and an Iowa Republican introduced the “Trade Review Act of 2025,” to “reaffirm Congress’ key role in setting and approving U.S. trade policy” — and on Friday afternoon, Republican U.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana signed on as a cosponsor.
The president would have to notify Congress of new tariffs or tariff increases within 48 hours in order to enact them. The notice would have to include justification, plus an analysis of the potential impacts on American businesses and consumers. They’d expire within 60 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution of approval. And Congress could end the tariffs at any time.
Young previously said the Trump administration “rightly takes the view” that it’s time to push back on “provocative trade activity” in a Thursday statement to the Capital Chronicle.
“While tariffs can be a useful tool, they also carry downside risk if applied without a clear strategy — especially for Hoosier farmers and manufacturers who need certainty,” he said. “I’ve consistently emphasized the need for greater clarity in our trade approach so that those directly affected aren’t left in the dark.
He touted his Leveling the Playing Field 2.0 Act then added, “My hope is that these efforts — both the strategic pressure of tariffs and the enforcement tools in my legislation — can lead to negotiated outcomes that strengthen America’s position on trade and the economic prosperity of our country.”
It’s also consistent with Young’s views that Congress needs to avoid ceding key decisions to the executive branch.
GOP Second Congressional District Rep. Rudy Yakym also referenced potential challenges in a Friday statement to the Capital Chronicle.
“I am in close contact with Hoosier manufacturers, farmers, and the Administration on tariffs,” he said.
“Indiana’s Second District is the type of production economy President Trump wants to see across the country, and I look forward to passing pro-growth policies that increase manufacturing and jobs to ensure our shared goal of a level playing field,” Yakym continued.
Full-throated support from others
But most of Indiana’s congressional delegation offered passionate support for the president’s tariffs.
“The days of other countries ripping off America and our workers are OVER,” Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Banks of Indiana wrote on X Wednesday. “Thanks to President Trump, it’s America First from here on out.”
Indiana Ninth District Congresswoman Erin Houchin, also a Republican, wrote the country has been “ripped off” for decades and that Trump is “rewriting global trade policy in America’s favor.”
Banks, meanwhile, celebrated when General Motors announced Thursday that it would increase production in Indiana.
“It hasn’t even been 24 hours and President Trump’s plan is already delivering for working families in Indiana in a big way,” Banks said in a statement posted to X.
Indiana GOP Third District Congressman Marlin Stutzman was also enthusiastic, writing, “The Trump Tariff Equation: Free trade + Fair trade = LIBERATION.” Stutzman, a cattle farmer, further applauded tariffs on Australian beef.

And as stocks plunge and economists fret, the Hoosier delegation has presented staunch defenses of the president’s tactics.
In response to gloomy predictions of higher prices and slower growth from the Federal Reserve, Indiana Fifth District Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz pinned the blame on former President Joe Biden’s administration — plus, “serious dependencies of our supply chain on foreign countries.”
“Congresswoman Spartz is working with President Trump and her congressional colleagues to grow our economy, boost domestic investments and diversify our supply chain dependencies,” spokesman J.P. Etchison wrote to the Capital Chronicle.
Democratic denunciation
The Seventh Congressional District’s Rep. André Carson, a Democrat, struck a different tone in his own statement about last month’s foreign-made vehicle tariffs.
“I support lower costs for Hoosiers, but these tariffs will likely jack up the price of new vehicles and used cars,” Carson said. “Automakers are already recovering from years of instability after the pandemic, and these tariffs will only create more complications.”
He said Trump’s first-term tariff attempts “didn’t work” and urged the president to “reconsider for the well-being of all Americans.”
U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan, also a Democrat, didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Neither did Republican Reps. Jefferson Shreve and Mark Messmer didn’t reply to requests for comment, while Rep. Jim Baird couldn’t be reached.

The individuals, who were charged with conspiring to launder money extorted from boys and young men using sexually sensitive images by Nigerian criminals, were all Americans.
After the sextortionists coerced the victims into sending the images, they would extort them for money that was sent to the five U.S.-based money launderers through online payment systems, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Western District of Michigan. The five launderers would take their cut, 20%, and send the rest to a Nigerian individual they referred to as “The Plug”, who took a cut and sent the rest to the extortionists themselves.
But when the extortionists couldn’t get victims to send money, they would demand other things. This was the case for 17-year-old Marquette Senior High School student Jordan DeMay.
In 2022, in a matter of six hours, the Nigerian extortionists managed to extort sexual images from the teen and convince him to kill himself if he didn’t comply with their demands.
“He was tragically tortured,” DeMay’s father John DeMay said during a news conference to bring awareness to the issue of sextortion in 2024. “He was convinced and groomed into sending an explicit picture of himself, which he did and when that happened, the extortion started. It was vicious, it was consistent, it was methodical and it was purposeful.”



The launderers who pleaded include:
Dinsimore Guyton Robinson, 29, of Huntsville, Alabama
Kendall Ormond London, 32, of Lithonia, Georgia
Brian Keith Coldmon, Jr., 30, of Peachtree Corners, Georgia
Jarell Daivon Williams, 31, of McDonough, Georgia 
Johnathan Demetrius Green, 32, of Stone Mountain, Georgia



The conspiracy offense carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.
In recent months, Andrew Birge, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, has brought attention to the problem of sextortion in the modern age, noting that it too often can result in tragedy, like in Jordan DeMay’s case.
And in reflecting on the launderers’ role in this sextortion scheme, Birge said in a news release that “these individuals helped and profited from this awful, heartbreaking scheme and so they now will face the consequences.”
The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation have been calling attention to the emerging threat of sexual violence online being perpetrated by utilizing sexually sensitive images to extort victims, also known as “sextortion”.

Measles symptoms can take one to three weeks to develop, but people can spread the virus even before symptoms develop.
(iStock / Getty Images Plus)The New Mexico Department of Health on Friday reported measles cases had grown to 54, six more since the previous report on Tuesday.
According to a news release, all but two of the cases are in Lea County, with the remaining two in Eddy County, and most are among unvaccinated residents. NMDOH said the state’s measles situation “is not a rapidly expanding outbreak,” but, rather, one in which cases have “been occurring steadily over time.”
Measles, a highly contagious virus, can be transmitted by someone four days before and after the onset of the rash. Moreover, in enclosed spaces, the virus can stay in the air for two hours after an infected person has left the space. Symptoms begin with: a cough, runny nose and eye redness before progressing to fever and rash, the latter of which starts on the head before spreading down the body.
Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccines, health officials say, provide lifetime protection, and are 93% effective with one dose and 97% effective with two.
Between Feb. 1 and April 3 of this year, 15,718 New Mexicans have received the MMR vaccine, which is nearly double the 8,472 MMR vaccinations administered during the same period last year.
“We are grateful for the response New Mexicans have had in getting their measles vaccination over these last two months,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “Without it, measles outbreaks are more likely to last longer and increase over time.”



People experiencing fever and rash should contact their doctors or emergency departments in advance so they can plan for your visit. Nurses staff the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) and can offer measles and vaccination guidance in English and Spanish.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/measlesGettyImages-1196157315-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)A Plaquemines Parish jury has ruled that Chevron Corp. must pay the local government more than $740 million, blaming the fossil fuel company for decades of damage to its wetlands.
The ruling is the first among several lawsuits from coastal parishes in Louisiana that want the oil and gas industry to compensate them for carving up swamps and marshland. Local officials contend the vast work related to energy exploration and pipelines has gradually exacerbated the natural depletion of coastal areas, making them less effective barriers against hurricanes.
Chevron has said it intends to appeal the ruling. It’s among several companies from which Louisiana parishes are seeking billions in damages for coastal land loss.   
“Chevron is not the cause of the land loss occurring in Breton Sound,” Mike Phillips, the company’s lead attorney in the case, said in a statement, adding that it plans to appeal the ruling 
Attorney John Carmouche, who’s representing several parishes in their lawsuits against the energy industry, has argued the defendant companies have failed to follow state law that requires them clean and restore sites as close as possible to their original state. Chevron and others maintain the law doesn’t apply to activity that took place before it was enacted in 1978. 
The jury’s award in the 12-year-old case is far less than the $2.6 billion Plaquemines Parish was seeking in the lawsuit, although interest will take the final award above $1.2 billion, according to Carmouche. 
Chevron also contests that figure.
The ruling in Plaquemines Parish has broader political implications in a state where oil and gas have long been an economic staple and a revenue source for government. Even when commodity prices drop, demand wanes or international  pressures affect how much Louisiana pockets from drilling, fossil fuel continues to be held in high regard by those in power.
But these so-called legacy lawsuits from nearly every coastal parish against Big Oil have impacted this dynamic to a degree.
Carmouche, who forced Freeport-McMoran to reach a $100 million settlement with 12 parishes in 2019, helped bankroll the campaign of Democrat John Bel Edwards for governor in 2015 and his re-election in 2019.
Current Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, also saw significant contributions from Carmouche and trial lawyers in his 2023 election victory. As attorney general, Landry chose to allow parishes to pursue their lawsuits against fossil fuel companies.
Landry also tapped Carmouche for a seat on the politically powerful LSU Board of Supervisors last year.
This is a developing story that will be updated.

Greenstein first served as health secretary under former Gov. Bobby Jindal from 2010-13. He resigned after Jindal discovered the federal government was investigating Greenstein’s role in the award of a nearly $200 million state Medicaid contract to Greenstein’s previous employer, Client Network Services Inc. (CNSI). 
Despite the investigation, the federal government never brought charges against Greenstein, and the former health secretary was never convicted of a crime, even after being indicted by a state grand jury. He repeatedly denied wrongdoing at the time. 
Five people who work for Louisiana’s health care industry told the Illuminator that Landry was seriously considering Greenstein for the health secretary job. At least four had knowledge of conversations taking place amongst the governor’s staff or state health department officials. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern that they could face retribution from Landry. 
The Landry administration declined Friday to answer questions about Greenstein, who could not be reached through his cellphone or text messages for comment.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
Greenstein would be an attractive hire for Landry because he has intimate knowledge of public health care financing, particularly Medicaid, and is well liked despite his legal troubles. Many people in Landry’s administration do not have long-term experience in health care accounting, federal Medicaid regulations or the state budget. 
On Friday, even Jindal praised Landry for considering Greenstein for the job. 
“Bruce would be a great choice. He has a great mix of private sector, federal and state experience. He would hit the ground running, and not need on the job training,” Jindal said in a written statement. “He would work tirelessly to improve health outcomes and control costs.” 
The former governor did not address the controversy surrounding Greenstein when he suddenly left the Jindal administration over a decade ago. 
While the federal government didn’t pursue a case, then-Attorney General Buddy Caldwell convened a state grand jury that indicted Greenstein in 2014. He was charged with nine counts of perjury for allegedly lying to a Louisiana Senate committee and the grand jury about the Medicaid contract. 
Those state charges against Greenstein were eventually dropped by Landry after he beat Caldwell in the 2015 election and took over as attorney general, a job Landry held for eight years before becoming governor. 
At the time, Landry’s staff said they didn’t think the state could meet the burden of proof to convict Greenstein. The prosecutor on the case, Caldwell’s son, David, left the attorney general’s office shortly after Landry beat his father in the election. 
CNSI, which changed its name to Acentra Health after a merger in 2023, also gave Landry’s campaign and a Landry political action committee $52,500 during his race against Caldwell, according to campaign finance reports. 
Greenstein, who pleaded not guilty in the state perjury case, initially said he had very little contact with CNSI as the company bid for Louisiana’s Medicaid business. But an investigation later revealed Greenstein had exchanged hundreds of messages with its executives. He also recommended state officials adjust the terms of the state Medicaid bid, which allowed CNSI to meet the criteria and apply for the work. 
At the time, Greenstein defended himself by saying his exchanges with CNSI executives were mostly personal and that he never took a bribe from the company. He’s good friends with some of his former CNSI coworkers, and the conversations were casual, he said.

“It never crossed my mind that my friends or my texts were with a company,” Greenstein told a grand jury in late 2014. 
After the charges were dropped, Greenstein went on to join President Donald Trump’s administration as the chief technology officer at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

In 2018, he left the federal government to become an executive at LHC Group, a Lafayette business that was, at the time, one of the country’s largest home health care companies. The company has since been sold to UnitedHealth, a national insurance company that also manages one of Louisiana’s Medicaid plans. 
LHC Group’s founder and chief executive officer emeritus, Keith Myers, is one of the biggest political donors to Landry, with contributions totaling more than $600,000 to his campaigns and PACs since 2017. Brach Myers, Keith’s son and another executive at LHC, is a state senator representing Lafayette. 
Though he was never convicted of a crime, Greenstein’s legal troubles cost Louisiana money years after he left state government. 
Independent of the grand jury investigation, Jindal canceled Louisiana’s contract with CNSI in 2013 on the grounds that Greenstein had inappropriate contact with the company during the state bid process. This resulted in CNSI suing Louisiana for wrongful termination, a legal dispute that dragged on for years until former Gov. John Bel Edwards settled with the company in 2016.
Before the case was settled, CNSI’s attorneys had sought depositions from several members of the Jindal administration, including now-Attorney General Liz Murrill.

When the CNSI contract was canceled, Murrill was the general counsel for Jindal’s commissioner of administration, Kristy Nichols, and involved in the decision to give CNSI the boot. 

Yet Landry has relied on Greenstein for advice on health care policy since before he become governor. Greenstein was one of 28 members on Landry’s health care advisory council after he won the gubernatorial election in 2023.  
If Landry appoints Greenstein to be health secretary, he will have to be confirmed by the Louisiana Senate to hold the position permanently during lawmakers’ upcoming session that starts April 14.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Greenstein-Pence-Trump-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

The change came after lawmakers unveiled plans to pass a bill establishing a universal no-phone policy for all Utah public schools.
That new policy is set to extend to schools across Utah, as a new law that bans students from using cellphones, smart watches or other emerging technology devices during classroom hours will take effect  July 1. 
A cellphone ban in Utah schools is closer to reality with overwhelming support in Legislature

In a ceremonial signature event for three tech safety bills, Cox, who has championed efforts to lower social media usage, especially among teens, said the bills have the potential to redefine the online landscape, not only in Utah but in the country. 
“I remember getting criticism two years ago for our first social media bills, that we were trying to be a nanny state, to take power away from parents. And it’s the exact opposite,” Cox said on Friday. “What we are trying to do is to give parents and families back the power over these destructive and corrosive apps and cellphones.”
During the event, Cox and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson ceremoniously signed SB178, the bill that establishes a statewide cellphone ban policy — unless any school board decides otherwise. They also signed HB418, which directs social media companies to have a common data infrastructure, and SB142, a legislation that would require Google and Apple to verify the ages of their customers before they make app store purchases. 
With these new laws, Cox said, the state is aiming to empower Utahns in the online world, which he said is going in a worse direction with artificial intelligence providing even more tools to expand social media’s addictive qualities. 
“It’s not just the anxiety, depression and self harm that I mentioned,” Cox said. “But it’s literally tearing us apart and the fabric of our country. It’s making us hate each other as we get addicted to the outrage that is out there.”

A cellphone ban is not done
Sponsored by Sen. Lincoln Fillmore, R-South Jordan, SB178 sets a statewide policy that prohibits students from using their cellphone during school hours. A few schools in Utah had policies banning cellphones, but Utah law didn’t set a default policy, which,Fillmore argued, was itself a policy through inaction that allowed electronic devices.
“(Constant notifications) turn school into, ‘I am constantly under the fear of missing out on what is going on in the virtual world apart from me, I’m surrounded by my peers and friends
in what is the most formative time in my life, and I’m focused on Taylor Swift,’” Fillmore said.
The bill does allow school districts to implement their own phone policies. An earlier proposal initially sought $4.8 million in one-time money to fund equipment, such as magnetic locking pouches for the phones or other types of lockers to store phones during class time. 



Let us know what you think...


 


However, lawmakers ultimately did not appropriate any money for the bill, with legislators expressing little appetite to pay for the equipment.
While the bill still allows some flexibility for local school officials to set their own rules, Cox said it’s one of the most important education policies approved in the state in the last decade. But, he said there’s still some room for improvement.
“We didn’t get ‘bell to bell’ here,” he said about other policies in other states that forbid phones during the whole school day. “I just can’t let this moment pass to say it is a mistake not to do ‘bell to bell.’ All of the research is 100% clear that ‘bell to bell’ does protect our kids so much more than going to recess and getting on your phones, going to lunch and immediately being back on your phones. So I hope we are not done here.”

An unprecedented change for platforms
Cox said Rep. Doug Fiefia, R-Herriman, made quite an impression for passing an unprecedented bill as a freshman.
With HB418, Utah became the first state in the nation to adopt a law requiring social media platforms to have interoperability systems, meaning having the necessary infrastructure so customers can communicate and share data from different platforms, just like how cellphone companies allow users from different carriers to call each other and carry their phone numbers even if they switch companies.
Utah’s latest data and social media laws could ‘change the world,’ Gov. Cox says

“It’s a shifting point. It is the turning point. It’s a moment in history where we choose people over platforms, families over profits, the greater good over an unchecked algorithm. It’s where we shift power back to where it always should remain, with the people with Utah”, Fiefia said about his bill.
Cox, who had already described the legislation as one with the potential “to change the world,” praised the bill again on Friday.
“I don’t think most people understand how groundbreaking this bill is. It is the first of its kind in the country,” Cox said. “And it really does have the potential to change everything, to break up the monopolies, to give us, again, back our identity.”
The bill takes effect in July 2026, which Fiefia said gives companies time to figure out how to achieve interoperability.

Age verification in app stores
Any first-year law school student learns that children can’t legally sign contracts, said Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, who sponsored SB142, titled App Store Accountability Act. However, every time a minor downloads or updates an app, they are accepting binding terms and conditions. 
“You might say, ‘big deal,’” Weiler said on Friday. “Well, these contracts … often (give) permission to collect their data, sometimes to access their microphone, even their cameras, to use their data, to sell their data.”
His bill isn’t about controlling content, Weiler added. It’s about contracts. 
The bill mostly applies to Apple and Google, which run the country’s two major app stores. Under the law, with some provisions set to become effective in May, the app stores will be required to collect guardians’ information, who will then allow any identified minor to download an app requiring a terms of service agreement.
Meta, X and Snap issued a joint statement supporting the legislation saying, “parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child’s age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way.” 
However, Kareem Ghanem, director of public policy at Google, one of the companies that will bear the responsibility to verify ages, said in a blog post that a series of legislative proposals pushed by Meta “introduce new risks to the privacy of minors, without actually addressing the harms that are inspiring lawmakers to act.”
Weiler’s bill, Ghanem said, opens up the potential for bad actors to sell the data or use it for other “nefarious purposes.”
“This level of data sharing isn’t necessary — a weather app doesn’t need to know if a user is a kid. By contrast, a social media app does need to make significant decisions about age-appropriate content and features,” Ghanem wrote. “As written, however, the bill helps social media companies avoid that responsibility despite the fact that apps are just one of many ways that kids can access these platforms.”

(Main photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)A central Iowa social worker accused of threatening his former employer with “revenge” and some form of an “attack” is now facing sanctions for alleged abuse and practicing while intoxicated.
The Iowa Board of Behavioral Professionals has charged Dakota Funk, 33, of Independence with practicing in a professional relationship while intoxicated and under the influence of alcohol; failing to maintain sufficient, timely, and accurate documentation in client records; physically or verbally abusing a client or colleague; and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the profession.
The board has not publicly disclosed any of the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges other than to say it occurred while Funk was practicing in Ankeny.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 28.
Court records indicate that in August 2023, Funk was charged with, and later convicted of, harassment. Police alleged he “sent threatening emails” to the BrownWinick law firm to harass or intimidate the recipients, and that he continued to do so after being contacted by police.
A week later, Funk was again charged with, and later convicted of, harassment. In their report, police wrote that Funk had recently been fired from Central Iowa Psychological Services and that he was then sent a cease-and-desist letter by the BrownWinick law firm, which was representing CIPS, due to harassing emails he had allegedly been sending his former colleagues.
In one of his emails, Funk was alleged to have told the recipients, “You are both stupid. Go ahead and put a no-trespass on me. It won’t stop me (from) getting revenge on anyone. I take my time. Be careful 10 years from now! Because I plan my attacks!”
Four months later, Funk was charged with assault. Police alleged that when Funk was being admitted to Broadlawns Medical Center on Dec. 5, 2023, he kicked a nurse in an incident that was captured on video. Funk later pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct and was sentenced to five days in jail.
Two months after that incident, in February 2024, Funk was charged with, and later convicted of, domestic abuse assault. In that case, police alleged Funk assaulted his husband while heavily intoxicated. He was sentenced to one year of probation.
A few weeks after that incident, Funk was charged with, and later convicted of, violating a no-contact order by sending text messages to the victim in the assault case. That charge led to Funk’s probation being revoked and he was sentenced to 30 days in jail.
Court records indicate Funk has two drunken-driving convictions, one from 2019 and one from 2023. In both cases, Funk was arrested after police alleged he ran his car off the road while intoxicated.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/therapist.jpg,,,2025-04-04 17:03:08.411647

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Yellowbud hickory trees are abundant in Iowa’s forests, yet few make use of the trees’ bitter-tasting nuts. 
Levi Geyer, owner of Fancy Twig Farm, is one of a small handful of producers in the country foraging, crushing and extruding oil from the nuts as a sustainable, locally sourced cooking oil option.
Geyer said modern farming is eroding the soil, polluting water, contributing to a lack of biodiversity and is not environmentally sustainable. “But hickory trees can be grown in ways that are compatible with sustainable landscape,” Geyer said. “I’m harvesting these nuts from forests … there’s no inputs, there’s no tillage, so far there’s no fertilizer.”
Making yellowbud hickory oil
Geyer’s process is labor intensive. 
From foraging the nuts to putting the caps on the bottles, he estimates 8-10 hours of labor go into each bottle. Plus, Geyer has spent years scouting out good nut-bearing trees and forming relationships with folks who don’t mind the occasional scavenger. 
On a recent sunny Saturday afternoon, Geyer hosted an open house to thank the area landowners who allow him to forage for nuts on their properties. 
One of those landowners, Clarice Faber, said she is amazed that Geyer is “willing to work so hard for a new product.” 
As evidence, her husband, Bob Faber, pulled up his phone with a video of Geyer during hickory harvest season, high up in a yellowbud hickory, shaking the tree limbs to encourage the nuts to drop.
  Levi Geyer served scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with his Fancy Twig hickory oil and crushed shagbark hickory nuts, to show off the flavor of the foraged nut oil. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Geyer has had some success using a tractor-attached tree shaker, but said it really only works under perfect circumstances where a tree is isolated enough that a tractor can fit in next to the tree. 
The same goes for more traditional nut rakes — they don’t really work to gather nuts in a wild, unkempt area, which is mostly where he forages. Geyer’s harvesting tools consist of his hands and a low crouch to gather the felled nuts into buckets and plastic totes.
Once the nuts are gathered and sorted, Geyer runs them through a machine to remove the outer, green husks. Geyer built the husker out of a barrel, rubber fingers from a chicken plucker and some screws in the bottom that crack through the husks. 
Then the nuts move into a grain bin to dry out. 
This is another innovation by Geyer who said the small group of hickory oil producers across the country share knowledge with one another as they develop the trade. He said others use drying racks for this process, but now a couple of them hope to try out his grain-bin method. 
  Levi Geyer shows the grain bin he uses to dry the yellowbud hickory nuts. Last year the grain bin was nearly filled with 500 gallons of the husked nuts. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Once the nuts have dried, he crushes them, checks again for any “bad nuts,” and then sends them through the oil press. 
The bitternuts, as they are often called, are the only hickory variety that Geyer said can “easily be cracked with your teeth.” The thinner shell can also go through the oil press, which saves Geyer the tedious labor of shelling the nuts. 
Other native hickory varieties, like shagbark and shellbark, are tasty to eat, but have much thicker shells and don’t carry nearly as much oil.
With his current setup, Geyer said he gets one gallon of oil for every 15 gallons of nuts. 
The final step before bottling is a centrifuge process to help remove any impurities in the oil. 
“This is the freshest, highest quality oil you’ll ever get,” Geyer said.
He described the hickory oil flavor as “rich and delicate at the same time.” 
There is little research on the health benefits of hickory oil, although early settlers believed it could cure rheumatism.

Future plans 
Geyer said this is his first “big year.” He gathered and pressed enough nuts to make 76 gallons of oil, which he plans to sell at farmers markets in Iowa City and Kalona. 
“As a farmer, I see my role as supplying staple foods to people in urban areas,” Geyer said.
He hopes to grow the business, but not just in terms of what he can bottle. Geyer said he sees hickory oil as a way for consumers to become part of the local food system. 
“Another problem we have is people being disconnected from their food,” Geyer said. “The other part of the vision I have is for people to go out, harvest their own nuts and bring them to me and I’ll press them.” 
He said this would make the product, currently sold at a premium, more accessible for lower-income families. 
“I want hickory oil to be something that people can access and use for their main food source,” Geyer said. “You take your family out and you harvest nuts for a day or two and then that’s all the oil you need for the year.” 
Yellowbud hickories are most easily identified by their fancy twigs, tipped with bright yellow buds. 
The trees are found in the eastern half of the country, including most of Iowa. The best time to collect is from September through November, when the trees start to drop the nuts.

Geyer said he forages on about 10 different properties and several public land areas where he has scouted for the yellowbuds. 
“Anytime I go to a wooded area I find at least a couple,” he said. “They’re very common.” 
Geyer has also learned about the nut trade from Kathy Dice and Tom Wahl at Red Fern Farm in Wapello. He has worked at the duo’s u-pick chestnut, persimmon and paw paw farm for several years. 
Dice said in his off time Geyer would search for the yellowbuds on neighboring public lands and forage what he could. “We’re so impressed with the work he’s doing,” Dice said. 
Geyer wants Fancy Twig to be as sustainable as possible. 
His long term goal is to run the operation without any fossil fuels. He’s also in talks with a tannery to see if the byproduct of the pressed nuts, which is full of bitter tasting tannins, could be useful in tanning hides.
Geyer recently received a grant from Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, or SARE, to explore different forest management techniques. Over the next year he plans to thin and clear certain forest areas of non-native brush and overgrowth through grazing, controlled burns and mowing, all of which will benefit the forest and nut production. 
He hopes to one day have a farm to plant yellowbud hickories and other species, but he still enjoys what he can produce as a forager. 
“For now, I haven’t reached the limits of what I can just find,” Geyer said. “And I’m still developing the processes.”

Aaron Dana testifies in support of prohibiting eminent domain on tribal lands before the Judiciary Committee on April 4. (Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)A bipartisan group of lawmakers presented legislation on Friday to prevent the state from being able to seize Wabanki land for public use without consultation.
For the past several Legislative sessions, leaders of the Wabanaki Nations have worked with lawmakers to try to overhaul the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act that has resulted in the tribes being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations.  
So far, sweeping change has failed due to opposition from Gov. Janet Mills, but the executive, lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders have successfully made some targeted adjustments, including expanding tribal authority to prosecute crimes last year. 
LD 958 represents the next area of focus, although an omnibus bill is still expected to be considered during the second regular session of the Legislature next year. 
Sponsored by House Minority leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) and bipartisan co-sponsors, LD 958 would amend the Settlement Act and the 2023 Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act — as the Mi’kmaq Nation hadn’t been included in the earlier act — to prohibit eminent domain, a protection already afforded to almost all other federally recognized tribes. 
“Much of our land contains irreplaceable cultural, spiritual and ecological resources,” said Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana, a co-sponsor of the bill who sits on the Judiciary Committee. “This bill ensures those places are safeguarded and are not subject to destruction or appropriation. Too often in our history, our tribal lands have been taken, divided and exploited under the guise of progress.”
The U.S. government can seize private property for public use, known as eminent domain, however that authority is restricted by the Fifth Amendment U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws.
Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), a co-sponsor who sits on the Judiciary Committee, questioned whether the bill is in conflict with the Constitution. It is not, Faulkingham, tribal leaders and attorneys explained, because the Constitution outlines when eminent domain can be exercised but not that it can’t be further restricted. 
“There’s nothing in the Fifth Amendment that prohibits a state from enacting laws that says we won’t do that,” Faulkingham said. 
LD 958 applies to land protected under federal law — trust and reservation land — but fee lands — private property for which the owner owns the title — would still be subject to state power of eminent domain. A constitutional amendment allows states to condemn individually owned plots within tribal reservations.
Maine has seized Wabanaki land from the start of their intertwined histories, as the state territory today had first been inhabited by the Wabanaki people.
One example of eminent domain those who testified in favor of the bill cited occurred in 1925, when Maine took land from the Passamaquoddy Tribe’s Reservation at Sipayik to build Route 190 without tribal input. 
In 1912, the state helped a paper company pursue building a dam in Grand Falls, which flooded 6,000 acres of Passamoody land and harmed native fish, said William Nicholas, chief of the Passamoquoddy Tribe at Indian Township.
“When we talk about the Constitution of the United States and how it affects all of us, the Passamoquoddy Tribe is still waiting for our compensation for 113 years,” Nichols said, referring to the impact of the dam. 
Since the 1980 Act, Nichols said he views the state’s efforts to build an offshore wind port as an example of attempted eminent domain. Though the effort has been effectively put on hold, Nichols criticized the state for not consulting the tribes when pursuing a “possible invasion of our ancestral waters.”
Maulian Bryant, executive director of the Wabanaki Alliance, a nonprofit created in 2020 to advocate for the recognition of the Wabanaki Nations’ inherent sovereignty, said the bill encourages collaboration, not conflict. 
“If a project can truly benefit the public, the State and the Tribes, the state should work with tribal leaders to find a solution,” Bryant said. “This legislation is a protective measure to guarantee consultation and mutual agreement before any action is taken on tribal lands.”
There is one component of the bill Wabanki leaders are advocating to amend. 
The bill stipulates how the money received for seized land has to be reinvested and how the Tribes can reacquire land with such proceeds, which Passamaquoddy attorney Corey Hinton criticized as a paternalistic process.
“It puts an unnecessary restriction on a federal process,” Hinton said. 
Tribal attorneys will be presenting proposed changes to the committee before the work session on Wednesday. The change will likely be to strike the language and simply point to the federal takings process. 
Prohibiting eminent domain has unique bipartisan support, as some of the Republican co-sponsors of the bill previously voted against omnibus sovereignty legislation and piecemeal changes considered in past sessions.
Faulkingham described the bill as consistent with his political ideology, describing it as a measure to protect private property rights. 
“I don’t believe in the process of eminent domain against anybody, anywhere,” Faulkingham said. 
Other co-sponsors include Republican Sen. Marianne Moore of Washington, Democratic Rep. James Dill of Old Town and Republican Reps. Jennifer Poirier of Skowhegan, Katrina Smith of Palermo, Elizabeth Caruso of Caratunk and Arthur Kevin Mingo of Calais.
Other piecemeal changes to the Settlement Act so far include establishing a formal Tribal-State collaboration process for policy making, allowed the Tribes to generate sales tax revenue from sales on their own lands — except for the Mi’kmaq Nation, though lawmakers are hoping to expand that ability to them with a bill this session —  and permitting the Tribes to handle sports betting. 
Another bill this session supported by Wabanaki leaders would allow the Tribes to expand gambling options through internet gaming, with 16% of revenue generated going back to the state to fund services such as substance use disorder and gambling addiction programs. But casinos in Maine are opposed, arguing such a change would allow the Wabanaki Nations to monopolize the industry.

With a court-ordered deadline looming, officials are backing a multi-pronged plan to recruit more attorneys and reduce the backlog of unrepresented clients.
After years of Maine failing to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney, the Kennebec County Superior Court ruled last month that the state must create a plan by April 3 to end what it described as a constitutional crisis. It also agreed to a request from the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine to start releasing defendants who have been waiting for counsel from incarceration if the state fails to provide representation. 
The ACLU of Maine has argued since 2022 that the state is in violation of the Sixth Amendment, which declares the right to a speedy and public trial and legal counsel, among other provisions.
With that deadline looming, the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services released its proposal Thursday, which includes immediate remedies such as better coordination with courts to keep an updated list of all defendants in need of an attorney, increased incentives for private and public attorneys to take on cases, and an appeal to district attorneys and the Maine Attorney General’s office to reconsider pursuing lower-level offenses, such as charges for drug possession or violating conditions of release (which make up the vast majority of charges).
As part of its long-term solutions, the commission also referenced a bill (LD 1101) passed by the Maine Legislature’s Judiciary Committee this week that would add five new positions within the public defenders offices..
Zach Heiden from the ACLU said at the public hearing on the bill that while it was critical in bolstering the state’s public defenders offices, it was not enough.
‘All hands on deck situation’
On Monday, the Kennebec County Superior Court will start setting dates to determine if people should be released, and what the conditions of release should be (for example, an ankle monitor, limits to travel, drug testing, etc.) 
Individuals who have been incarcerated for more than 14 days without counsel are eligible and if the judge decides a person should be released, the state will get another seven days to find an attorney before that actually happens, so a person could technically be incarcerated for a minimum of 21 days before release, according to the ACLU.
During the March 19 public hearing, Judiciary Committee co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland), who introduced the emergency legislation, described the need to urgently address the indigent defense crisis in Maine as an “all hands on deck situation.”
“I think there are two really big things at stake. One is the Sixth Amendment rights of these people who have been incarcerated, some of them for a very long time, without representation” she said.
“And the other thing at stake is really the rights of Mainers to live in a safe community. And in some instances, there are people who could be released from incarceration who would present a public safety threat.”
As an emergency measure, the bill will need the support of two-thirds of the Legislature to pass and immediately take effect. In the amended version that the committee unanimously supported, it would cost the state $3,341,394 over three years —  $254,860 in FY2024-25, $1,533,828 in FY2025-26 and $1,552,706 in FY2026-27.
“We have an actual crisis on our hands. And this is a very important piece of legislation that plugs a lot of those holes, maybe not perfectly …but we’ll address a very important situation,” said Rep. Rachel Henderson (R- Rumford).
“This is not something that’s possible without true bipartisan efforts and support.”
The number of adult criminal defendants waiting for state-appointed counsel exceeded 1,000 last December. According to the public defense commission, it fell 487 as of April 2 due to a combination of public defender offices and private attorneys taking cases off the list.
The state’s plan 
In response to the court’s requirements, the commission is proposing a strategy to reduce the number of unrepresented defendants and improve access to indigent legal services statewide. Some short-term solutions the state proposed includes direct outreach to recruit more qualified private attorneys, expanding law student internships and externships within public defenders’ offices, and developing a real-time shared system with court clerks to streamline and coordinate case assignments. 
To encourage attorneys to return to court rosters, the commission is proposing a five-case daily cap “since many attorneys state as a reason for not going on rosters for the fear that they will be assigned 20, 30 or more cases in a few days,” according to the document. The commission is also proposing reinstating geographic limits to prevent attorneys from taking on cases in multiple counties and having to travel. 
On March 25, Jim Billings, executive director of the commission, sent a letter to all district attorneys’ offices as well as the Maine Attorney General, urging them to reexamine charging decisions for lower-level offenses — such as drug possession, driving offenses, and violations of conditions of release. 
The letter asked prosecutors to evaluate each of their cases to ensure they can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and in cases where there are challenges with proof, missing witnesses, or other issues, to consider dismissing those.
The letter noted that nearly 90 defendants remain jailed without legal representation. 
“I do not make the suggestions in this letter lightly. No one wants us to be in this situation,” Billings wrote. “This is a constitutional crisis, but if we work together where possible to prioritize resources and make tough decisions, we can improve the way the criminal justice system is currently functioning in Maine.”
Another proposal being considered by the Legislature this session, LD 179, would help address the issue by removing from the bail code a charge if someone violates their condition of release. Maine is one of only six states that charges people with a separate crime for violating their conditions of release. In 2024 alone, there were over 5,400 such charges filed in Maine courts, according to Frayla Tarpinian, a former prosecutor who oversees Maine’s first brick-and-mortar public defender office. To compare, the second most common type of charge was 662 cases of drug possession, she said.
Maine’s current law is an example of excessive punishment, according to Abbe Smith, a Georgetown University law professor and director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic.
The ACLU did not comment on the commission’s plan, but will respond during a Monday hearing.

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A 24-year-old Bishopville City Council member is officially the Democratic nominee for a House seat that unexpectedly became available in January.
Keishan Scott, a councilman since first winning elected office in 2023, won by just 11 votes over Carl Whetsel, a retired chiropractor and former the Bishopville city councilman, according to Friday’s recount.
In the unofficial vote count for Tuesday’s primary, Scott finished with a 10-vote advantage. An automatic recount was required under state law since the winning margin was less than 1%.
Scott gained one vote via a provisional ballot when counties certified their tallies Thursday. Then on Friday, the state’s recount affirmed that Scott finished with 1,436 ballots, compared to Whetsel’s 1,425, said John Catalano, spokesman for the South Carolina Election Commission.
“It is the greatest joy of my life. I am elated,” Scott told the SC Daily Gazette Friday.

Whetsel said “it was a close race,” and he hopes the rural Pee Dee district will “have the best representation it can.”
The special election is needed to fill the seat vacated by Rep. Will Wheeler, a Bishopville Democrat who announced his resignation just three days into the 2025 session.
The district covers all of Lee County and parts of Kershaw and Sumter counties.
Lee County had issues with counting votes in November and the recount for a state Senate race that ousted Hartsville Democrat Gerald Malloy, who ultimately conceded ahead of his scheduled challenge.
Looking to avoid a repeat, the state Election Commission sent staff to Lee County to help out Tuesday, Catalano said.
Wheeler’s resignation left the rural district without a representative for this year’s entire regular session, which ends in May.
Scott will face Republican William Oden, chairman of the Sumter County GOP, on June 3. No other Republican filed for the seat that has been traditionally held by a Democrat.
There are currently 35 Democrats in the House. Republicans hold a supermajority with 88 seats.
Scott is optimistic he’ll bring that number to 36 for next year’s legislative session.

Four county sheriffs in Wisconsin have signed agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in recent months stating they’ll cooperate with the federal agency on immigration enforcement actions. 
Since March, Washington, Waupaca, Winnebago and Wood counties have signed onto ICE’s Warrant Service Officer program, which authorizes sheriff’s deputies to serve immigration warrants against undocumented immigrants in the county jail, according to an updated ICE list of participating agencies across the country. 
These four counties have joined eight others that already had existing agreements with the agency prior to the inauguration of President Donald Trump. 
In January, Tim Muth, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner these agreements were a method the Trump administration would use to find allies in its effort to deport millions of undocumented people. 
“What they do indicate is which are the counties who have already raised their hands and said, ‘we are happy to assist with deporting people from the state,’ and I anticipate that the Trump administration is going to start with that list and say ‘we know who our allies are in this in the state of Wisconsin,’” Muth said. “Let’s see if one: We can get more allies signing these agreements, and, two: For the ones who already have, let’s see what we can do to get them more active in this area.”
Immigrant rights advocates say the pre-existing agreements with ICE were hardly used under President Joe Biden, but under Trump they can be used to deport any undocumented person in the jail, even if they’re there for a low-level offense or before they can defend themselves in court against the charges they’re accused of. 
Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature have been pushing for more county sheriffs to participate in these types of programs, authoring a bill that would require counties to verify the citizenship status of people in custody for a felony offense and notify ICE if citizenship cannot be verified. It would also require sheriffs to comply with detainers and administrative warrants received from the federal Department of Homeland Security for people held in the county jail for a criminal offense.
Under the proposed legislation, counties that don’t comply would lose 15% of their shared revenue payments from the state in the next year.

In a Friday afternoon news briefing, Gov. Andy Beshear said the child’s death while walking to his school bus stop “sadly underscores just how dangerous the flood waters can be.” 
“My heart breaks for the family,” Beshear said while on a Zoom call with journalists Friday afternoon.
Frankfort officials said the boy was walking to the school bus stop when he was caught in the water around 6:35 a.m. in the Hickory Hills area. He was recovered around 8:45 a.m. 
More bad weather — flooding, tornadoes, wind and hail — are expected through Sunday across a wide sweep of the state.
“We need everyone to understand that all water poses risk right now,” Beshear said. “Take every precaution. That includes never driving through standing water, even if you think you know how deep it is.” 
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has approved the state’s request for an emergency declaration. 
“This is going to give us access to crucial federal support we need to help our people, and I want to thank the president,” Beshear said. “He has been responsive in every request we’ve made in a natural disaster, and his people have been supportive, professional and we’re grateful for them.” 
By the numbers 
About 3,823 people are without power and 300 roads are closed, a number that Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray said will increase. 
About 300 Kentucky National Guard members are either on weather-releated missions or ready for missions, as needed. 
Four urban search and rescue teams are ready to search for people, though there are currently no reports of missing Kentuckians, according to Kentucky Emergency Management Director Eric Gibson. 
The state has a call center set up for Kentucky Emergency Management: 502-607-6665. 
“At best, we’re halfway through this,” Gray said Friday afternoon. “One thing I want to really punctuate is that there are some places and some roads that we are not accustomed to seeing flooding on. Be prepared: it might occur on those roads.” 
Recovery will take a long time, Gibson said. 
“There is a serious flooding event still to come,” he said. “It’s going to be a long-duration event that’s going to take several days to see this water recede.”

In Paducah 
The worst of the multi-day storm is headed for West and Western Kentucky. Paducah is under a flood warning until Sunday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). 
The weather service said counties from Jefferson to Carlisle should brace for more rain, hail, high winds and flooding. 
“Severe thunderstorms with the potential for very large hail, strong long-track tornadoes and damaging winds are expected to develop over southeast Missouri early this evening and then spread through southern Illinois and west Kentucky through the remainder of the evening,” the NWS warned Friday. “The severe threat will diminish with time and eastward extent across the Quad State, especially after midnight.” 
In Louisville 
Louisville is under flood and flash flood warnings through Sunday and the Ohio River is expected to rise, peaking at 68 feet on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. For context, a week prior on April 1, the river was at 24 feet, according to the United States Geological Survey. 
In response, the city has five “floodwall-roadway closures” in place “to protect the city from the rising Ohio River,” according to Mayor Craig Greenberg’s office. 
“With more heavy rain expected for Saturday, the current forecast is for the Ohio River to rise above 30 feet by early next week, which will likely cause significant flooding in low lying areas near the river and other creeks and streams across Louisville,” Greenberg said in a statement. “The most important thing residents can do is avoid flood waters. Please sign up for emergency alerts, prepare an emergency plan for your family, and stay informed. Taking basic steps to be prepared can save your life.”
Safety tips

Find shelter during the storm. Have a plan to go somewhere safe if you need to.
Do not drive through standing water.
Never move a barricade meant to keep you out of standing water on the roadway. 
Keep a flashlight, shoes and cell phone near your bed while you sleep. Make sure your phone is charged and weather alerts are turned on.
During a tornado, get as low as possible — the lowest room in the home, under a table. Get under something heavy and sturdy to protect yourself from debris.
During a tornado, stay away from windows and doors.
Make sure weather alerts and other safety alerts are turned on so you get them on your cell phone.

House of Representatives (Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)The North Carolina House of Representatives passed a bill allowing for alleged squatters to be removed from private property without the opportunity to contest the claims against them Wednesday.
Notably, the proposal, known as House Bill 96, drew opposition from three Republican members, a rarity in a caucus that typically votes in unison on matters that reach the House floor. It was one of just two bills this week that received “no” votes from multiple Republicans, in this case Reps. Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke), Carson Smith (R-Onslow), and Sarah Stevens (R-Surry). The bill also divided House Democrats, with 21 in favor and 26 opposed.
While Blackwell and Smith did not elaborate on their opposition, Stevens said in a House Rules Committee meeting Tuesday that she feared a “tremendous amount of violation of due process” under the proposal, which allows property owners to call on law enforcement for the expedited removal of alleged squatters occupying a residence they own, so long as they swear the individual is not a tenant or co-owner and has made no prior rental agreement or payment under penalty of felony perjury.
Though the bill does not allow the property’s occupants to contest their removal during the action, it allows them to pursue civil action to reverse wrongful eviction and recover damages as well as creating steep penalties for landlords that swear false affidavits in the removal process.
Introducing the bill Wednesday, sponsor Rep. Steve Tyson (R-Craven) touted support from the North Carolina Realtors, the Home Builders Association, and other property and rental interest groups. He noted that the North Carolina Justice Center, which often defends the rights of tenants, did not oppose the bill, nor did the Conference of District Attorneys.
Tyson did not discuss the specifics of the bill on the floor, but at Tuesday’s committee meeting, he said it was unacceptable that such a dispute could be held up in court “practically forever.”
“Anybody can get a lease online now and print it out,” Tyson told the committee. “You can go somewhere online, find a copy of the deed to the property if you’re savvy and see how the owner of the property signs their name. And so, it puts law enforcement in a very precarious position.”
The only other lawmaker to comment on the bill Wednesday, Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) criticized the proposal as “circumventing the courts” and creating greater risk that individuals are evicted from their homes with no recourse to prevent it. She called to give the individuals being removed notice and to allow them to state their case to reduce the risk of wrongful removal.
“It has someone going before a magistrate with an affidavit and they sign their name and they swear to it and they give it to them and within 24 hours, law enforcement is supposed to remove any person that’s inhabiting that structure,” Morey said. “The Chiefs of Police are opposed to it and they do think doing something this expedited based only on a person’s affidavit in signature could put people in harm.”
Morey said that House Bill 966, a bill with similar intent brought by Republicans in the previous session, was a much better alternative. It largely created the same expedited removal process but with the key exceptions that a removal hearing would be held within two days of notice, allowing the alleged squatter to state their case and contest the claims against them.
“I think this is totally ignoring due process, safety of officers, and I encourage us to revisit it with an expedited process that follows people’s rights, so I encourage you to vote no,” Morey said.
Also passed Wednesday were bills reducing disclosure requirements for realtors, increasing the interval before red light violations take effect, and raising the penalty for sending sexual content to minors, among others.

Senate Bill 322, a priority for Gov. Greg Gianforte, originally would have pushed the exemption for business equipment up to $3 million — a tripling from the current $1 million on top of the tripling last session.
“It’s an awful big jump going from $1 million to $3 million,” said Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, in the Senate Finance and Claims Committee on Wednesday.
Flowers pitched bumping the increase down to $1.5 million instead, a change the committee approved.
Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, the bill sponsor, said that isn’t where he wanted to be, but any increase would help small businesses.
On the Senate floor Thursday, Kassmier said the reduction was a compromise, and the bill passed its final vote Friday 40-9 with bipartisan support and opposition.
Some senators had wanted the tax to go the opposite direction.
In committee, Sen. Forrest Mandeville, R-Columbus, said getting rid of that tax altogether would be fine with him.
Kassmier, though, said total elimination would “get real expensive,” and the idea was to give a break to smaller businesses, not big corporations.
The farming and ranching community spoke in support of the bill given the high cost of agricultural equipment — and Gianforte described the business equipment tax as a “tool tax.”
Opponents of the bill pointed out that the business equipment class has received significant and repeated breaks over the years, but residential property taxpayers are shouldering a greater burden of all the property tax payments.
In committee, Sen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, asked Department of Revenue Director Brendan Beatty how to justify the shift from the business equipment class to other payers.
“Is that just a casualty of business as usual in Helena?” Esp said.
Beatty said in the property tax world, there’s always a shift, but he said one thing that’s forgotten in the debate is the way the economy in the state has changed in the last five decades.
Montana used to have 42 sawmills paying taxes, he said. “We have six now.” It used to have gold mines and oil fields and a big aluminum plant in Columbia Falls, he said.
In the meantime, residences have increased in value and increased in number, Beatty said.

The National Endowment for the Humanities, which provides funding to humanities organizations across the country, is “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” Acting Chairman Michael McDonald wrote in the letter.
The letter cites a Feb. 19 executive order by President Donald Trump which the White House says aims to downsize federal bureaucracy.
Other state humanities councils have received similar letters from the federal government revoking their grant money.
The Department of Government Efficiency has recommended that the National Endowment for the Humanities reduce its staff by a significant amount, NPR reported.

Gerhardt said Humanities North Dakota will review its finances to determine how long it will be able to stay open. A lot of programming will have to be cut, she said.
The nonprofit’s programs — which include online classes, book talks, lectures and more — reached an estimated 24,000 people last year, Gerhardt said. During the summer, it hosts a civics education program for high school and middle school social studies teachers. Gerhardt said this program will continue.
“This is what makes it affordable for a lot of people, not just the elite who can afford to go to a program,” said Dina Butcher, who sits on the nonprofit’s board, said of the federal funding. “This puts it in the grasp of just ordinary citizens for these wonderful programs that are offered at a really low cost.”
Congress created the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1965 and appropriates funding for the grants.
Humanities North Dakota sent out emails this week asking its supporters to urge the state’s congressional delegation to restore the funding.
“My sense is that since Congress was the one that allocated the funds that go out to the states, that they should be the ones that claw this whole thing back again,” Butcher said.
Gerhardt said the nonprofit has been in touch with the offices of Sen. John Hoeven and Rep. Julie Fedorchak.
In a letter addressed to Hoeven, Gerhardt said Humanities North Dakota has an important role to play in helping to educate North Dakotans about civic life. For example, it’s planning special events to help the state celebrate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 2026.
“Our upcoming commemorative programming — including living history performances, public readings of the Declaration of Independence, and civics education initiatives — is designed to deepen public understanding of our founding principles and engage people of all ages in the
democratic process,” Gerhardt wrote in the letter. “Without continued federal support, much of this programming is in jeopardy.”
A spokesperson for Fedorchak said in an email her staff are looking into the matter.
“We have reached out to the NEH to seek more clarification on this decision, how other states are being impacted, and their approach to state grant funding longer term,” the email said, using an acronym for the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Kennedy Jr. and NIH Director Jayanta Bhattacharya as defendants, the attorneys general said since President Donald Trump retook office, NIH has delayed the review approvable process for grants that should have been awarded.The agency has refused to pay for multi-year grants that were approved under previous administrations, citing disagreements over race and gender issues, the suit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts says.Massachusetts, California, Maryland, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin filed the suit.NIH work ‘in jeopardy’The attorneys general in those states praised the NIH as “the crown jewel” of health research that has fueled medical breakthroughs and spurred economic growth across the country.“That critical work is now in jeopardy,” they wrote. “By law, NIH provides much of its support for scientific research and training in the form of grants to outside institutions. Since January, however, the current Administration has engaged in a concerted, and multi-pronged effort to disrupt NIH’s grants.”Starting last month, NIH sent “hundreds of letters” to research institutions in the states canceling grants that had already been issued. The institutions were told the grants “no longer effectuate… agency priorities,” according to the complaint.Those cancellations stem from three executive orders Trump signed on his first day back in office targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and recognition of transgender people. Agency leaders followed up with directives to pause related grants.The letters to research institutions declare “the grant in question has been terminated because of some connection to ‘DEI,’ ‘transgender issues,’ “vaccine hesitancy,” or another topic disfavored by the current Administration,” the attorneys general wrote.HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.Yet another legal battleThe department is also facing a suit from a wider group of Democratic states over the cancellation of other grants that were initially issued during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those states say the department overrode extensions of the grants and rescinded $11 billion in funding that has led to layoffs and work stoppages.A federal judge on Thursday ordered those grants to be temporarily restored as the case unfolds.",,,,2025-04-04 17:03:08.411647

(Courtesy Montana DOT)Every year, more than 3,200 Montana drivers are involved in accidents with wildlife, according to the state Department of Transportation. And every year, department maintenance crews and tribal officers collect more than 6,000 wildlife animal carcasses, primarily large mammals, from the state’s roadways. 
Data analyzed by State Farm Insurance shows collisions with wildlife contribute to more than 10% of all car accidents in Montana, making Big Sky Country the second-highest risk state. 
Speaker Pro Tempore Katie Zolnikov, speaking to the House Transportation Committee, said a recent survey showed that 70% of Montana drivers have been involved in a collision with wildlife. 
“That’s the problem that we’re aiming to fix with this, because there are many Montanans that are impacted by these wildlife vehicle collisions,” said Zolnikov, R-Billings.
Zolnikov introduced House Bill 855, to create a new specialty license plate for Montana drivers. The funds would be allocated to a new Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks account that can be used in consultation with DOT to research, design, build and maintain wildlife crossing structures, which can include overpasses, underpasses, culverts and fencing. 
The Montana House of Representatives passed the bill this week with just six votes in opposition. 
The big game and wildlife highway crossings and accommodations account will be funded through a $20 fee collected from drivers who select the specialty license plate, which will be designed by FWP. The bill’s fiscal note estimates that the plate could generate roughly $160,000 annually, based on existing donations associated with the state’s 203 other specialty plates. 
By establishing the special revenue account, which could also accept gifts and donations, FWP and DOT would be able to provide matching funds for grants that fund wildlife crossing projects. 
Chris Dorrington, DOT director, testified in support of the bill during the committee hearing and said it was the result of extensive coordination. 
“Wildlife, accommodations and associated fencing are very expensive,” Dorrington said. “Average simple underpasses are between $500,000 and $2 million, simple overpasses are between $3 and $10 million. The costs increase dramatically if you’re on multi-lane facilities such as interstates. MDT cannot meet future accommodation needs just with the current funding in place.”
“This bill is a positive way for the public to engage and show support for wildlife accommodations,” he said. 
Dorrington cited studies that show wildlife fencing, crossings, and associated structures greatly reduce wildlife collisions, including up to 80% for large wildlife overpasses.

Nearly a dozen groups testified in favor of the legislation, including wildlife and conservation groups, insurance companies, the Association of Montana Troopers and Enterprise Rent-a-Car. 
The bill drew no opponents.
Montana has more than 125 wildlife crossing structures in place along its highways, according to the MDT. That includes 41 structures along U.S. Highway 93 between Evaro and Polson, installed from 2009 to 2010 through a cooperative effort between MDT, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the Federal Highway Administration. 
The most obvious structure to passing motorists is the “Animals’ Trail,” a 197-foot-wide vegetated bridge that spans the busy highway near Gray Wolf Peak Casino at the southern end of the Flathead Indian Reservation.
In 2023, the CSKT received an $8.6 million grant through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act to construct a wildlife overpass spanning U.S. 93, within the Ninepipe National Wildlife Management Area.

Notably for [&#8230;]","Ballot envelopes sit in the Thurston County elections center. (Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)The Washington and Oregon attorneys general sued the Trump administration Friday over its executive order on elections that seeks to withhold funding unless states comply with dramatic rule changes.
President Donald Trump’s sweeping order, signed March 25, looks to uproot voter registration and mail-in voting rules under the auspices of eradicating election fraud. Notably for Washington and Oregon, the order seeks to prevent states from counting ballots received after Election Day. 
“The order makes it harder to vote, erodes public confidence in our elections and makes it more expensive for states to administer our systems,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said, “and most alarming, it would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Washington residents.”
The order tells the bipartisan and independent Election Assistance Commission to require documentation of U.S. citizenship, like a passport or enhanced driver’s license, as a prerequisite to registering to vote in federal elections. 
Over 9% of American citizens of voting age don’t have proof of citizenship readily available, according to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice. Americans of color are more likely than white citizens to lack on-hand citizenship documents.
Washington state law mandates that people attest to their citizenship to register to vote. Statute also requires state and local election officials to regularly review voter rolls to identify people not eligible to vote.
Washington is one of 18 states to count mail ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. In the 2024 general election, for example, election officials received nearly 120,000 valid ballots after Election Day that were postmarked on time. In the primary last year, officials accepted 151,000.
“This is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after Election Day, perhaps after a winner has been declared, to vote in person at a former voting precinct, which would be absurd,” Trump’s order contends. 
This could also impact ballots returned to drop boxes on time, but not immediately retrieved. Other states only accept votes they receive by Election Day.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Government Efficiency would review state voter rolls to ensure they’re consistent with the new federal requirements. 
In a press conference, Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs called the idea for the review “foolhardy and ridiculous.”
The order directs the Election Assistance Commission to condition federal funding on states complying with these new demands. States that don’t comply could also face action from the U.S. attorney general.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, argues Trump’s order violates the U.S. Constitution, which says states will decide election mechanics, and unconstitutionally infringes on the right to vote.
“The president has no authority to set rules for how states conduct their elections,” said Brown. “Democrats and Republicans in our state have worked together to protect and expand participation in our democracy, and Washington has a robust, safe and secure, voting system.”
The amount of money the state receives from the commission has varied widely year-to-year. Last year, Washington got $1 million, the lowest in six years, according to the secretary of state’s office. The order isn’t clear on whether the administration could also withhold other funding.
Washington’s lawsuit is one of several to challenge the president’s order. 
On Monday, top Democratic organizations and leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, filed suit. 
And on Thursday, 19 other Democratic-led states brought a separate lawsuit over the order in federal court in Massachusetts. 
Unlike other cases Washington has brought, the attorney general is not asking for a judge to temporarily block Trump’s election order.
“Temporary restraining orders need to be brought where there’s an emergency impact,” Brown said. “Because we don’t have an election pending in the short term, we did not feel like a TRO was necessary.”
Nos. 9,10 and 11
Friday’s lawsuit sets the stage for yet another showdown between Washington and the president.
Brown has now filed 11 lawsuits against the Trump administration since the president’s second term began in January. It is also the fourth this week, including a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over billions in canceled federal health funding. 
A judge on Thursday agreed to temporarily block the administration from terminating the grant funding.
On Friday, Brown also was one of the leaders of a new 16-state lawsuit against the Trump administration over disruptions to grant funding from the National Institutes of Health.
And Brown said the state was joining yet another case with 20 other states to protect small federal agencies focused on museums, libraries, minority-owned businesses and more. Trump has proposed dismantling them.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — For every hour Lisa Lee works caring for people in their homes, her employer receives $25 per hour. In 10 years of work, she has never gotten more than $15 per hour.
Lee’s employer, like all home health providers in the state, gets funding through Medicaid reimbursements for home care waivers. Under state law, providers have no requirement to pay care workers more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.
The portion of the reimbursement that doesn’t go to workers is set aside for administrative costs. That often means roughly half of what taxpayers provide for services goes toward bureaucracy instead of the caregiver, and that’s not right, said Maria Reyes, South Carolina’s organizing director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance.
The low wages are causing health care workers to flee the field for higher-paying jobs, at a time when South Carolina’s aging population needs more caregivers, not less. To stem the exodus, the state should limit how much providers can take from the workers doing the job, she said.

A bill introduced in the Statehouse last week would require providers to pass on at least 70% of their reimbursement rate to care workers. That’s $17.50 per hour at the current rate of $25 per hour.
Home health workers are tasked with doing whatever a person needs on a daily basis, such as bathing them, giving them medication or helping them move around the house.
Beyond that, health workers are often a friend and source of comfort for their clients, Reyes said.
“You’re not just washing someone. You’re not just feeding someone. You’re not just giving meds,” she said. “You’re that person’s person while you’re there.”
In 2023, the median wage for home health care workers in the state was $13.62 per hour, according to PHI, a national nonprofit that promotes care for the elderly and people with disabilities. For a person working 40 hours a week, that would equate to a yearly salary of about $28,300 per year.
There have been times when Lee, who lives and works in Camden, has had to choose between asking her boss for an advance to pay for gas or walking to her clients’ houses because she couldn’t afford to fill up her car’s tank, she said.
“I shouldn’t have to ask my boss for help,” Lee said, adding she should be able to pay for it herself.
Trying to make some more money, she took on more clients. But the more people she cared for, the less time she had to spend with each of them. She can’t afford to take sick days or vacation, since her job offered no paid time off, she said.
“These are the sacrifices I make because I love what I do,” said Lee, who declined to name her employer. “But home health care workers are neglecting their own needs.”
Sen. Darrell Jackson, the bill’s sponsor, credits a home health care worker with keeping his father alive for an extra several years two decades ago while he was in hospice at home. Knowing his father was getting the care he needed took some stress off Jackson and his family, he said.
But with low pay driving people out of the profession and into other work, not everyone gets that chance, said the Hopkins Democrat. That was why he sponsored the bill, which has yet to receive a committee hearing. He’s also pushing for a clause in the state budget that has the same effect.
“When you look at their average pay, it is pretty ridiculous,” Jackson said.
Families who can’t find a home health care worker often have to take on the responsibilities of round-the-clock care themselves, sometimes at great personal sacrifice, said Reyes, who lives in Columbia.
Her father qualified for a home health worker under Medicaid in 2022 as his health declined from congestive heart failure, but no local agencies had enough workers to help him, she said. Instead, her niece quit her job and moved from North Carolina, and her brother retired early to take care of him, Reyes said.
“The whole point of us applying for the waiver was for us to get a break, for us to have someone directly for my dad,” Reyes said. “Unfortunately, we never got the chance.”
Her father died while still on a waiting list for a worker. As of last July, nearly 20,000 people were on a waiting list to receive a waiver, according to the state’s Medicaid agency.
As the state’s population ages, the number of people looking for at-home care is expected to grow. In the next decade, the state is projected to need nearly 11,000 more home health care workers than it already has, which is more than any other health care job, according to the state Department of Employment and Workforce.
How many people can get services depends on whether the state has the money to reimburse providers for their care. The House’s initial spending plan includes $5 million to increase the number of slots available for Home and Community-Based Services waivers, which pay for home health care workers to take care of people.
Getting more people the help they need is great, Reyes said. But increasing the number of people eligible for a home health care worker without taking steps to improve pay and conditions for the workers will likely only make the problem worse, she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3741-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 17:03:08.411647

This partnership will allow officers of the Wells Police Department in York County to arrest people on immigration violations in the course of routine work, an authority previously reserved for federal agents.   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement [&#8230;]","Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrest a fugitive in 2020. (Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A federal immigration enforcement agency signed its first contract with a local police department in Maine this week.
This partnership will allow officers of the Wells Police Department in York County to arrest people on immigration violations in the course of routine work, an authority previously reserved for federal agents.  
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement signed this agreement — known as the 287(g) program — with the department on Wednesday, April 2, according to data ICE released Friday morning. Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam submitted the application last week and told Maine Morning Star her department received an email Friday afternoon from Enforcement and Removal Operations informing them it had been accepted. 
The data also shows a pending application from Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities. Police chiefs in both counties did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication. Some sheriffs in other counties told Maine Morning Star they are also considering signing up. 
This official agreement marks a shift in how local law enforcement in Maine is cooperating with President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement. 
Local enforcement so far has been disjointed. In the absence of such agreements, police have alerted federal agencies when questions of immigration status arise and it’s unclear if there are specific guidelines or protocol for when to do so. 
The agreement in Wells and pending application for central Maine are both for the program’s “task force model,” which is described as a “force multiplier.” According to ICE, the federal agency will train and supervise local officers so they can arrest people for immigration violations during their day-to-day duties.
The email to the Wells Police Department confirming its agreement stated that all participating officers must have at least two years of law enforcement experience and be U.S. citizens, and that the agency would contact the department to schedule training at a later date, Putnam said.
Putnam said she views the program as a chance for more training and a way to eliminate what she views as redundancy.
“We’re looking at it as a tool for us and for the officers on the road to help them do their job better,” Putnam said, “and be able to make arrests at two o’clock in the morning and be able to deal with it and not have to wait for what possibly could be several hours for an ICE agent to get here, because what that does is that takes time away from them doing their regular duties of patrolling the town of Wells.”
Conversely, Sue Roche, executive director at the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, believes such agreements hurt the rights and public safety of all residents by deterring communication with police.
Before Trump reinstated the 287(g) program, it was discontinued in 2012 after the discovery of abuses, including racial profiling, which Roche noted impacts people who aren’t immigrants, too. 
Roche said she has already seen immigrants — those with and without legal status — now afraid to share public safety information with law enforcement and argues that would worsen, to the detriment of all, if local law enforcement is working on behalf of federal immigration authorities. Fears of reaching out to local police can also give abusers more power to threaten victims who do not have legal status, Roche added.
While immigration is a federal matter by law, work on the local level is key. An estimated 70% of ICE arrests nationwide over the past decade have been handoffs from state or local authorities, and Trump’s former acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the president’s “mass deportation” plan won’t work without state assistance.
While 287(g) agreements expand across the country, Democratic legislators in Maine have proposed legislation to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies or officers from entering into such contracts. The bill has yet to have a public hearing. 
According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, only Oregon and Illinois have comprehensive state laws restricting transfers of people to ICE, while some place limits on cooperation. 
Putnam said she hadn’t been aware of the bill before submitting the 287(g) application but hopes Mainers have confidence in their local and state law enforcement officers. 
“These will be low frequency events but it enables us to act,” Putnam said of the agreement. “If us having this training prevents a dangerous person from being on the streets in the town of Wells in the state of Maine, then I think it’s only helpful that we have this training.”
Roche sees the Trump administration’s tactics as “broadly targeting all immigrant communities by pushing a false narrative that there is a link between being an immigrant and criminality.”
No such link exists, an assertion backed up by research, some of which has found the opposite, that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born citizens. 
“Local law enforcement handing over public safety resources to target our community members who simply want to live peacefully, work, and contribute to Maine will harm all of us now and for future generations to come,” Roche said. 
ICE did not respond to a request for comment regarding criticism of the 287(g) program or to confirm the signed and pending agreements in Maine.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  As the Iowa Legislature advanced past the second major deadline of the 2025 session, conversations on pipelines, Medicaid work requirements and new higher education requirements are continuing through surviving bills — though agreements have not necessarily been reached between the two Republican-controlled chambers.
The session’s second “funnel” deadline is another checkpoint for lawmakers during the legislative session, culling the bills that remain eligible for consideration as the Legislature nears the end of session. During the first funnel, bills were required to gain approval by a committee in one chamber to survive. In the second funnel, bills must have passed in floor debate in one chamber and gained committee approval in the other chamber to remain eligible.
There are several exceptions to this deadline, such as bills involving taxes, spending and government oversight components, and they include the property tax legislation proposed by Iowa lawmakers. Legislative leaders can also sponsor a bill and bring it forward without abiding by the deadline.
 In addition, the language of a bills considered “dead” because of the funnel can still be added, at any point, as an amendment to a surviving bill.
There are also several bills that remain eligible for consideration by being placed on the “unfinished business” calendar, allowing them to remain up for consideration during the remainder of the session.
As numerous high-profile bills were placed on the “unfinished business” calendar this year, House Speaker Pat Grassley said many of the bills were ones that “may be part of a priority, but we’re maybe not ready to work on.”
“I think our philosophy would be more, overall, if there’s bills that need more work, we can have that opportunity to do,” Grassley said. “That doesn’t mean that all of them will happen, but to just let some priorities just die because of the funnel process.”
Grassley said that he believes there are “still a lot of priorities that are lying out there that need more work” before lawmakers end session, but that he did not see the legislature as operating differently in 2025 compared to previous sessions.
Though the House introduced and passed more bills than the Iowa Senate, Senate President Amy Sinclair said the chamber was focused on ensuring bills that lower costs for Iowans and businesses and “make Iowa the best place to live, work and raise your family” are passed this session.
“Moving forward, those priorities that the Senate had at the beginning of session — property tax policy, working on health care availability — all of those priorities we had to begin in session will still be our priorities,” Sinclair said. “And we have bills that are live to make that happen.”
But House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said that GOP lawmakers have not been passing bills that improve Iowans’ lives or lower costs.
“Between the chaos in Washington, the chaos in the global economy and some worries about Iowa’s economy, Iowans are concerned,” Konfrst said. “They want to know what will happen to their pocketbooks. … Republicans have done nothing to help Iowa’s economy this session. So far, they have done nothing to help Iowans when it comes to their budgets and their pocketbooks.”
Some bills have already made it through both chambers to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk. The governor signed into law the bill removing gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act in February, and this week signed into law legislation banning the handheld use of cellphones while driving.
 School funding remains stalled

One of the major bills that has not gone to the governor yet this session is school funding. The legislature failed to meet a self-imposed deadline of passing the State Supplemental Aid (SSA) rate, providing per-pupil funding for Iowa public K-12 schools, within 30 days of the governor’s budget being released. Failing to meet this deadline has caused problems for schools in previous sessions, as school districts are required to publish their budgets in early March — deadlines which have already passed.
The holdup comes from differing SSA proposals from House and Senate Republicans. Reynolds and the Senate Republicans have supported a 2% SSA rate, but House Republicans have countered with a 2.25% funding increase alongside other spending components including a one-time boost of $22.6 million for per-pupil costs. The House amended Senate File 167 and sent it back to the Senate in February with its higher funding goals in February, but the bill has not seen action since.
Sinclair said that she believed that an agreement would be reached soon on school funding. She also added that one of the reasons for the delay was uncertainty about the state’s budget estimates for the upcoming fiscal year.
“We’ll get something passed out this coming week,” Sinclair said. “It’s important that we waited for the revenue estimating conference for March. We know that the commodity prices are down, and it impacts our overall revenues for the state – so we needed to see where that was, to see the number that’s going out for school funding.”
The Revenue Estimating Conference estimated Iowa’s revenue will be at $8.5 billion in fiscal year 2026, lower than the governor’s $9.4 billion budget proposal for the upcoming year. GOP leaders said they expected to see a drop in revenue due to the income tax cut that took effect in January and planned to make up for shortfalls using the Taxpayer Relief Fund.
 As budget discussions begin, impact of tariffs, federal actions remain unclear

School funding is the largest component of Iowa’s state budget, but lawmakers will begin discussing other appropriations bills on other state spending obligations in the coming weeks. 
As President Donald Trump’s announcement this week of sweeping tariffs caused major plummets in the U.S. stock market, Konfrst said that Republicans need to be “realistic” about the impact of Trump’s policies on Iowa’s economy and the state budget.
“We can’t play politics with Iowa’s economic outlook,” Konfrst said. “We have to be realistic about the impact of the chaotic tariff policy that’s happening, and we have to look at what that’s going to do to Iowans.”
Konfrst said Republicans should consider areas where costs can be saved in Iowa’s existing budget that are currently being drawn from GOP-supported policies like the Education Savings Account program, which will begin providing public funds for private school tuition and associated costs with no family income cap in the 2025-2026 school year.
“When Republicans are drafting their budget, they have to be able to understand that next year doesn’t look like it’s going to be much better, or, if anything, it’ll be worse … than this year,” Konfrst said. The Democratic leader called GOP lawmakers to consider, “What can we do to prepare for an economy that isn’t doing very well right now? Instead of just saying yes, this is all great, let’s cut more taxes to corporations, which is what Republicans seem focused on doing.
Grassley said that Republicans are drafting their budget using REC estimates, but said that he believed the state is in a sound economic position to weather economic hardships because of GOP leadership’s practices that left the state with a $2 billion budget surplus in 2024 alongside other reserve funds.
“I think that as a state, we’ve done a good job of making sure that we leave ourselves a cushion, you know, with an ending balance, with the Taxpayer Relief Fund, having the rainy day and a surplus full,” Grassley said. “… We’ve always talked about (having funds) for unforeseen things like, potentially, what the short-term impacts on this may be. That’s why we’ve budgeted the way we’ve had the last seven years.”
Before lawmakers move fully into the budgeting process, there are still many policy proposals left to be debated. Here is a rundown on the bills that remain on the table following the second funnel deadline – and which bills did not make the cut.
 
 Bills that survived

 
 Agriculture

Grain indemnity: House File 508, would increase the grain indemnity fund maximum to $16 million to cover farmers’ losses when their buyers go broke and would allow farmers with credit-sale contracts to partake in the fund’s protections. HF 508 advanced through the second funnel as a committee bill from the House Ways and Means Committee. 
A grain indemnity bill in the Senate, would only increase the fund to a $12 million maximum and would also include credit-sale contracts. Senate File 608 was placed on the calendar under unfinished business.
Reducing nitrogen fertilizer: House File 942, aims to reduce the statewide average use of commercial nitrogen fertilizers by 15% with the creation of a pilot program in the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. The bill, formerly House Study Bill 165, advanced to the House Appropriations Committee which is excluded from funnel deadlines.
Drones: Senate File 491 would prohibit remote-piloted aircraft from flying over a “farmstead” or within 400 feet of farm animals, farm equipment or structures. Senators advanced the bill to the House where it is now eligible for floor debate. 
 Education

Absence exception for religious instruction: House File 870, passed unanimously out of the Iowa Senate Education Committee in late March, would alter state attendance laws to exempt students attending religious instruction. 
Bullying definition: Current Iowa Code defines bullying and harassment as actions or conduct toward a student that target them based on real or perceived traits, listing characteristics like race, religion, sexual orientation, and familial status as potential traits that a student could be bullied over. House File 865 would change the definition of bullying to remove language that bullying is based on “any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of the student.”
Career education: House File 316 would require career planning curriculum be taught in fifth and sixth grades and expand criteria for career education in seventh and eighth grades, as well as have the Iowa Department of Education develop a list of industry recognized credentials, create a seal and provide it to schools to add onto student transcripts and other documents if they have earned a credential before graduating.
Cellphones in school: Gov. Kim Reynolds’ bill to set a statewide minimum policy banning the use of cellphones in K-12 school classrooms, House File 782, has gained approval in both chambers, but the Iowa House still must approve an amendment from the Senate before the measure can head to the governor’s desk. The Senate proposed changes requiring the Iowa Department of Education director to share a model policy on banning the use of personal electronic devices during instructional time by May 1, before districts’ deadline to adopt their own policy by July 1 ahead of the 2025-2026 school year. This version of the bill also removed an earlier requirement for students in grades 6 through 8 to take training on the “effects of social media.”
Charter school boards: House File 785 would change requirements for charter-school boards so that no more than one member can live outside of Iowa, and all members must be U.S. residents. The legislation made it through the second funnel after being passed by the Iowa Senate Education Committee April 3. 
Child abuse investigations: House File 389, passed by the Iowa House and attached to a companion Senate bill placed on unfinished business, would give the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services the authority to investigate alleged child abuse cases at schools and work with the state Board of Educational Examiners if these instances involve school employees.
Concussion diagnoses: House File 471 would expand the list of professionals who can direct a student to be removed from extracurricular activities based on them showing signs of brain damage or concussion to include those with a doctorate in psychology and specialized training in concussion management or neuropsychology. 
Dropout prevention funding: House File 579 would increase the limit modified supplemental amount ratio school districts can levy for dropout prevention programs to 5% if decided upon at an election, with the amount not allowed to increase more than .5% every fiscal year. 
Fetal development instruction: In February the Iowa Senate passed Senate File 175 in a 31-13 vote, a bill that would require fetal development videos and graphics depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization” to be shown in human growth and development and health classes for grades 1 through 12. The measure has been linked by opponents to the “Meet Baby Olivia” video produced by an anti-abortion organization, and said that the legislation could allow non-scientifically accurate information to be shown in public school courses. The Senate bill’s companion, House File 391, was moved to unfinished business for further consideration.
Grooming behavior: Senate File 273, passed by the Iowa Senate and surviving as “unfinished business” in the House, would require mandatory reporting of licensed school employees to the Board of Educational Examiners if they engage in “grooming behavior” toward students, defined as the process of “ building trust or emotional connections with a student with the intent to exploit such student.” 
Math, civics education: The House passed the governor’s proposal on math education in March. House File 784 would implement  early screening and targeted intervention strategies for students struggling with math in Iowa’s K-12 schools, with the state Department of Education providing schools and districts support with constructing personalized mathematics instruction plans. The companion to the bill, Senate File 450, includes a component requiring Iowa students pass the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ Naturalization Test with 60% or higher to graduating high school which is not present in the House legislation.
Schools and natural disasters: House File 315, passed unanimously by the Senate Education Committee, would allow school districts impacted by a natural disaster to have an additional year of budget adjustments. 
Nonpublic school athletics: House File 189, which the Senate Education Committee passed to the floor this week, would direct school districts to allow students living in the district but attending a nonpublic school to participate in athletics the district offers but the nonpublic school hasn’t for the past two years.
School chaplains: The Senate Education Committee approved House File 884, which allows public school districts, charter schools and innovation school zones to hire or allow religious chaplains to volunteer providing “services” for students. Democrats have criticized the measure as a breach of the separation of church and state.
School performance profiles: House file 393 would change how school performance grades for school districts are calculated by no longer requiring each time a student drops out of school after the first time be counted against the school. 
Tampons, pads in school bathrooms: House File 883 proposes providing free feminine hygiene products in women’s restrooms at Iowa schools for 6th through 12th grade students, with state funding available from the summer of 2025 through June 2028. The bill, referred to the House Appropriations Committee, is not subject to the funnel deadline.
Threat assessment teams: The Iowa Senate passed Senate File 583 unanimously in March, a bill that authorize K-12 school districts, private schools and charter schools to create threat assessment teams to coordinate resources and interventions for preventing school shootings. The teams would consist of school officials, law enforcement officers as well as mental health and social services workers, who would be allowed to share “reasonably necessary” information on students when a student exhibits behavior that could pose a safety risk to other students or school staff.
Year-round academic calendar: Passed unanimously by the Iowa Senate Education Committee at the end of March, House File 392 would allow school districts to apply to implement year-round school calendars for ninth through 12th grade. 
 Higher education

DEI in state entities: House File 856 would bar state entities, including community colleges, from spending private or public dollars on opening or maintaining diversity, equity and inclusion offices or officers. The Iowa Senate Education Committee approved an amendment to remove private universities from the legislation before passing the bill to the Senate floor April 3. 
Accreditation retaliation: House File 295 was one of several bills passed out of the Iowa Senate Education Committee just before the funnel deadline. It would bar national accrediting agencies from taking negative actions against state universities for complying with, or refusing to disobey, state law. If authorized by the attorney general, universities with cause would have the option to file a civil suit against the accreditor. 
College reporting requirements: Senate File 520 would change where community colleges report program-level data to from the state community colleges bureau to the Iowa Department of Education. The Iowa Department of Administrative Services and Department of Education must also develop an annual compensation schedule and set employee benefits for all employees of the Iowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired and Iowa School for the Deaf. It has been attached to House File 890 and placed on the calendar as unfinished business. 
General education requirements: House File 401 would, as amended by the Iowa House, establish general education requirements for Iowa’s public higher education system, codifying requirements to take courses in social studies, math and statistics, natural and social sciences, a world language, the humanities, Western heritage and American heritage. According to the bill, these classes cannot “distort significant historical events or include any curriculum or other material that teaches identity politics or is based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, or privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States of America or the state of Iowa.” It passed out of the Iowa Senate Education Committee on April 3.
National Guard financial aid: House Files 117 and 118, both passed out of the House and received approval from the Iowa Senate Education Committee, expand scholarship offerings for members of the Iowa National Guard and their families. HF 117 would establish a new scholarship program for National Guard members pursuing certifications rather than traditional degrees. HF 118 would change monetary limits on the existing National Guard Service Scholarship program to “the difference between the tuition rate at the institution attended by the national guard member less any financial aid the national guard member receives under certain specified federal programs,” according to the legislation. The bill removes language that bars recipients’ drill location, unit or placement in Army or Air National Guard from affecting their award amount. 
School of intellectual freedom: House File 437 and its companion, Senate File 127, have both been labeled as unfinished business. The House bill would have the University of Iowa establish a center for intellectual freedom, while the Senate version would direct the university to form a school instead. They would require the new center or school focus on “the historical ideas, traditions and texts that have shaped the American constitutional order and society,” according to bill language, and promote free speech, civil discourse, civic education and intellectual diversity.
Tuition freeze: House File 440 would, as amended by the Iowa House of Representatives, direct state universities to study the potential impacts of freezing tuition for students during their first year. Universities would also need to establish at least one three-year degree program and institute work plus programs, where students can work part time and have their tuition paid for by a qualified employer. It passed out of the Senate Education Committee on April 3. 
 Health care

Child care access: While the bills on Reynolds’ child care proposal, Senate File 445 and House File 623, were placed on the “unfinished business” calendar, Sinclair told reporters Thursday that amendments were expected on the measure before it would come to the Senate floor. The governor proposed shifting funding from existing Early Childhood Iowa (ECI) funding and federal Child Care and Development Fund Wrap Around Child Care funds to create three-year grants for full-day care for children, providing up to $100,000 annually for preschool providers and child care centers. The bill also would shift roughly $3.6 million in funding from the Shared Visions program for at-risk children from birth to age 5 to grants for at-risk 3- and 4-year-old children.
Health care training, access: The Iowa House passed Reynolds’ bill on health care, House File 972 in March. The bill directs Iowa HHS to draw down more than $150 million in federal funds to create 115 new medical residency slots at state teaching hospitals as part of an effort to address health care workforce shortages. The bill also seeks to increase rural health care access through efforts like increasing Medicaid rates for providers serving mothers and infants and establish a “hub-and-spoke” funding model for rural health care systems based off the Centers of Excellence Program.
HPV vaccine for minors: Senate File 304 and House File 384, placed on unfinished business, are a proposal to remove an exemption currently in Iowa law that allows minors to get vaccinations related to the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases or infections – primarily, the  human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The bill would require minors have parental consent to receive these vaccines, in line with current requirements for most other vaccinations.
Medicaid work requirements: Senate File 615, legislation setting work requirements for Iowa’s expanded Medicaid program, has passed through both chambers, but has not yet made it to the governor’s desk. The bill would require people receiving health coverage through the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, or IHAWP, work least 80 hours each month to retain eligibility. The requirement would apply to people between the ages of 19 to 64, with some exceptions, including people with a serious illness or injury and those with children under age 6.
Medical conscience: House File 571, passed by the Iowa House, would allow health care professionals, institutions and payors to not perform or pay for a health care service that goes against their conscience. While there are exemptions for emergency medical services, the bill states these entities cannot be held civilly, criminally or administratively liable if they say in “good faith” that they not to provide a service due to their beliefs.
Pharmacy benefit managers: Senate File 383 and House File 852, placed under “unfinished business,” would set new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the businesses that negotiate prescription drug costs between drug manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies. The bills would require PBMs reimburse pharmacies for drug costs at the national or Iowa average acquisition cost and limit certain PBM practices like limiting the ability for these entities to restrict which pharmacies or pharmacists fill a person’s prescription based on certain criteria.
 Nutrition

Double Up Food Bucks: Senate File 232 was assigned to an appropriations subcommittee in February to appropriate $1 million to the Double Up Food Bucks program which allows recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to double their spending on produce. A House version of the bill, which would have created new rules for SNAP eligible foods, did not advance ahead of the funnel.  
House File 796 advanced from the House Floor as House File 970 and would appropriate $1 million to the Double Up Food Bucks program, but only if a waiver is granted to limit SNAP eligible foods. 
Rural grocery initiative: House File 550, would allocate $2 million to establish a grocer reinvestment program and a local produce processing grant program. The bill is in a House Appropriations Committee. 
School nutrition: Senate File 525 and House File 851, which advanced from the House, were attached and placed on unfinished business. The bill would seek a waiver from federal nutrition guidelines to create Iowa-specific guidelines that would focus school meals and nutrition education on the food sources of Iowa, like corn, pork and dairy. 
 State government

Citizenship verification for voting: House File 954, passed by the House and approved by the Senate State Government committee, is legislation brought forward by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate following controversial guidance ahead of the 2024 election challenging the ballots of  2,176 registered voters as “potential noncitizens” based on state information. In March, Pate’s office said 277 of these individuals were confirmed to not hold U.S. citizenship.
The bill would allow the Secretary of State’s office to contract with state and federal agencies to verify the citizenship status of registered voters, a measure Pate said would help prevent situations like in 2024, when his office was unable to confirm these individuals’ citizenship status because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would not share access to citizenship information. The bill also would ban ranked choice voting and increase the eligibility requirements for gaining “political party” status on Iowa ballots.
County funding: House Study Bill 310 proposes a three-year moratorium on all programs and related funding from the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the four Iowa counties with the highest population – currently, Polk, Linn, Scott and Johnson counties. The bill, a Ways and Means proposal, is not subject to the funnel deadline
Election recounts: House File 928 would make multiple changes to Iowa’s election recount system. Candidates would need a threshold of a 1% difference in votes — or 50 votes, whichever is less — in order to request a recount, and the state would only cover costs if the margin of initial results were within 0.1%. The bill, placed on “unfinished business” in the Senate, also would change the composition of election recount boards and set an earlier deadline for requesting recounts.
Property taxes: House Study Bill 313 and Senate Study Bill 1208 are companion bills on the proposal from Ways and Means Committee chairs Rep. Bobby Kauffman and Sen. Dan Dawson to address rising property taxes in the state. While there are many components to the bill, one of the top changes included is a move from the state’s “rollback” to a “revenue-restricted” system for calculating local property tax costs, capping the increase of most property tax levy rates to 2% each year. The measure would also shift $426 million funding for K-12 schools from local property taxes to the state.
While Republican legislative leaders said they aimed to move on property taxes this session, they said that the legislation was being reviewed to ensure that the measure will have its intended impact of lowering property tax costs for Iowans. Sinclair said, she would “like to see it get done this year, but we want it done right, rather than fast.”
Religious beliefs of adoptive, foster parents: Senate File 473 would prohibit Iowa HHS from requiring a prospective foster or adoptive parent to accept policies that conflict with their moral or religious beliefs on gender identity and sexual orientation when determining eligibility for becoming a child’s caretaker. Opponents to the bill said the measure could subject children in these circumstances to practices like conversion therapy, though supporters said language stating the department is allowed to consider the child and family of origin’s beliefs related to gender and sexuality when determining placement addresses these concerns.
 Labor and the workforce

Public sector union lists: Senate File 472 would allow Iowans to seek court action compelling government employers to provide a list of employees within a bargaining unit to the Employment Appeal Board (EAB), a step needed before union recertification votes. Some Republicans said the bill was needed because some employers have intentionally not submitted lists to preserve union representation in contract negotiations. The legislation was approved by the Senate in March and by the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday.
 Justice and public safety

Age verification for obscene materials: House File 864, passed by the House and placed on “unfinished business” in the Senate, would require pornography websites and other obscene-material distributors to implement “reasonable” age verification methods to ensure minors cannot access materials on their platforms.
Anti-SLAPP lawsuits: The House approved House File 472 in March, a bill providing protections against “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits by allowing for expedited relief in court for actions related to First Amendment rights, like the freedom of speech and press. These lawsuits, typically filed against entities such as newspapers and activists, attempt to stop individuals and organizations from speaking publicly about certain issues by engaging them in expensive litigation.
Exposing minors to obscene materials: House File 306 would raise penalties for knowingly disseminating or exhibiting obscene materials to a minor. The first offense of the crime would be charged as a serious misdemeanor, raised to an aggravated misdemeanor for the second offense, and raised to a Class D felony for a third or subsequent offense with additional mandatory minimum confinement sentences. Minors charged for exhibiting or sharing obscene materials to another minor would face a serious misdemeanor charge but would not face the heightened charges for additional offenses.
Firearm age limits: House File 924, passed by the House and approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would lower the age limit for carrying a firearm from 21 to 18. The bill was amended to remove the ability for people between ages 18 to 21 to obtain a concealed carry permit.
Human smuggling: House File 572 would establish human smuggling as a criminal offense, defined as acts including transporting an undocumented person with the intent to conceal them from law enforcement, encouraging or coercing them to stay in the U.S. against the law by concealing or harboring them, and directing multiple individuals to be on agricultural lands without the landowner’s consent. The crime would be charged as a Class C felony with heightened penalties for cases involving monetary gain and the risk or cause of serious bodily injury or death. Some immigrant rights and religious advocates expressed concerns that the bill could lead to people providing aid to undocumented immigrants facing criminal charges.
Minors testifying in court: House Joint Resolution 9 and Senate Joint Resolution 9, placed under “unfinished business,” are Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird’s proposed constitutional amendment to allow minors and adults with certain disabilities to testify remotely against their alleged abusers using a closed-circuit television system. Bird said the measure, the first step in the process of amending the state constitution, was necessary to address an Iowa Supreme Court ruling that ruled children could not provide remote testimony in these circumstances because it violated the defendant’s constitutional right to confront their accuser.
Open records, meetings: House File 706 would raise penalties for violations of Iowa’s open meetings laws and require newly elected and appointed public officials to complete training on the state’s open meetings and records laws.
Police review boards: Senate File 311 would ban cities that have a civil service commission from adopting or establishing citizens’ boards that review the conduct of law enforcement officers. The measure, passed by the Senate and placed on “unfinished business” in the House, also makes changes to city civil service commissions and some processes for the legal processes surrounding disputes with a commission’s decisions or actions.
Service animals: House File 615 would make it easier for law enforcement to charge individuals for misrepresenting an animal as a service animal. The bill, passed by the House, would remove current requirements in state law that a person must first be given a warning that misrepresenting an animal as a service animal is illegal, and that the person being charged must know the animal is not actually a service animal or service animal in training.
 Natural resources

Governor’s energy bill: House File 834 and Senate File 585, known as the governor’s energy bill, would grant existing utility companies the right of first refusal to new transmission projects, create requirements for advanced ratemaking, and task DNR with regulating anaerobic digesters. The bills are in a House Ways and Means subcommittee and the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
 Pipelines

Eminent domain: House File 639 combined a number of pipeline-related bills, including House File 939 which would have adjusted the definition of a common carrier, House File 944 which broadened who could intervene in Iowa Utilities Commission proceedings, House File 923 which restricted the IUC from imposing sanctions on intervenors, House File 780 which limited hazardous liquid pipelines to one 25-year term, House File 240 which expanded insurance requirements for a pipeline and House File 790 which required IUC presence at all meetings and hearings.
The bill was significantly amended by a Senate panel to strike the common carrier definition, permit limits, and intervenor requirements. It also adjusted the insurance requirements, added a clause to allow operators to seek voluntary easements outside of the project corridor and would apply to all projects seeking eminent domain.
The bill is eligible for floor debate in the Senate.
Review of eminent domain: House File 763, would allow Iowa landowners to seek a legally binding explanation of their rights from a district court in the event of an eminent domain claim. The bill is in the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 
 Bills that died

 
 Education

Academic reviews: House File 420 would have required that state universities conduct reviews of all undergraduate and graduate academic programs, determine if and how they align with state workforce needs and submit a report to the General Assembly with recommendations for whether programs should be changed, eliminated or kept the same. The bill was never brought up on the House floor after being passed out of the House Higher Education Committee.
DEI courses in public universities: House File 269, formerly House Study Bill 53, would have barred state universities from requiring students to take a course related to diversity, equity and inclusion or critical race theory to satisfy general education requirements or earn any level of certification or degree, with certain exceptions. Employees of the institutions are also prohibited from requiring or incentivizing faculty to participate in DEI or critical race theory-related practices or include those topics in content. The bill died after Senate subcommittee passage. 
DEI in community colleges: House File 855 would have added community colleges to legislation passed last year barring state universities from funding or maintaining DEI offices. While this legislation did not make it through the second funnel, community colleges are included in other legislation that would prohibit state entities from using money to start or keep DEI offices and officers. 
DEI in private universities: House File 854 would have prohibited private universities from opening, funding or otherwise maintaining offices of diversity, equity and inclusion as a prerequisite for participation in the Iowa Tuition Grant program. It failed to make it through the second funnel. 
Financial information: House File 296 would have required universities to report and post online budgets lines, expenditures and goods and services totaling $50,000, as well as written contracts, salary reports and any expenditures made related to diversity, equity and inclusion. It has been referred back to the Iowa House Higher Education Committee alongside several other bills after failing to make it through the second funnel. 
Foreign funding: House File 575, which would have required state universities to put together an annual report on foreign funding sources, amounts and how funds were used, did not make it through the second funnel deadline. 
Iowa Tuition Grant changes: House File 867 would have required Iowa College Aid to allocate half of Iowa Tuition Grant dollars to students enrolled in degree programs connected to high-wage, high-demand job fields. Passed by the Iowa House Higher Education Committee in early March, the bill died in the second funnel before House debate took place.  
Loan programs: House File 703 would have required the Iowa student loan liquidity corporation, or ISL Education Lending, to report certain loan data to Iowa College Aid relating to the annual percentage rate of the Federal Direct PLUS loan compared to college family loans and partnership loans. If the loans had a lower APR than the federal loan program, Iowa College Aid would have needed to post the information online and share it with universities, which would add it to financial aid offers. The bill did not survive the second funnel after being passed by a Senate subcommittee.
Civil government course: House File 402, which failed to make it through the second funnel, would have required college students to take a course on American history and civil government in order to earn their baccalaureate degree. 
Penalties for pro-terrorism language on campus: House File 576 would have enabled public and private colleges to penalize certain nonimmigrant visa-holders for voicing support for, or encouraging others to support, terrorist organizations or actions. Penalties included suspension, expulsion and job termination. 
Tuition waivers: House File 577 would have resulted in state universities waiving tuition and fees and providing a $5,000-a-semester stipend for undergraduate students who earn the highest-possible scores on the ACT or SAT. It failed to pass through the second funnel. 
Syllabus reports: House File 270 would have directed state university instructors to post syllabi information online in a way the public can access, including the instructor’s name, planned lessons, course requirements and materials that will be used in class. The legislation stalled after being passed through the Iowa House Higher Education Committee and did not make it through the second funnel. 
Baseball: House File 153 would have directed Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa to reinstate men’s baseball teams. The bill did not survive the first funnel.
Bible studies in public schools: Legislation that directs the Iowa Board of Education to establish course standards for elective social studies classes on “Hebrew Scriptures or the Old or New Testament of the Bible” for students in grades 9 through 12 made it was approved by education committees in both chambers, but did not advance further in either chamber. House File 845 and Senate File 510 would have required the state board and school districts that chose to host classes on the Bible to remain in compliance with state and federal religious neutrality requirements.
Gulf of America: House lawmakers had considered House Study Bill 97, a proposal to require Iowa schools to replace references to the Gulf of Mexico with “Gulf of America” and “Denali” with “Mount McKinley” in classroom instruction and handouts in line with President Donald Trump’s order earlier in 2025.
Home schooling: Legislation that would have made changes to Iowa’s regulations on homeschooling that included allowing more than four unrelated children to receive private instruction from one person and requiring homeschooled students have proof of immunization and blood lead tests submitted by their parents did not advance past the committee level. House File 888 also proposed prohibiting Iowa world language classes from using gender-neutral language for languages that have a grammatical gender system, like Spanish.
Library associations: House File 880 would have changed library eligibility for Enrich Iowa funds provided through the State Library of Iowa to exclude members of a nonprofit organization – such as the Iowa Library Association or American Library Association — that “promotes federal and state legislation related to libraries and engages in advocacy efforts at the federal, state or local level.”
Sexual abuse education: Senate File 172, also called “Erin’s Law,” proposed directing the Department of Education to make guidelines for schools to use for teaching K-6 students about child sexual abuse. 
School technology: Senate File 516 proposed directing the Iowa Department of Education, alongside Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, to create a working group focused on school technology and its impacts on students’ “social and behavioral development, attention span, mental concentration and learning ability.”
Use of names, pronouns: Senate File 8 would have prohibited discipline for a teacher or another student who does not use a transgender student’s preferred name or pronouns if it differs from their legal name or pronouns corresponding with their legally assigned sex. Parents of transgender children said the measure conflicted with legislation passed in previous sessions that allowed families to direct schools to use a name different from their legal name.
Food dyes and margarine: House File 212 would have banned synthetic food dyes, margarine and other artificial additives from school meals, snacks and beverages. The bill was modeled after a similar law in California. 
 Health care

Child care workers: House File 382 proposed expanding Iowa’s laws limiting the use of minors in child care. In Iowa, minors as young as age 16 can work in child care centers without adult supervision. The bill proposed allowing minor workers to provide “flex care” for children from infancy to age 2 without direct supervision.
Abortion protection: A proposed constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, dealing with the right to reproductive care, died during the first funnel deadline. 
mRNA vaccines: A proposed ban on gene-based vaccines, like the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, died during the first funnel deadline. Senate File 360 would have set penalties for healthcare providers that administer vaccines that use nucleic acids like messenger RNA (mRNA), with fines of $500 for each violation.
Medication abortion restrictions: House File 775 proposed restrictions on abortion medication by mail. The legislation would have required abortion medications be distributed in-person exclusively, and would have required patients give written consent for the medication acknowledging they understand the risks and potential to reverse an abortion through medication.
Nursing homes inspectors: Senate File 532 proposed several nursing home care changes, including a $600,000 increase in state funding for 30 additional care-facility inspectors and an increase in penalties for violations of certain regulations by health care facilities. The bill also proposed banning Medicaid-certified nursing homes in Iowa from requiring that residents or families agree to arbitration instead of seeking legal action over negligent care claims.
Personal needs allowance: Senate File 476 proposed raising the monthly personal needs allowance for Medicaid beneficiaries in nursing homes from $50 to $65 per month. The allowances are used by residents at care facilities to pay for items such as cellphone service, hairdressing, clothing, cable TV and snacks.
Vaccine manufacturer immunity: House File 712 was a proposal requiring vaccine manufacturers waive their immunity from lawsuits over certain vaccine injuries that are currently covered through a federal, no-fault compensation program under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.
 State government

Annexing southern Minnesota: Senate File 354, introduced by Sen. Mike Bousselot, would have directed the state to begin negotiations with Minnesota for the purchase of nine southern Minnesota counties. The bill did not receive a subcommittee hearing.
Artificial intelligence: House Study Bill 294, which representatives noted was a “work in progress” would have created protections from election materials produced with artificial intelligence, or “algorithmic discrimination” caused by AI. The bill advanced from the House Economic Growth and Technology Committee before the first funnel, but chairman Rep. Ray Sorenson told committee members Monday he expects to continue working on the bill next year. 
Citizenship on IDs: House File 439  would have required that driver’s licenses and non-operator identification cards list a person’s citizenship status. While critics said the measure could lead to discrimination, some poll workers told lawmakers the inclusion of citizenship status on IDs could help them confirm a person’s eligibility to vote.
Homelessness: A proposal discussed in early March that would criminalize sleeping and camping on public property did not advance. House Study Bill 286 and Senate Study Bill 1195, supported by the Austin, Texas-based Cicero Institute, would have allowed cities and counties to create designated spaces for homeless encampments and create “drug-free homeless service zones.” The legislation also would have allowed for criminal charges against facility operators providing shelter and services to individuals experiencing homelessness that also allow people to possess or use a controlled substance in their facility.
 Justice and public safety

Age verification for social media: House File 798 proposed requiring social media companies to obtain parental permission before a minor was allowed to create an account on their platform. Parents and guardians would also have been  required to have access to a minor’s posts and messages on the platform, with the ability to revoke access at any time to the account.
Booking photos: House File 47 would have limited the public release of police mugshots until after the person arrested was convicted of the crime for which they were arrested, with exceptions in cases where a person was a fugitive or when the photo’s release would help law enforcement apprehend the individual.
Death penalty: Iowa lawmakers did not advance Senate File 320, a bill to reestablish the death penalty in Iowa in cases where a person was convicted of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer.
ICE agreements: House Study Bill 187 proposed requiring all Iowa law enforcement agencies to enter into agreements with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to participate in immigration law enforcement efforts. The bill did not advance past the first funnel following concerns expressed by Latino and immigrant rights advocates as well as law enforcement officers.
Immigration law enforcement: House File 946, which passed the House, would have stated that law enforcement officers who “knowingly and intentionally” fail to comply with the state laws on federal immigration enforcement would be subject to investigation by the attorney general. The measure was significantly amended from its initial language, which would have stated law enforcement in violation of the state law could face a Class D felony charge. The bill was not taken up by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Obscene performances: House File 891 would have created a new criminal charge for knowingly exposing a minor to an obscene performance or admitting a minor to premises with obscene performances, following obscenity definitions under existing Iowa code. The bill was amended heavily from an earlier version that focused on penalties related to minors attending drag shows, which were defined as “performances where “the main aspect of the performance is a performer who exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth through the use of clothing, makeup, accessories, or other gender signifiers.”
Obscenity laws in libraries: House File 521 would have repealed current obscenity law exemptions for educational institutions and libraries. Opponents said the measure could have subject public libraries to costly litigation over material that is not “obscene” under Iowa law, but that members of the community did not want to be available through public libraries.
Pesticide lawsuits: Grassley told reporters Thursday that legislation providing legal protections for pesticide manufacturers from certain lawsuits, including claims that pesticide products gave individuals cancer, did not have the support needed to pass in the Iowa House. Senate File 394 was passed by the Senate in late March.
Traffic cameras: House File 764 proposed banning local governments from contracting with third-party vendors to collect traffic camera fines.
 Natural resources

Chemtrails: House File 927 proposed a prohibition on the intentional emission of air contaminants that intentionally impact “temperature, weather, or the intensity of sunlight,” legislation that some critics said was tied to the chemtrails conspiracy theory. One of the suggested amendments to the bill, introduced by Rep. Adam Zabner, would have directed the Iowa Department of Natural resources to conduct a study to “research the existence of Bigfoot in the state.”
Beneficial use water permits: House File 861, formerly House File 480, would have required the Iowa Department of Natural Resources to evaluate the “beneficial use” of a water use permit application on a case-by-case basis, rather than a categorical determination. The bill was sent back to the House Natural Resources Committee. 
Community solar: House File 404, would have connected small solar fields, built in brownfield sites, on top of commercial warehouses or in underutilized farmland, into the electric power grid. Community members could purchase shares of the solar project and then receive waivers on their electric bills from the operating utility company. The bill did not see floor debate despite being eligible since early February. Existing utility companies were opposed to the bill and said non-affected ratepayers would have to shoulder some of the maintenance costs.  
Land acquisition: Senate File 553 and House File 714, which would have blocked the DNR from purchasing land at auction, or acquiring land from anyone other than a willing donor or seller, did not advance to the floor of either chamber.
PFAS: House File 723, which would have required water treatment plants to test sewage sludge for PRFAS, or perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl, and notify landowners if the sludge, destined for land application, contained PFAS. The bill gained a subcommittee meeting after the first funnel, but was not heard by the House Environmental Protection Committee. 
Gardening: Senate File 494 would have prohibited state and local governments from enacting rules or ordinances that prohibit Iowans from establishing or maintaining a residential garden. The bill advanced from the Senate floor and from a House subcommittee, but was not heard in the House Local Government Committee. 
 Pipelines

Climate change language: House File 302, would have precluded the Iowa Utilities Commission from considering climate change when issuing a permit for a hazardous liquid pipeline. 
Eminent domain for CO2 pipelines: House File 943 was one of two pipeline-related bills to advance from the House. This bill would have blocked pipelines carrying liquified carbon dioxide from receiving eminent domain rights in the state. 
Office of the Consumer Advocate: House File 578, which would have restored the Office of the Consumer Advocate as an independent office, advanced from the House, and was assigned to a subcommittee which did not schedule a hearing.
 
 Sent to the governor

 
Gender identity protections: The first bill the governor signed this session was Senate File 418, removing gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act. Previously under the state civil rights code, transgender people and others were given protections against discrimination on the basis of their gender identity in areas such as employment, housing, public accommodations and education. The law also removes transgender Iowans’ ability to change their designated sex on their birth certificate after receiving gender-affirming medical treatment, and changes definitions in Iowa law for “sex” and “gender.”
Hands-free cellphones:  Reynolds signed into law Senate File 22, a ban on the handheld use of cellphones and other electronic devices while driving outside of voice-activated or handsfree modes. The distracted driving bill was approved by the Iowa House in March after several years where the bill failed to advance through the chamber. 
Open beverage containers: In March, Reynolds also signed into law House File 181, a measure expanding Iowa’s ban on open containers of alcoholic drinks in vehicles’ passenger compartments. The law now includes beverages containing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. 
Workforce training contract requirements: The governor signed Senate File 603, a bill that prohibits state agencies and local governments from mandating requirements related to  apprenticeship training for contractors outside of legal obligations. Other “restrictions, qualifications, or requirements” imposed by local entities on contractors, subcontractors, developers and apprentices would also be barred.

Chuck Grassley introduced legislation this week requiring more congressional oversight of such decisions.

The &#8220;Liberation [&#8230;]","Sen. Chuck Grassley appeared on ""Iowa Press"" on Sept. 15, 2023. (Screenshot via Iowa PBS)In light of Wednesday’s tariff announcement by President Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley introduced legislation this week requiring more congressional oversight of such decisions.
The president announced he was setting a baseline 10% levy on all international imports Wednesday, effective April 5, with higher tariffs on some countries taking effect April 9.
The “Liberation Day” announcement triggered the largest one-day drop in the U.S. stock market since June 2020 and has been met with heavy criticism from American businesses. As part of the response Thursday, Grassley introduced the “American Trade Review Act of 2025” alongside Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington.
The legislation seeks to restore some Congressional authority over tariffs, including requirements that Congress must pass a joint resolution approving a new tariff within 60 days. The legislation would also allow Congress to vote to end tariffs at any time through a resolution of disapproval. The bill would require that within 48 hours of taking action on tariffs, the president must give Congress an explanation of the reason for implementing or raising a tariff along with an analysis of the potential impact on American businesses and consumers.
Grassley said the measure would shift important powers over foreign economic policy from the president to Congress.
“For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,” Grassley said in a statement. “Building on my previous efforts as Finance Committee chairman, I’m joining Sen. Cantwell to introduce the bipartisan Trade Review Act of 2025 to reassert Congress’ constitutional role and ensure Congress has a voice in trade policy.”
U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa also weighed in on the tariffs Thursday, telling reporters she believes tariffs are needed to ensure fairer negotiations between the U.S. and other countries moving forward.
“The president’s goal here is to not only get other countries to the negotiating table, but really focused on helping to create more opportunity,” Hinson said, according to the Des Moines Register. “… After four years of high inflation — and really no new trade opportunities, no new manufacturing opportunities — that’s what they’re going to see.”
Iowa Democrats have criticized Iowa’s U.S. House delegation — all Republicans — for not pushing back against Trump’s tariff policies, which Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said will hurt Iowa’s economy.
“It’s clear that Iowa’s representatives in Washington are either inept or too afraid to fight back — even when our economy is struggling,” Hart said in a statement. “I’m sure we’ll hear expressions of ‘concern,’ but actions speak louder than words and they voted to give away the farm to a president more focused on tariffs than lower prices. Iowans need independent voices that will do what’s best for Iowa and take us in a more sensible direction.”
Hinson bill would codify Trump order on Treasury Department anti-fraud, waste practices
Hinson introduced legislation Thursday to codify an executive order made by Trump in March titled “Protecting America’s Bank Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.” The bill directs the U.S. Treasury Department to work with the Office of Management and Budget to establish recertification and pre-award verification procedures that agencies must use before payments are disbursed, and to “minimize administrative barriers to accessing and using data to prevent fraud and improper payments.”
Agencies are also directed to consolidate financial systems under the order and submit compliance plans to the Treasury Department detailing their efforts to update systems. The bill would also require agencies to share payment information verification and other relevant data for the purpose of identifying fraud or improper payments.
Hinson said in a news release the Government Accountability Office’s estimates the federal government loses between $233 billion and $521 billion each year due to fraud and said that was her motivation to introduce the bill.
“That’s hundreds of billions of your tax dollars flushed down the drain without swamp bureaucrats blinking an eye,” Hinson said in statement. “President Trump’s executive order to prevent improper payments is a great step to end this abuse, and my bill will make this effort permanent to ensure your hard-earned tax dollars are not wasted.”
Nunn backs bill allowing SNAP purchases of hot, ready meals
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn was a part of the bipartisan group introducing the “Hot Foods Act” this week, a bill permitting the purchase of hot, prepared foods through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
SNAP, the food benefits program for low-income families, seniors and people with disabilities, currently has restrictions in place that stops recipients from purchasing hot or prepared meals, while allowing benefits to be spent on cold or frozen versions of the same food.
The legislation, led by U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, a New York Democrat, would remove limits on hot and ready-to-eat meals, which she said would provide families on SNAP the ability to buy food that suits their needs.
“The Hot Foods Act removes this dated rule preventing people from purchasing hot foods with SNAP, giving flexibility to working parents, people with disabilities, and the many hard-working Americans who need to put food on the table every day,” Meng said. “I am proud to work across the aisle to make this commonsense change.”
In a news release Thursday, Nunn called the bill a “commonsense fix” that will help Iowans on SNAP access convenient, nutritious meals.
“No family should have to choose between hunger and dignity,” said Rep. Nunn. ”Iowans deserve the flexibility to use their nutrition benefits on warm, ready-to-eat meals that make life a little easier — especially for working parents.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-6.24.37-PM-1024x615.png,,,2025-04-04 16:05:44.287538

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The Trump administration’s move to gut a library-supporting federal agency could make a victory for backers of the South Dakota State Library short-lived.
Last year, State Library advocates were aghast at a budget plan from then-Gov. Kristi Noem that would’ve hollowed out the Pierre-based organization, which operates under the umbrella of the state Department of Education.
The Legislature softened the cuts during its annual lawmaking session that ended earlier this month, keeping the State Library alive and eligible for a federal grant that funds much of the organization’s budget. 
Then, the day after lawmakers went home in mid-March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the head of the Institute for Museum and Library Services, or IMLS — which provides the grant — to cut its operations to the “maximum extent allowable by law.” 
That has State Library advocates worried about its future again.
Legislative committee softens budget blow to SD State Library, but concerns remain

Among other duties, the State Library handles interlibrary loans, pays for databases that are accessible at no cost through any public library in the state, provides support for summer reading programs and organizes professional development workshops. It also offers Braille and talking book services for readers with disabilities.
Noem’s budget plan, unveiled in December, would have pared down every piece of the State Library’s operations except those last two items. The proposed cuts were deep enough to dash about $1.3 million in federal matching dollars from the IMLS. That money, on top of the state’s $1 million contribution, was enough to fund the State Library’s border-to-border operations and pay its 21 employees.
Noem wasn’t around to fight for her proposal, however. She left the state to take a job as head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security before state lawmakers dug into the details of her budget.
The Legislature ultimately worked with the administration of her successor, Gov. Larry Rhoden, to fashion a compromise that spared the jobs of all but 3.5 State Library employees. 
The $850,000 in state funding approved in the deal with the state Education Department was enough to preserve IMLS grant funding, even as the Legislature dissolved the citizen board that oversees the State Library. Summer reading program support, training for librarians and most of the databases were saved in the deal.
Nancy Van Der Weide, the Education Department’s spokeswoman, said databases from EBSCO, World Book, BookFlix, Peterson’s Test Prep, SIRS Issues Research, Discoverer, Research Library, U.S. Newsstream, and CultureGrams will remain available to South Dakota citizens through the State Library. 
State unsure about impact of Trump action
The IMLS dollars that buoy South Dakota’s State Library serve similar purposes in every state. Grants from the organization also support curation and collection management activities at museums and local libraries.
Congress last authorized IMLS grant funding in 2018, during President Donald Trump’s first term in office. There’s money available through the 2025 federal fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
Trump’s order gave the agency a week to craft a plan to comply with the edict. IMLS Acting Director Keith E. Sonderling has already placed all employees of IMLS on administrative leave.
South Dakota’s State Library has its funding in hand from federal fiscal year 2024, according to Van Der Weide. The department “is waiting on a grant award for FY 2025,” she wrote, referring to the current round of funding.
Congress authorized grant funding through FY 2025, she said. But as a department, Van Der Weide said, “we do not have a clear indication” as to the impact of the Trump executive order.
Library group reaction, union concerns
The congressional authorization is some comfort to Elizabeth Fox, head of the South Dakota Library Association. That group’s membership rallied opposition to Noem’s proposed cuts, both before and during the legislative session. 
The words “allowable by law” in the Trump order and the knowledge that another year of federal grant money is written into the law helped calm — for her, at least — some of the “more extreme” reactions that followed news of the IMLS targeting.
Trump order would gut agency that gives library grants to SD

Fox was thinking about the next round of IMLS funding long before Noem’s December budget address. Every five-year funding cycle for the federal agency represents a moment of action for library advocates around the nation, Fox said.
“We have known for a year now that we were looking at getting that renewed,” Fox said. “We knew we were going to be having this discussion.”
Others remain concerned, especially after the news on administrative leave for IMLS staff. That move is likely to complicate the agency’s performance of its statutory obligations, according to a federal employees union called the American Federation of Government Employees. 
“In the absence of staff, all work processing 2025 applications has ended,” the group’s local chapter wrote in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. “The status of previously awarded grants is unclear. Without staff to administer the programs, it is likely that most grants will be terminated.”
Museum director: IMLS director statement ‘terrifying’
Conor McMahon heads the Journey Museum in Rapid City. His organization got $50,000 from IMLS a few years ago to help fund an exhibit on the historic, deadly Rapid City floods of 1972.
The federal agency also serves as a funding source for unglamorous museum necessities like new shelving, McMahon said. That’s a topic the Journey director expects to broach with the Rapid City Council in the coming months to deal with a dearth of space in the organization’s building. 
Trump’s firings reach into a Rapid City museum and derail an expert’s career

“If the city doesn’t fund this, IMLS would have been our second source,” McMahon said.
The Trump administration’s administrative leave order for IMLS employees was set for 90 days. Even if those employees return to work at the end of 90 days, or at the order of a federal judge, McMahon is not encouraged by a statement from Sonderling, the IMLS acting director. Sonderling is also the deputy secretary for the Department of Labor. Sonderling said he’s committed to “revitalize IMLS and restore focus on patriotism, ensuring we preserve our country’s core values, promote American exceptionalism and cultivate love of country in future generations.”
To McMahon and other museum and library advocates around the country, that sounds like a pledge to politicize the work of preserving and maintaining the nation’s history and culture.
For museum curators and library professionals who aim to offer an honest, unvarnished and nuanced perspective to the public, McMahon said, “I don’t think you could find a more terrifying statement than that.”

Free.,Judge orders return of Maryland father deported by mistake to El Salvador prison,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-orders-return-maryland-father-deported-mistake-el-salvador-prison,,"GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A federal judge in Maryland Friday ordered the Trump administration to return a national from El Salvador by April 7 who was erroneously deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite an order blocking such removal.The ruling from U.S. District Court of Maryland Judge Paula Xinis sets up a fight with the Trump administration. Officials have admitted the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia of Beltsville, Maryland, was a mistake, but have stood by their actions.The case could also mean that the more than 250 Venezuelan men in a separate case who were removed under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 without due process can be returned to the U.S. Cheers could be heard outside the courthouse after the order, as dozens of protestors waited for the decision.‘It was unconstitutional’Xinis, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, said “there is no evidence to hold” Abrego Garcia at the notorious prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, known as CECOT, and even noted his March 12 arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had no basis for removal.“That means from the moment he was seized, it was unconstitutional,” Xinis said.The attorney representing the Department of Justice, Erez Reuveni, said the Trump administration is not challenging the merits of the case and the only argument it has is that the Maryland court lacks jurisdiction because Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador.Xinis pressed on what grounds Abrego Garcia was removed to the prison.Reuveni said he has no idea and was not given any information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.She asked why Abrego Garcia could not be returned to the United States, which is what his family was seeking in Friday’s preliminary injunction hearing.Reuveni said that he has asked officials that same question, and has not received an answer that is ""satisfactory.""Reuveni made one request to the court, that Xinis give the administration of President Donald Trump 24 hours to try to rectify the situation.U.S. paying $6 millionAttorneys for Abrego Garcia are not only asking for him to be returned, but for the Trump administration to cease payments to the mega-prison for his detainment. The White House has stated it’s paying the government of El Salvador $6 million to detain nearly 300 men.Reuveni said because Abrego Garcia is in custody in El Salvador, he is no longer in U.S. custody and therefore cannot be retrieved.Xinis pushed back on that argument, noting that the U.S. and El Salvador have a contract to detain the men at the prison.Reuveni said that it’s not a contract the U.S. and El Salvador have.Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, the attorney for Abrego Garcia, contended that “there is significant coordination between the two governments.”He noted that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has filmed herself while visiting CECOT and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has a close relationship with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.Xinis said to Reuveni that because the U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to detain the men, “I can draw the logical argument that the U.S. is the payer.”She asked Reuveni if he has any evidence to show her that contradicts that knowledge.“The government made a choice here to produce no evidence,” Reuveni said.Wartime law invokedOn March 15, three deportation flights left for El Salvador with two planes carrying Venezuelans removed under the wartime law and a third plane that carried nationals from El Salvador, including Abrego Garcia.A 2019 order from an immigration judge deemed that Abrego Garcia should be removed from the U.S. However, he was granted protection because it was more ""likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador"" if he were returned, according to court documents.Attorneys for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could have challenged that decision, but did not. Instead, Abrego Garcia was required to check in with ICE every year, including earlier this year.When Abrego Garcia was driving his 5-year-old son home on March 12, he was pulled over by ICE and informed that his “status had changed,” and was quickly transferred to a detention center in Texas. Within three days he was on a plane to CECOT, despite the order barring his removal to El Salvador.Xinis asked Reuveni under what authority Abrego Garcia was removed and he said he didn’t know. All he was given was a declaration by ICE Acting Field Office Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Robert L. Cerna, he said.“This was an oversight, and the removal was carried out in good faith based on the existence of a final order of removal and Abrego-Garcia’s purported membership in MS-13,” Cerna wrote in a Monday court filing.Xinis said if the government could not cite what legal authority he was being removed under, “then there is no basis to have seized him in the first place. That’ how I'm looking at it.”ICE and the Department of Justice have admitted the removal was an ""administrative error,” but the Trump administration has stood by its decision.White House gets involvedVice President J.D. Vance wrote on social media, without evidence, that Abrego Garcia was a convicted member of the MS-13 gang and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt this week echoed Vance.""The administration maintains the position that this individual who was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang,"" Leavitt said.Because of those comments by Leavitt, Sandoval-Moshenberg asked the judge to “keep the government on a tight leash.”Abrego Garcia does not have a criminal record in the U.S., El Salvador or anywhere else, Sandoval-Moshenberg has stated.Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. without legal authorization in 2011, fleeing violence in his home country of El Salvador, according to court records. Six years later while he was looking for work at a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, he was taken into custody by Prince George’s County Police Department.While there, he was questioned about gang affiliation and law enforcement did not believe he was not a member of the MS-13 gang, according to court records.The evidence officers submitted included Abrego Garcia wearing a Chicago Bulls hat, a hoodie and a statement from a confidential informant that stated he was a member of MS-13, according to court documents.While he was never charged with, or convicted of being, in a gang, he was kept in ICE detention while his case proceeded before an immigration judge.",,,,2025-04-04 16:05:44.287538

Those sponsoring this weekend’s rallies include dozens of advocacy organizations, including the AFL-CIO, Americans for Financial Reform, Common Cause, the Consumer Federation of America, Indivisible, and Planned Parenthood.
A website for the demonstrations explains their goal.
“Donald Trump and Elon Musk believe this country belongs to them,” it says. “They’re taking everything they can get their hands on, and daring the world to stop them. On Saturday, April 5th, we’re taking to the streets nationwide to fight back with a clear message: Hands Off!”
It adds, “A core principle of Hands Off! is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to de-escalate any potential confrontations with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events.”
In Ohio at least, protests are planned for Saturday and Sunday. One is slated for noon on Saturday on the Western Plaza of the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus. Others are planned for Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Akron, and Toledo, in addition to smaller cities and towns such as Portsmouth, Marietta, Sandusky, and others.
Mia Lewis of Common Cause Ohio provided a Facebook page listing the events that are being planned for the Buckeye State. It continues to be updated, she said.
“For many people, this will be the first protest they have attended,” Lewis said in an email. “They are coming out not to tear anything down, but to stand up for the Constitution, for the rule of law, for our democracy. Enough is enough!”
She added that a broad swath of Ohioans are expected.
“The folks planning to attend range from the elderly — I’ve had many questions about accessible parking — to young families bringing their children. Yes, WE THE PEOPLE are showing up to say enough is enough! Hands off our government and our democracy.”

And, Republicans argue, more secretive.
The state Senate voted to request that the two chambers form a conference committee for the operating budget.
If the House agrees, and it will in the next few days, six lawmakers – four Democrats and two Republicans – will be charged with reconciling differences in spending plans approved in each chamber. The chief budget writers for each caucus will serve on the panel.
Here’s the rub for the GOP. 
They know employing a conference committee at this stage is pretty much standard operating procedure. They did it when they were in the majority.
They also understand it isn’t like other committees. It won’t meet in public until there is a final version of the budget ready to be voted on. And whatever the committee delivers cannot be amended.
Republicans are unlikely to be invited to many meetings. Maybe none. Democrats will huddle behind closed doors with their leadership and strike deals. They can involve Republicans at any and every step if they want, but more likely they will brief them when they feel it is necessary.
“You’re going to have basically four legislators in a room likely making very dramatic changes to the operating budget, changes none of us will ever have a chance to amend,” Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, said on the Senate floor. Gildon is the lead Republican budget writer and will be a committee member.
“It is closed to the public. It is not transparent,” he said, adding “it will further erode trust in state government.”
Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee and the Democrats’ lead budget writer, disagreed with the characterization.
“The conference report process is something the Legislature does every year for the budget and other bills,” she said in a statement.
“I have worked closely with my Republican counterparts throughout the budget process and am open to discussions with them at any point going forward,” Robinson added. “All of that is taken into consideration in negotiations.”

Patrick Morrisey at the beginning of the session. With three members absent and not voting, the budget bill passed the House 80-17. Eight Republican delegates [&#8230;]","Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s proposed budget report, which differs greatly from the one proposed and approved by the House of Delegates on Friday, April 4, 2025. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia House of Delegates on Friday passed its version of the state budget for the upcoming year with several marked differences between the one initially requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey at the beginning of the session.
With three members absent and not voting, the budget bill passed the House 80-17. Eight Republican delegates — Dels. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley; Elias Coop-Gonzalez, R-Randolph; Henry Dillon, R-Wayne; Laura Kimble, R-Harrison; Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson; Adam Vance, R-Wyoming and Lisa White, R-Berkeley — joined the chamber’s nine Democrats in voting against the proposed budget.
As proposed, the House’s budget — House Bill 2026 — is based on the previous year’s budget, continuing a tradition of relatively “flat” budgets for the state of West Virginia. It totals about $5.127 billion in base spending.
Morrisey has been critical of this tradition of “flat” budgets. Before the legislative session started, he said the practice has been used to falsely inflate the state’s revenues, making it seem that there is more money on hand in the state through the use of one-time funds that go to necessary programs but that are not included in estimated spending needs.
He said former Gov. Jim Justice’s approach to the budget bred long-term problems that he was now inheriting. In January, Morrisey’s office projected that there would be a $400 million budget hole that lawmakers would need to contend with due to that reliance on one-time funds.
  Del. Vernon Criss, R-Wood
But Del. Vernon Criss, who serves as the chair of the House Committee on Finance, never believed that budget hole actually existed. On Friday, in response to questions from Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, who asked whether that $400 million budget deficit was still a factor in the proposed state budget, Criss reiterated his beliefs.
“It never was,” said Criss, R-Wood.
Earlier this year, Morrisey’s office estimated that revenues for the coming fiscal year would total around $5.323 billion. The governor’s version of the budget had all of those potential dollars being spent, making the largest difference between the House’s budget and Morrisey’s the inclusion of surplus funds. As proposed, the House’s budget holds nearly $129 million as surplus spending that could be allocated later if the funds remain available by the end of this fiscal year.
Criss, who has been vocally critical of Morrisey’s governorship throughout this session, said the governor’s proposed budget was problematic in that it didn’t include that “cushion” of surplus funds that can act as a safety net if revenue falls short and removed line items that allow the Legislature to better track funding allocations and the use of state dollars. 
“The governor’s budget was going to spend every dollar and not have any reserve account,” Criss said. “He also collapsed all of the line items, which takes away our job of making sure we are watching the dollars. We appropriate the dollars — that’s our job. When we got his budget, based upon his pro forma sheet, it was useless.” 
Proposed amendments and line item funding changes
Before its passage on Friday, members of the House considered 10 amendments to the proposed budget bill, adopting only two of them.
The first of those adopted amendments came from Del. Joe Statler, R-Monongalia, and added $2 million to the Office of Emergency Medical Services for training and support of the state’s EMS.
The second adopted amendment was introduced by Del. Michael Hite, R-Berkeley, and changed how funds are used and appropriated for several of the state Department of Human Services’ waiver programs, including the Intellectual and/or Developmental Disabilities Waiver program.
All of the other eight amendments voted down by lawmakers during the budget process were introduced by Democrats. All but one were voted down via voice vote.
If approved, those amendments would have:

Transferred $50 million into the West Virginia Flood Resiliency Trust Fund — a currently unfunded budget line — from the Revenue Shortfall Reserve Fund. With six members absent, lawmakers voted 75-19 against the amendment. Their vote came just weeks after devastating flooding hit the state’s southern coalfields, taking lives and damaging dozens of buildings beyond repair.
Added $10 million to the Water Development Authority to be used for improvements to the state’s many distressed and failing water systems.
Added $32 million in funding for child care subsidies, which lawmakers have stressed over the last two years are needed in the state. Despite that need — and requests from businesses to make the program a priority in order to support working parents — little work has been done by the Legislature on the issue and only about $6.3 million is currently allocated in the House’s budget for child care.
Put $20 million into workforce development grants to provide summer employment for teens. That fund is zeroed out in the House’s budget due to the expiration of federal funds.
Reinstated the state’s Herbert Henderson Office of Minority Affairs with a nearly $400,000 allocation. That office was completely removed in the budget in the wake of an executive order from Morrisey banning all diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state.
Added $5 million in funding for West Virginia State University. 
Added $15 million in funding for West Virginia University.
Increased various allocations to the state’s waiver programs, including an additional $1 million for the IDD Waiver program, $32 million for Title XIX for Seniors Citizens waiver program and $1.3 million for the Traumatic Brain Injury Waiver program.

The House’s proposed budget — as it remains flat — had only a few increases for budget lines throughout. House counsel said at a committee meeting earlier this week that one of those, an additional $30 million for the state Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, is “just to meet their operational requirements.”
Other increases include an additional $40 million for the employer share for the Public Employees Insurance Agency, $7 million for the Department of Health’s Birth to Three program, $1 million to the House and Senate for auditing services and a $7 million bump for the state’s HOPE Scholarship program, among other small increases. 
And while an additional $90 million is being allocated to the state Department of Human Services — replacing some dollars cut in last year’s budget — the department is still underfunded as it deals with an ongoing foster care crisis.
Under the House’s proposal, DoHS will receive just about $121 million for foster care. Morrisey’s budget had about $182 million for foster care, higher than what the House is offering but still less than what the department said it needs.
The agency also faces high vacancy rates of Child Protective Service workers, something the House took into consideration across the board in all agencies in its proposed budget. Agencies with continuously high vacancy rates, according to counsel for the House, were subject to a 2% budget reduction, totalling about $8 million in savings.
Other spending decreases in the House’s budget include an $11 million drop in state dollars in the school aid formula, a $15 million reduction in funds given to WVU and about a $1.2 million decrease in funds for the Judges Retirement Systems.
The Herbert Henderson Office of Minority Affairs no longer exists in the House’s budget while the Department of Arts, Culture and History is moving under the Department of Tourism, and the Department of Economic Development is joining with the Commerce Department. Those agency closures and mergers reflect about $300,000 in savings, according to previous budget presentations.
What’s next
With the House’s vote Friday, its version of the state budget heads to the Senate for consideration.
Meanwhile, however, the Senate is still considering its own version of the state budget, which looks much more similar to Morrisey’s initially proposed budget than the House’s.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on Finance approved the Senate’s budget proposal. That budget — Senate Bill 300 — is scheduled to be on first reading in the Senate on Monday. 
The Senate’s budget sticks with Morrisey’s proposed $5.3 billion in general revenue spending, however priorities for that spending look a bit different. 
During a press conference with reporters on Thursday, Morrisey said he wasn’t concerned that the two budget proposals circulating around the Legislature hold stark differences. In response to a question from Ogden Newspapers’ Steven Allen Adams, Morrisey said meetings have been occurring regularly between his team and leadership in both of the Legislature’s chambers.
“I think what you have here is a process,” Morrisey said. “The House has an important opinion, the Senate has an important opinion, the executive has an important opinion and so you have these three groups that come together and then you try to reach a budget that everyone agrees on.”
The Legislature is scheduled to adjourn sine die at midnight on Saturday, April 12.

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)The Iowa Dental Board has canceled a scheduled disciplinary hearing for a dentist who is alleged to have contributed to a patient’s death.
The board has also pulled from its website a previously published description of the alleged wrongdoing that led to the death.
In September 2024, the board notified dentist Robert Wolf of Swisher that it intended to deny his application for a permit to use moderate sedation on patients. At the time, the board alleged that on Jan. 26, 2024, Wolf had participated in dental surgery on a patient who suffered a medical emergency in the office and subsequently died.
The board alleged Wolf was the only dentist in the operating room while an advanced registered nurse practitioner administered and monitored anesthesia. “During the procedure, (Wolf) facilitated the practice of an unlicensed dentist and supervised the administration of anesthesia without having the proper credentials,” the board alleged.
One week after the death, Wolf filed his application for a permit to use moderate sedation on patients. After the board sent Wolf a “preliminary notice” announcing its intent to deny the application, Wolf indicated he intended to pursue the matter, and a hearing before the board was scheduled for this month.
Wolf subsequently withdrew his application and in March the board issued an order canceling the planned hearing.
In recent weeks, however, the board pulled from its website the September 2024 “preliminary notice” of its intent to deny the permit application, leaving no public filings in the case.
After the Iowa Capital Dispatch inquired about the missing documents, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing uploaded a November 2024 notice to deny Wolf’s permit application, as well as the March 2025 order canceling the planned hearing.
Neither of those documents includes any mention of a patient death or the alleged role Wolf played in that case.
Other dentist sanctioned by emergency order
Wolf is the second Iowa dentist to have faced board action as a result of the Jan. 26, 2024, procedure.
Last fall, nine months after the patient died, the board issued an emergency order restricting the practice of Dr. Jonathan Karch of the Dental Studio of Iowa in Johnston. The board alleged Karch participated in the procedure and that an investigation revealed Karch “did not stay in the operatory for the duration of the procedure.”
In issuing the emergency order, the board said it “recognizes (Karch) as an imminent threat to public safety” and that he “should not be permitted to participate in procedures involving sedation until further order.” Karch’s license to practice dentistry has remained otherwise unrestricted.
The status of the disciplinary case against Karch is unknown. A hearing on the matter was scheduled for Oct. 11, 2024, but a final decision in the matter has yet to be published by the board, and there’s no published notice of the hearing being rescheduled.
Separate from the licensing board actions, a civil lawsuit has been filed against Karch, Wolf and others involved in the surgery, all of whom have denied any wrongdoing.
The lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court by the family of Joseph Daniels, alleges that on Jan. 26, 2024, after Daniels received dental implants from Karch, patient care was turned over to a certified registered nurse anesthetist who was tasked with waking Daniels and initiating the recovery process.
The lawsuit alleges that at 3:30 p.m., a dental assistant notified Karch and Wolf they were needed in the surgical suite through a message that stated, “Joe is not doing well — please come immediately.”
According to EMS medical records, paramedics were dispatched to Dental Studio of Iowa at 3:35 p.m. with a report of an “unconscious person.” Within 25 minutes of their arrival and the administration of drugs, the paramedics had intubated Daniels, and by 4:27 they had initiated chest compressions, the lawsuit claims. Daniels was then taken to Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died at 5:51 p.m.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages for negligence. In their response to the lawsuit, lawyers for the defendants argue that Daniels caused his own death which they say stemmed from pre-existing conditions.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez announced Friday the state has joined 18 others in a new lawsuit against President Donald J. Trump, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the federal Election Assistance Commission and other Trump Administration officials over Trump’s executive order regarding elections, which includes new rules requiring voters produce proof of citizenship and that all mail-in ballots be received by Election Day.
The lawsuit contends the measures in the order violate the U.S. Constitution.
“This executive order is an unconstitutional power grab that threatens the very foundation of our democracy,” Torrez said in a statement. “The President has no authority to rewrite state election laws or impose arbitrary barriers to voting. New Mexico will not stand by while the federal government oversteps its bounds and undermines the right of every eligible voter to have their voice heard. We are taking this fight to court to protect the integrity of our elections and defend the fundamental principles of our democracy.”
New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver echoed those sentiments in a statement about the executive order, calling it a “blatant overreach by the federal government into our country’s decentralized system of voting that would weaken our elections and make it harder for eligible voters to make their voices heard.”
The lawsuit specifically challenges:
• requiring state voter agencies to assess citizenship prior to “providing a federal voter registration form to enrollees of public assistance programs”
• forcing states to change their ballot-counting procedures to exclude absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day
• requiring military and overseas voters to provide proof of citizenship
• threatening to withhold federal funding from non-complying states
The order “interferes with States’ inherent sovereignty and their constitutional power to regulate the time, place, and manner of federal elections,” the lawsuit says. “It also usurps Congress’s powers to legislate (under the Elections Clause) and to appropriate (under the Spending Clause) because Congress has not chosen to implement the changes the President seeks to impose by decree. The critical funds at issue have in large measure already been appropriated by Congress. And if these coercive threats were not enough, the Elections EO threatens to target Plaintiff States with Department of Justice investigations and potential prosecution.”
The lawsuit goes on to say that “it bears emphasizing: the President has no power to do any of this.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dona-Ana-County-Vote-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733
,DC,2025-04-04 19:02:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration funding freeze of $27B clean-energy program strands local projects,Allison Prang,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-funding-freeze-27b-clean-energy-program-strands-local-projects,,"WASHINGTON — A multibillion-dollar Environmental Protection Agency program designed to spur investment in energy-efficiency improvements nationwide is tied up in a legal battle that threatens to upend planned projects across the United States focused on affordable housing, the adoption of electric vehicles and more.The EPA last month said it was terminating grants tied to the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a program Congress created as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, “based on substantial concerns regarding… program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with agency’s priorities.” President Joe Biden signed the act into law.Funds had already been dispersed into awardees’ bank accounts at Citibank as part of the program.But the Trump administration, according to a document shared related to the lawsuit, directed Citi to freeze activity on those accounts. As a result, organizations around the country either already awarded money or in advanced talks to obtain funding are unable to access capital for planned projects.The projects run the gamut, focusing on anything from installing energy-efficient technology in affordable housing units with the aim of lowering residents’ utility bills to adding solar panels to schools.“There will be … very real capacity constraints if the funding is frozen indefinitely,” said Kari Groth Swan, executive director of the Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority, a state body that finances clean-energy projects.Groth Swan’s organization was awarded $25 million from the Coalition for Green Capital, one of the groups allocated funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.Seeding energy-efficiency projectsThe goal of the fund is to catalyze investment in energy-efficiency technology and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases.“We loan it out, we get it back, we do it again,” Groth Swan said. “It acts like a revolving loan fund.”The Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority is one of many betting on funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to help get these projects off the ground. Organizations have been relying on this money to further pad much larger funding pools that include capital from outside investors.In Minnesota, for example, the $25 million the Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority was awarded from the federal program makes up about one-fifth of the capital Groth Swan is planning to go toward a host of projects.They include making an old school that’s being turned into a workforce development site more energy efficient and putting solar and storage technology on schools in north Minneapolis to keep the lights on during severe weather, according to Groth Swan.Her organization also plans to loan money to an ice hockey arena for a new electric cooling system so it can stop using a toxin the EPA wants ice rinks to get rid of, she said.Suit to unfreeze fundsThe Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority is one of several organizations that last month sued both the EPA and Citibank over the freezing of money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.The fund drew ire from Republicans long before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Democrats, who held majorities in both chambers of Congress and the White House in 2022, passed the law creating the program without any Republicans supporting it.After Trump’s return to office, his EPA said it was terminating $20 billion in grants from the fund, and recipients sued to retain the funding.A federal judge last month ruled that Citibank couldn’t move any of the federal funding in question out of the accounts, stating that the agency hadn’t provided “credible evidence” that there was “waste, fraud, or abuse” associated with the grant agreements.When an attorney for the Department of Justice was asked in court last month whether he could provide evidence that the law had been violated through conflicts of interest or fraud, the attorney said he did not have that. The attorneys listed as representing the EPA didn’t respond to a request for comment and an EPA spokesperson said in an email that it doesn’t comment on pending litigation.The court on April 2 held a hearing over the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, but a judge has yet to hand down a ruling.Citibank did keep the money in awardees’ accounts, said Brooke Durham, a spokesperson for Climate United, one of the funding awardees and plaintiffs in the lawsuit. But one thing Durham and others expressed concern about is the uncertainty surrounding the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund money affecting other investors in these projects.“There are a lot of people counting on these investments across the field all the way from developers to community lenders to private capital,” Durham said.Citibank declined to comment.EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, on the same day the judge issued a temporary restraining order, addressed the Greenhouse Reduction Fund in a post on the social media platform X, alleging the grants were “riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending.”“I will not rest until these hard-earned taxpayer dollars are returned to the U.S. Treasury,” he said in the post.A letter from the EPA to the agency’s inspector general last month raised concerns with the structure of the grant awards and bank account agreements and alleged that a grant awarded to a Biden official’s former employer violated conflict-of-interest standards.

Seeking alternativesThe temporary restraining order hasn’t stopped potential funding recipients from trying to find alternative funding to keep their projects going.Megan Lasch, owner and president of Texas-based affordable housing organization firm O-SDA Industries, said her organization was going through the process to get $4 million in funding from one of the groups already given funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for a $30 million affordable housing renovation in southwest Fort Worth.The project is focused on renovating 116 homes, most of which are two and three-bedroom units. Lasch’s company is aiming to lower residents’ utility bills by installing things like energy-efficient light fixtures and more efficient heating and air-conditioning systems.“It’s really important dollars that a lot of developers, real estate professionals are utilizing in their capital stack to help create and preserve affordable housing,” Lasch said.Lasch said her firm called in a favor from another nonprofit organization as a “Hail Mary” to get a loan to fill a potential void from the federal money O-SDA was counting on, but the plan is to pay the organization back. She’s not optimistic other projects will be able to move ahead without the federal funding, though, she said.“I think there’s going to be several developments that just don’t happen because there’s not another source that can get some of these deals done now,” she said.Rising costs for consumersSimilarly to Lasch, Homewise, a housing-focused developer and financial firm based in New Mexico, was also working on procuring money from different programs under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and had moved forward in the due diligence process, according to deputy CEO Johanna Gilligan.Gilligan said she hopes that either the state or philanthropic organizations could step in to help fill the funding void.Homewise’s plan is to use the money for a program to help low- to moderate-income homeowners in big cities like Albuquerque and Santa Fe reduce their utility expenses by undertaking energy-efficiency upgrades, she said.As part of that program, Homewise sends representatives out to people’s houses to help them understand where they’re losing energy and how they could lower their costs. That person might explain what tax credits or rebates people can use, Gilligan said. She described the program as “a one-stop shop for energy-efficiency improvements” and said the goal of the organization is to make these processes simpler for everyday people to understand.“That’s the real loss here,” she said. “For working-class people and those who are contributing significantly to the economy, often … this change makes it harder to help those folks to in turn be able to improve their homes and save money on their bills.”Robert Sheppard, the co-founder of Vital Housing, an affordable housing investment firm that does work in the Pacific Northwest, said his firm was awarded a 3% interest loan from one of the organizations awarded funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The plan is to use the $1.5 million loan to reduce carbon emissions and energy use in an affordable housing project in Portland, Oregon, to limit residents’ utility costs.“We don’t have a source to replace the financing at this point,” said Sheppard, who has raised a total of $24 million for the project. Without the federal funding, residents would see higher energy costs, he said.“We would not do the work that is scheduled to be done, which would leave carbon exposure and maintain energy costs at a level that is above where it should be for the residents and the building,” he said.Dollars aside, some of the recipients of the federal money expressed concern that even if the funds do become available for withdrawal again, the agency’s posture toward the program could still be problematic for them.“We can win the battle of getting the funds unfrozen but we still (have) to make sure that we have a(n) EPA that understands the value of our mission and our mandate,” Minnesota’s Groth Swan said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

Wes Moore (D) plans to issue an executive order Friday that could delay initial penalties for electric vehicle manufacturers who do not meet sales goals under a prescriptive state plan that is supposed to take effect next year.,"Gov. Wes Moore (D) takes a spin in an electric Mustang outside the Montgomery Park development in Baltimore Monday. Photo from the Executive Office of the Governor.Gov. Wes Moore (D) plans to issue an executive order Friday that could delay initial penalties for electric vehicle manufacturers who do not meet sales goals under a prescriptive state plan that is supposed to take effect next year.
The order will maximize the Maryland Department of Environment’s enforcement discretion “to ease compliance” with the rule – including the possibility of postponing penalties.
The order echoes a bill proposed this year by Del. Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) that would prevent penalties from being assessed in model years 2027 and 2028, the sources said.
Stein’s bill is advancing in the final days of the General Assembly session. It received an initial approval from the House of Delegates Friday.
Maryland adopted a California program called Advanced Clean Cars II, which requires that electric vehicles account for 43% of cars sold in the state by a manufacturer in the 2027 model year. The number grows to  51% in model year 2028, eventually reaching 100% by the 2035 model year.
Stein has argued that the state is behind on attaining the required percentage of EVs, and expressed concern that auto manufacturers will send fewer cars to Maryland to comply with the rule.

(Courtesy photos) Two Republican state Appeals Court judges on a three-judge panel agreed with their colleague that thousands of votes in his race for a seat on the state Supreme Court were improperly included in vote totals. 
The 2-1 ruling gives GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin a boost in his effort to unseat incumbent Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs. Riggs’ 734-vote lead was reaffirmed by two recounts. In his effort to win, Griffin wants more than 60,000 votes thrown out. He sued the state Board of Elections, claiming that counting those votes is against the law. 
Republican Appeals Court Judges John Tyson and Fred Gore agreed with Griffin. They wrote that they could order those votes thrown out, but would give most voters the chance to fix deficiencies. 
They ordered the state Board of Elections to notify voters of problems. Voters will have 15 business days once the Board sends the notices to “cure” deficiencies, either by providing a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number if those numbers are missing on their voter registration forms, or by providing the copy of a photo or a photo ID exemption form if they were military or overseas absentee voters. 
Riggs said in a statement that she will appeal.

“We will be promptly appealing this deeply misinformed decision that threatens to disenfranchise more than 65,000 lawful voters and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing disappointed politicians to thwart the will of the people,” Riggs said in a statement. 
“North Carolinians elected me to keep my seat and I swore an oath to the constitution and the rule of law – so I will continue to stand up for the rights of voters in this state and stand in the way of those who would take power from the people.”
The next step will likely be an appeal to the seven-member state Supreme Court, where Republicans hold a 5-2 majority. Riggs has recused herself, and three of the Republican justices have already indicated support for Griffin’s arguments. 
The state Republican Party said in a statement that the Court of Appeals vindicated Griffin’s election integrity protests.
“The decision and the order finally holds the NC State Board of Elections accountable for their actions and confirms every legal vote will be counted in this contest,” the NC GOP statement says. 
“For months, Judge Griffin and the NCGOP have endured baseless and incendiary rhetoric in this matter. Throughout this time, our position has been consistent, when the debate is about the merits, Judge Griffin will prevail in his election integrity concerns.”
State Democratic Party chair Anderson Clayton issued a statement blasting the opinion.
“Today, Republican judges Tyson and Gore put party affiliation above the rights of North Carolina voters. In an unsigned, partisan decision, they legitimized Jefferson Griffin’s unconstitutional challenge to more than 66,000 voters, and held that those voters should be forced to comply with requirements that did not exist at the time of the election. Republicans are trying to change the rules because they lost the game,” said Clayton.
A lengthy dissent
The Democrat on the three-member panel, Judge Tobias Hampson, supported the election board’s decisions.
In a 66-page dissent, Hampson wrote that voters followed the rules they were given and had every expectation that their votes would count. 
“Changing the rules by which these lawful voters took part in our electoral process after the election to discard their otherwise valid votes in an attempt to alter the outcome of only one race among many on the ballot is directly counter to law, equity, and the Constitution,” Hampson wrote. 
Griffin is challenging three sets of ballots. He claims that more than 60,000 voters were not properly registered because they did not include either a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number on their forms. Voters Griffin is challenging have come forward in the past months to say they did provide that information, but it was excluded from the electronic voter file due to typos or data mismatches.
The court’s majority opinion said the state and county elections boards should have told voters that those numbers were missing. 
“The Board and county boards failed in their duty to contact existing improperly registered voters whose electronic records omitted or did not show a driver’s license number or social security number to cure the information deficiency,” they wrote. Voters in this category will have 15 days once the election board notices go out to provide the information. 
Military and overseas voters
Griffin is also challenging the votes of more than 5,500 military and overseas absentee voters because they did not provide voter ID with their ballots. These voters are from a handful of overwhelmingly Democratic counties. The state Board of Elections does not require military and overseas voters to submit a copy of their photo ID. Griffin’s lawyers say the elections board is wrong to exempt those absentee voters from the photo ID requirement. A lawyer for Riggs said during the Appeals Court hearing last month that no other state requires military and overseas absentee voters to provide ID, and the portals that most of those voters use don’t have a way to submit them. These voters will also have 15 days to provide a copy of an ID or a photo ID exemption form. 
Lastly, Griffin is challenging a few hundred ballots from overseas absentee voters who have never lived in North Carolina, but who are connected to the state through their parents. The majority Appeals Court opinion said that these votes should be removed from the count because these voters do not have the right to vote in non-federal elections.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Riggs-Griffin-900.jpg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

Maine families are wrestling with a dire lack of child care options, particularly in more rural parts of the state. 
Rep. Holly Eaton (D-Deer Isle) has proposed a pilot project that would offer tuition grants for rural Mainers interested in getting into child care or an early childhood profession to complete their education, and additional funds to open their own facility.
That proposal, LD 1280, was one of the five bills aimed at better serving Maine children and families discussed before the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee on Friday. 
The two-part pilot project would require a one time appropriation of $600,000 and would target individuals who are not eligible for the state’s free community college program. 
Eaton said operating the programs as a pilot would give the state a chance to collect data and explore scalable solutions to address the child care shortage that affects the entire state but is particularly acute in rural Maine. 
According to the Maine Center for Economic Policy, an estimated 18,000 people in Maine are currently out of the labor force due to a lack of child care. 
Part of the challenge is that providers are struggling to stay afloat as they are often caught between wanting to keep costs down for families while paying their staff sufficient wages.
One proposal meant to support child care centers came from Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot). LD 1191 seeks to ensure that child care providers who accept children in the state’s foster care system receive timely reimbursement from the Department of Health and Human Services. 
His bill would require the department to pay invoices from a child care provider within 15 days of receipt, as well as offer guidance to providers to ensure they are filing invoices correctly to receive prompt payment. There are also annual reporting requirements about the timeliness of these payments. 
This bill comes after recent reports of untimely payments, though Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services, said the vast majority of disbursements are being made on time. She spoke with the Health and Human Services Committee just last month about this issue and the reasons her agency has identified behind such delays.
Currently, there is an average of five days between the time invoices are entered into the agency’s system and they are paid, Johnson said Friday. She added that 99% of all payments are already being paid within that 15-day window outlined in the bill. 
Betsey Grant, who owns Tiny Tikes Daycare in Trenton and has served nearly 60 foster children in the past few years, said timely reimbursement is important, but argued it’s even more important for providers to be paid in advance, which is common practice for families not involved in the child welfare system.
Investing in prevention 
The committee also heard testimony on two bills that would bolster support for parents and help prevent child abuse. 
Meyer sponsored LD 1060, which would provide $100,000 in one time funding for the Be There for ME campaign, which launched last year to help reduce the stigma associated with parents asking for help. 
The campaign also includes a website that provides resources in a dozen different languages for housing or behavioral health services, as well as offers peer support from other parents in Maine. 
She also introduced LD 1061, which would provide $1.5 million in ongoing annual funding for the statewide network of abuse prevention councils under the Maine Children’s Trust. The councils work in all 16 of Maine’s counties building community resources and offering important training for parents but, according to Executive Director Heidi Aakjer, funding for the trust hasn’t increased in more than 15 years.
While no one testified against either bill, multiple parents and individuals involved with the abuse prevention councils spoke in support, describing them as valuable resources for families in Maine. They told the committee that investing in the prevention of abuse could not only strengthen and preserve families, but prevent the higher costs of a child entering state custody. 
Reunification
A final bill discussed before the committee Friday was LD 1108, introduced by Rep. Abigail Griffin (R-Levant) to strengthen the reunification process for children in state custody in cases where the parents struggle with substance use disorder. 
The legislation would implement random drug screening for those parents, as well as ensure that certain reunification meetings are scheduled at times that work for the parents. However, Johnson said these are already standard practices for the child welfare agency when substance use is a factor in removing the child. 
The proposal would also prohibit the state from petitioning a court to return custody to the parent sooner than six months after the child was removed from the home. Johnson raised constitutional concerns with this, explaining that there is an established judicial process and cautioned that each case comes with unique circumstances.

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.

The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

(Photo by Dan Reynolds Photography/Getty Images)Midway through the 2025 legislative session, large majorities of Granite Staters say they support legislation aimed at expanding housing in the state, according to a poll commissioned by New Hampshire Housing Action, an advocacy group.
According to the poll, conducted in early March by YouGov, 88% of respondents said they would support legislation to allow residential homes to be built in commercial zones; 76% would support laws requiring cities and towns to allow homes to be built on smaller lot sizes; and 76% would support allowing property owners to build detached accessory dwelling units by right.
The poll found that 55% of respondents considered New Hampshire’s housing shortage and high prices to be the number one issue facing Granite Staters, surpassing inflation, taxes, homelessness, health care costs, and immigration. And 80% said the cost of housing is “a problem” in the state.
“The message is clear: New Hampshire is experiencing a severe housing shortage that is being felt from southern New Hampshire to the North Country and all across the state,” Nick Taylor, director of Housing Action NH, said in a statement.
The poll was released as lawmakers are considering a number of bills aimed at increasing housing development by requiring cities and towns to change zoning policies seen as barriers to construction.
One bill, House Bill 577, would allow the construction of detached accessory units — additional units that are not directly attached to the primary resident — by right, stopping cities and towns from passing zoning ordinances that automatically exclude them. Another, House Bill 382, would restrict the minimum number of parking spaces a municipality could require of housing developments to one space per unit, in an attempt to block what some developers say are unnecessary burdens.
Senate Bill 284 would also limit the minimum number parking spaces in town zoning codes, while Senate Bill 84 would block cities and towns from setting minimum lot sizes of more than one acre for residential homes serviced by sewer and water lines — for at least 50% of residential zoned land. And House Bill 631 would allow property owners in commercial zones to build residential units, while allowing cities and towns to impose some restrictions. 
HB 577, HB 382, and HB 631 have passed the House and are currently being considered in the Senate Commerce Committee. SB 284 and SB 84 have passed the Senate and are being taken up in the House Housing Committee. 
The bills have the support of affordable housing advocates and industry groups in construction, such as the New Hampshire Homebuilders Association and Housing Action New Hampshire. But they have drawn criticism from the New Hampshire Municipal Association, which represents cities and towns, and another conservative group, the Coalition of New Hampshire Taxpayers. Opponents say the bills improperly insert the state into local zoning code decisions, and that municipalities should be allowed to decide how best to change their codes to expand housing. 
Gov. Kelly Ayotte has vowed to help combat the housing crisis in part by directing state agencies such as the Department of Environmental Services and the Fish and Game Department to speed up their permitting processes, promising to guarantee the state permitting process takes no more than 60 days for developers. 
But the House Finance Committee’s recommended version of the state’s two budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, makes a number of cuts to agencies and programs designed to help expand housing. The budget eliminates the state’s housing appeals board, a recently created entity designed to speed up developers’ appeals of adverse zoning and planning board rulings, and it defunds the Housing Champion Designation and Grant Program, which gives towns and cities grants and special benefits if they voluntarily overhaul their zoning to encourage more housing.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/housingconstruct-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal prosecutor says in court filings that the former leader of a Kansas foster care agency should not be allowed to attend his daughter’s high school graduation in El Salvador because he is a flight risk.
Robert “Father Bobby” Smith, the former Saint Francis Ministries CEO who is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering, asked the court last month to visit his ex-wife and daughter in June in El Salvador. Court filings also show he has entered into plea negotiations.
Smith was required to surrender his passport as a condition of his pretrial release. Skip Jacobs, an assistant U.S. attorney in Topeka, said Friday in a court filing that the passport condition is “not flexible.”
“Given the defendant’s charges, potential sentencing outcomes, connections and family ties to El Salvador, and severe limitations available to the government to extradite defendant from El Salvador should he flee, the government submits the prohibition of defendant maintaining or possessing a passport cannot be removed without creating significant risk of flight,” Jacobs wrote.
A federal grand jury indicted Smith in 2022 following an investigation into alleged financial misconduct. Federal authorities have accused Smith and a co-defendant of conspiring to defraud the foster care agency through fraudulent billing of IT services, and accused Smith of fraudulently using company credit cards to pay for personal expenses. He faces up to 20 years in prison for the conspiracy and wire fraud charges, and up to 10 years for the money laundering charge.
As CEO of Saint Francis, Smith hired his wife, Angela, as vice president and director of international ministries. In that role, she purchased and developed a 55-acre farm in El Salvador with the stated purpose of producing the “moringa” fruit as a new revenue stream for Saint Francis. Smith approved more than $2 million in spending to support her efforts, but the farm never turned a profit, according to court filings.
An internal investigation following Smith’s departure from Saint Francis found that a project manager in El Salvador had asked for and received a credit card so he could use cash advances to bribe government officials. However, the cards were used almost entirely for small purchases of fast food and lodging.
Former Saint Francis accountant Jamie Palenski said she could not identify the purpose of Angela Smith’s numerous trips to El Salvador, and social media posts identify Angela Smith being on the beach while supposedly on business, Jacobs wrote.
Angela Smith has traveled to El Salvador about 20 times in the past three years, Jacobs wrote, apparently spending enough time there to enroll her daughter in a school.
Robert Smith, who now lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, asked the court to fly on June 13 into El Salvador. He would attend his daughter’s high school graduation at Colegio Internacional de San Salvador and would stay at an Airbnb near the apartment where his ex-wife lives with their three other daughters in San Benito. After graduation, the family would travel to the beach community of Los Cobanos. He would re-surrender his passport upon return June 17.
Jacobs said a treaty between the U.S. and El Salvador allows the U.S. to request extradition if Robert Smith were arrested under El Salvador laws. However, there is no agreement that would require El Salvadorian law enforcement to aid in his apprehension.
“In other words, the United States cannot task El Salvador to go and arrest the defendant for the purpose of extradition,” Jacobs wrote. “As such, were defendant to flee to El Salvador, there is little the United States could do legally to ensure his return to the United States.”
“The risk of flight if defendant is allowed to travel to El Salvador is too great,” Jacobs added.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SFM1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

Photo by Senate Media Services.On March 24, Minnesota Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, introduced a bill (SF2978) providing a $1 million grant to 21 Days of Peace, a violence prevention group headed by the Rev. Jerry McAfee.
Sitting next to McAfee at a Jobs and Economic Development hearing on April 2, Champion praised the pastor’s group as an organization “dedicated to reducing violence and supporting individuals re-entering the workforce and providing holistic, culturally responsive services to at-risk youth and adults.”
What neither Champion nor McAfee mentioned during the hearing: Starting in 2022, Champion, in his private capacity as an attorney, represented McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. in four court cases involving nonpayment of mortgages on multiple Minneapolis properties, totaling roughly half a million dollars.
That period overlaps with the 2023-24 legislative session, when lawmakers gave a $3 million grant to McAfee’s nonprofit. 
Champion was the chief author of that bill as well. 
Champion says that his work on the mortgage cases was pro-bono, and that because it concluded in December 2022, prior to the start of the legislative session, he did not need to disclose the relationship to the public or to his colleagues. 
“There would be no need to disclose a work relationship which had already concluded at that time, and which provides no financial benefit to me,” he said through a spokesperson.
But at least two of the cases did not have final judgments issued until March or April of 2023, after Champion had introduced the funding bill and lawmakers held a hearing on it.
McAfee, in an interview with the Reformer, refused to say whether he paid Champion for his legal services: “I won’t answer that,” he said. “Is there something on the books that would prevent me from hiring him as an attorney?”
Champion says he keeps records of his pro-bono clients, but declined to share the relevant portions.
Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota Law School professor who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said Champion’s actions represent a “clear” conflict of interest.
“Nobody should sponsor a bill in the Legislature favoring a client, pro-bono or not, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “It’s a basic principle that in a legislative body, if there is a bill that’s going to help your client, you say, ‘This is my client.’”
In December 2023, after Champion successfully spearheaded the effort to steer $3 million to McAfee’ nonprofit, McAfee and his wife each donated $1,000 to Champion’s campaign committee, the maximum allowed under state law.
Legal troubles
  Certificate of Representation showing Sen. Bobby Joe Champion as the attorney for Jerry McAfee and Salem Inc. in a 2022 court case.
In the spring and early summer of 2022, McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. were sued by multiple creditors alleging mortgage nonpayment on four Minneapolis properties, totaling nearly half a million dollars. 
McAfee says the mortgage issues stemmed from his work helping people in his community obtain housing.
“One of the things I do is I put people in homes,” he said. “I certainly don’t make the best business decisions. But if I have to sacrifice myself to get people in houses, I’d do it all over again.”
Champion represented McAfee and Salem on the cases. In September 2022, all parties agreed to have the disputes mediated by a third-party law firm.
Champion says his work on the cases concluded in December 2022, before the start of the legislative session.
But final notices of dismissal of the cases weren’t issued until February 6, 2023. Final judgments were filed between February 8 and April 18. 
Champion introduced the bill steering $3 million to McAfee’s organization on March 16, and presented it to the Jobs and Economic Development Committee on March 20.
At that hearing, Champion spoke in glowing terms about the work McAfee’s organization was doing. He did not mention his work representing McAfee in court. In response to a question from Sen. Rich Draheim, R-Madison Lake, Champion said that the Senate bill had a companion in the House.
But no companion bill is listed on the Office of the Revisor’s website. The funding was nevertheless included in the final jobs bill that passed that year.
Another request for funding
Champion is listed as the attorney for McAfee and Salem Inc. on three additional cases filed in May 2023 involving some of the same properties. Several of those cases show filings through 2024 and 2025. But Champion says he never worked on them, and that he’s listed due to an error by the plaintiff’s attorney, who assumed he was still representing McAfee.
“When a separate matter was filed in 2023, the plaintiffs attorney initially listed me as defense counsel on the presumption I was still active in that role,” Champion said. “However, I communicated to that attorney that I was not working for the defense, and did no work on the subsequent case.”
In recent months, the city of Minneapolis pulled a violence prevention contract issued to McAfee’s nonprofit after City Council members alleged he threatened them and made homophobic remarks, and two of McAfee’s violence interrupters were charged over their involvement in a north Minneapolis shooting.
McAfee has maintained the violence interrupters were acting in self-defense.
Those recent controversies were enough to prompt Republican lawmakers to ask pointed questions at this month’s hearing for the additional $1 million in funding for McAfee’s group. Champion defended McAfee’s actions toward the Minneapolis City Council. 
He did not mention his previous legal work on McAfee’s behalf.
A group of legislators from both parties recently urged their colleagues to end the practice of steering grants to favored nonprofit groups, citing a lack of oversight and accountability.
In 2014, Republicans in the Senate filed an ethics complaint against Champion, in part over his work as an attorney representing a community member who founded a nonprofit that received grant funding from the Minneapolis School District. They alleged that Champion threatened to withhold state aid from the school district if it did not award the grant to his client’s organization.
The Senate Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct deadlocked over whether or not to pursue those allegations.

In fact, it would add more to the deficit than all four of these major laws combined.”That deficit impact, CRFB wrote, “would be the equivalent of adding a large new welfare program to the federal deficit.”No Democratic votes neededRepublicans in Congress must adopt a budget resolution in order to use the complex reconciliation process to pass many of their core campaign promises.The special legislative pathway will let the GOP enact changes without needing the support of Democrats to get past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.The largest deficit increase within the package would come from extending the 2017 GOP tax law, about $4.5 trillion in deficits, and likely making other changes to the U.S. tax code, about $1.5 trillion.House Republicans want to try to offset some of that $6 trillion total in new deficits by cutting about $1.5 trillion in federal spending, though exactly how they’d do that remains under discussion.Centrist Republicans in Congress have raised concerns about the House’s instructions calling on the Energy and Commerce Committee to find at least $880 billion in spending cuts.That panel oversees Medicare and Medicaid and couldn’t reach that level of spending cuts without making some substantial changes to one or both of the programs.GOP leaders and President Donald Trump have repeatedly said they won’t touch Medicare, leaving Medicaid, the state-federal program for lower-income people, as the likely source of the funding cuts.Senate GOP approachSenate Republicans wrote themselves a much lower threshold for cutting government spending in the budget resolution —  a $4 billion minimum from four different committees across the 10-year budget window.The Senate instructions, CRFB wrote in its analysis, “would allow a reconciliation bill that is nearly as large as the largest federal spending programs.“A bill adding $5.8 trillion to deficits would be more than three-quarters (77 percent) as large as all projected Medicaid spending. It would equal 69 percent of base defense spending over the same time period, including being three times as large as projected spending dedicated to the Army. It would even equal half of all net spending on Medicare and a third of all spending on Social Security.”CRFB wrote that Congress should change its course now.“Instead of passing a bill with an historically large deficit impact, lawmakers should use this opportunity to rein in borrowing with a fiscally responsible package that can set the stage for a permanent package of thoughtful tax extensions and budget savings that grows the economy and improves our debt outlook.”The Senate is expected to vote sometime this weekend to approve the compromise budget resolution and send it back to the House for final approval.Once both chambers vote to adopt it, they can formally begin writing, debating, amending and voting to approve the reconciliation package.",,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

(Courtesy of Van DeWald/National Weather Service via NWS Omaha Facebook page)LINCOLN —  Some in Nebraska’s federal delegation are seeking answers about recent cuts steered by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to the national agency responsible for monitoring local weather.
Last month, the Trump administration cut 1,000 jobs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, which includes the National Weather Service. Those cuts reached home when the Weather Service office for the Omaha area and other Great Plains offices recently announced pausing the deployment of weather balloons after the department cuts. 
Weather balloons are a key tool in forecasting; Midwestern meteorologists say the data loss will likely lead to forecasting challenges in a region known for volatile, unpredictable weather as much of the area prepares for tornadoes and severe storms.
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to express his concern about the plan to lay off personnel at the NOAA following the recent wave of deadly storms across the country.
“NOAA plays a significant role in the protection of Nebraskans from dangerous weather events – especially tornadoes, blizzards, and flooding,” Bacon’s letter reads. 
Nebraska experienced a blizzard last month, which caused Gov. Jim Pillen to declare a state of emergency for 24 counties. The damage estimates from the blizzard continue to climb, now at $53 million.
Last month, Bacon said he would “press the White House” to restore the Weather Service office’s ability to deploy weather balloons. U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., went to the Omaha office to discuss the recent cuts with meteorologists. 
The Omaha office’s head meteorologist said the office has been about half-staffed for more than a year during a press conference late last month. Officials said the Omaha office opted to suspend weather balloon launches to focus on real-time analysis and tracking potential severe weather.
NOAA already laid off several hundred employees before the latest cuts by the Trump Administration. NWS also reduced launches to once a day at six other offices. Current NOAA staff aren’t authorized to speak with the media about the suspension of weather balloon flights. 
When the Examiner contacted the Valley office, a spokesperson said it is “dedicated to providing watches, warnings, advisories and other weather information for the protection of life and property” and directed questions about cuts to the national office.

The national public affairs office did not respond to a request to comment about the Omaha-area weather station cuts. The rest of Nebraska’s all-GOP delegation expressed concerns about grounding the weather balloons. 
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., said her office will be “monitoring the situation.” U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., told the Examiner he is “seeking information from the weather service to ensure Nebraskans continue to have access to timely, accurate weather notifications.”
Eric Hunt, an agricultural meteorologist with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, told Nebraska Public Media that the “worst-case scenario” involves forecasting accuracy returning to its 2000s levels because it would lead to shorter warning times for potential severe weather and less accurate long-term forecasts.
Flood said he plans to meet with the agency soon and look into Congress’s option to restore “this vital service.”

Josh Stein to halt Duke Energy’s fossil fuel expansion and what they called the “suppression of renewable energy solutions” with his executive authority, according to a press release.
Four public health and climate scientists, along with the Center for Biological Diversity and solar nonprofit advocacy group NC WARN, organized the letter. It’s signed by a total of 61 scientists from universities and agencies across the country, some of which are at Duke University or the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.
The letter asks Stein to prevent Duke Energy, what the letter authors termed “the third-largest corporate climate polluter in the United States,” from delaying transitions from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
The town of Carrboro, N.C. sued Duke Energy at the end of last year, alleging the company’s top executives have misled the public about climate science and its harms for decades.
“Duke Energy executives are brushing aside scientists’ warnings and Gov. Stein needs to step in for the sake of people and our planet,” Drew Shindell, Ph.D., a climate scientist at Duke University and lead author on two U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, said in a statement. “The science is clear that as long as we keep burning fossil fuels, climate disasters like Helene and extreme heat waves will keep getting worse. These disasters will cost lives, drive species extinct and obliterate many of the places we call home. This is urgent and Gov. Stein has a responsibility to use all the tools at his disposal to force mega-polluters like Duke Energy to do what’s best for North Carolinians.”
The company possesses one of the biggest planned gas buildouts of any utility for the decade. Duke Energy recently announced its intent to consider delaying retiring its coal fleet as a result of the Trump administration’s climate protection rollbacks.
Historically, Duke Energy has not invested into local renewable energy solutions, like rooftop and community solar, according to the press release. The company generates only 1.4% of its power from solar energy.
“Duke Energy’s reckless expansion of fossil gas is costing lives and saddling North Carolinians with skyrocketing utility bills and deadlier extreme weather. Trump and his billionaire buddies are throwing communities and our climate under the bus, so we desperately need Gov. Stein to step up and challenge the polluters putting our planet in peril,” Gaby Sarri-Tobar, senior energy justice campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.
In response, a spokesperson for Duke Energy declined to address the scientists’ contention directly. “We are committed to our customers and communities and will continue working with policymakers, regulators and other state leaders to deliver reliable and increasingly clean energy while keeping rates as low as possible,” Duke Energy lead communications manager Garrett Poorman told NC Newsline.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roxboro-aerial-SELC-1024x634.webp,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Cathy Williams is a retired teacher and lifelong voter, but she had never been politically active. 
That changed with the second term of President Donald Trump and the rise of the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk.
Now she’s an organizer of a Grand Forks chapter of a national group behind protests of the Trump administration on Saturday. 
“I’ve never been terrified before,” she said.

Ed Schafer, a former Cabinet secretary and North Dakota Republican governor, said he believes people want the smaller federal government Musk and Trump are trying to create. But he said he knows many people don’t agree with the means to that end. 
“To be successful, you have to build public trust, and I don’t see that,” Schafer said. “You have to do it in a manner that is sustainable.” 
The fear that Williams and others are feeling has led to Hands Off!, a national day of action on Saturday. In North Dakota, some of the events are organized by a group called Indivisible. 
“This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies,” a description of the Fargo-area event planned for Saturday says. 
Other groups, including 50501, also are participating in events Saturday. Protests also are planned Saturday in Grand Forks, Bismarck, Jamestown and Minot. An event in Valley City was scheduled for Friday.

Rick Loftus, a doctor at the Veterans Administration hospital in Fargo, is the organizer of the Indivisible Fargo chapter, also known as Fearless. 
“Indivisible wants to focus on connecting citizens with their elected officials, holding electeds accountable to the people they represent,” Loftus said. 
He said the group is nonviolent and nonpartisan, with the Fargo chapter including Democrats, Republicans and independents, meeting every other Sunday.
“Everyone is respected. Everyone is welcome,” Loftus said. “We are explicitly pro-democracy, anti-fascism.” 
There is a partner chapter on the Minnesota side of the Red River — Red River United, that also is taking part in Saturday’s event. 




 North Dakota Hands Off! events Saturday

Fargo: 4 to 6 p.m., starting on the Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Red River on Main Avenue and moving to Woodlawn Park in Moorhead at about 5 p.m.
Grand Forks: 2:30 p.m. in the Town Square on DeMers Avenue, downtown.
Bismarck: 4 to 6 p.m. on the state Capitol grounds
Minot: 4 to 5 p.m., City Hall
Jamestown: Noon, Mill Hill




The Grand Forks area group formed in March, which as of Monday had more than 100 members, Williams said. That membership includes East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and other towns in northeast North Dakota, such as Grafton and Mayville. 
Williams said she is worried about the treatment of federal judges, how her former education colleagues from other countries may be treated and about cuts to the Social Security Administration by the Department of Government Efficiency. 
“If Elon Musk destroys the department, it’s not going to be able to issue checks with any kind of efficiency,” she said. 
Schafer, who was secretary of agriculture under President George W. Bush, said he is very familiar with how difficult it is to change the entrenched bureaucracy in Washington.  
“It needs to be done,” Schafer said.
He said Trump “just breaking down the doors” was perhaps the only way to get it started. 
Schafer said his experience is that the people in government best positioned to save money are those who work on the front lines of the programs. 
“Unless you can encourage or enlist the people who are out in the street delivering the programs, you’re not going to find a sustainable situation,” Schafer said. 
Nearly 67% of North Dakota voters supported Trump in the 2024 election, his strongest showing in the state in his three presidential campaigns. A North Dakota News Cooperative poll released in March showed a 52% approval rating for Trump’s policies. 
Sandi Sanford, chair of the North Dakota Republican Party, said in a statement that Trump is delivering on his campaign promises, “from securing our borders to revitalizing the economy.”
“As new policies take shape under his administration, we are confident that North Dakota — and
America — will continue to prosper,” Sanford said. 
House Bill 1442 in the Republican-dominated North Dakota Legislature seeks to create a state version of DOGE. 
While DOGE is trying to make federal employees accountable, Indivisible seeks to do the same with elected officials. 
Loftus said the Indivisible group promotes reaching out to elected officials through phone calls, letters and meetings with the official or their staff. 
“Sometimes holding a protest outside an office if they’re not willing to meet with us,” Loftus said. “It’s about getting messages to the elected about what people care about.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)  A federal judge chose not to stop the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) from examining how or if it will institute President Donald Trump’s January executive order forbidding federal subsidizing of “gender ideology” when it comes to awarding grants. 
But Senior District Judge William E. Smith agreed with the arts organizations suing the federal government on several points, including that the NEA will likely violate the First Amendment if it goes through with broad, ideological restrictions on the projects it funds. Still he said it was too early to intervene as the agency plans to announce how or if it will follow the order on April 30.
“This is the rare case where the balance of the harms and equities plus the public interest caution against the extraordinary relief requested,” Smith wrote in his 47-page decision released Thursday night.
The four groups that brought suit — Rhode Island Latino Arts, The Theater Offensive, National Queer Theater, and Theatre Communications Group — all intended to apply for grants for LGBTQ+ projects. The plaintiffs were represented by the national American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Rhode Island in the case filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
“The opinion makes clear that the NEA cannot lawfully reimpose its viewpoint-based eligibility bar,” Vera Eidelman, an ACLU senior staff attorney, said in a statement Thursday. “Though it falls short of the relief we were seeking, we are hopeful that artists of all views and backgrounds will remain eligible for the support and recognition they deserve.”
The plaintiffs sought to stop the NEA from applying Executive Order 14168 to its grantmaking procedures. In early March, the NEA had initially implemented the order by requiring grant applicants to check a box confirming that their work did not promote gender ideology — an impossibility, the plaintiffs argued, given their organizations’ showcasing of LGBTQ+ narratives and performers. There was also the possibility that LGBTQ+ content might fail to meet eligibility criteria under the new laws and be barred categorically.
But the NEA quickly removed the allegiance checkbox, and by March 17 had issued a memo stating it would cease rollout of the order for the time being. It also extended the application deadline for the current grant cycle. The agency expects to complete its internal review of the order by April 16 ahead of its public April 30 announcement.
That doesn’t help plaintiffs, who needed to apply for the grant cycle’s new deadline of Monday, April 7, to keep their production timelines intact.
“The court’s decision will leave our clients in a state of censorial limbo,” Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in a statement Thursday. 
Judge notes separation-of-powers concerns
Emilya Cachapero, co-executive director of national and global programming at Theatre Communications Group, was “disappointed” by the decision, she said in a statement, and pointed to wider implications: “This moment is about more than a single grant cycle — it’s about the future of artistic freedom in this country.”
According to court documents, Rhode Island Latino Arts and Theatre Communications Group testified that they were considering axing LGBTQ+ themes from upcoming productions to better secure grant funding — effectively self-censoring to avoid the executive order’s mandates. 
“We shouldn’t need to negotiate for the right to support and uplift all artists — including transgender and nonbinary artists,” Marta V. Martinez, executive director of Rhode Island Latino Arts, said in a statement. “This order fails to bring us the clarity we need to apply for funds for projects that allow Latinx artists, especially those who are queer, trans, or nonbinary, to show up as their whole selves without fear of erasure or censorship.”
In his ruling, Smith wrote that maneuvering to stop the NEA during its administrative process meant that granting relief would be premature — and it would not soothe much for the plaintiffs, as they no longer “faced a potential harm of civil, criminal, or administrative penalties for making false statements” since the compliance pledge has been removed from the application.

“If the Court enjoins the NEA from imposing an eligibility bar at this juncture, it will in effect short circuit the ongoing administrative review process set to conclude in a matter of days,” Smith wrote. 
That would not be ideal, the judge thought, as it “would rob the NEA of the opportunity to make its own considered decision.” The agency may conclude that the executive order is incompatible with the statute that authorizes its existence and duties, and may need congressional approval to take effect within the NEA.
“For the Court to intercede and mandate this outcome would raise obvious separation-of-powers concerns,” Smith wrote.
“Once the NEA completes its process, Plaintiffs may well return to the Court for relief — or, if the NEA declines to adopt the EO in any way, they may drop the curtain on this action altogether,” the judge concluded in his ruling.
Plaintiff Giselle Byrd, executive director of The Theater Offensive, said in a statement she was ready to wait for the NEA’s decision — and return to court if necessary: “Time is our greatest ally. … If this executive order is reimposed, we will be back in court and fighting against the unlawful attack on the First Amendment. We do not walk away silently against injustice and silence will not protect us.”
Not vague, but all too clear
Smith’s refusal of the plaintiffs’ request was not exactly a siding with the federal defendants — something his thorough decision makes clear, with arguments from the March 27 motion hearing explored in detail by the judge.   
The attorneys had sparred over whether NEA-funded projects constitute private speech — which is guarded by the First Amendment — or government speech, which lacks such protections. Smith conceded that the law is dense and nuanced in cases that define what speech is or isn’t. But he agreed with the ACLU that the NEA subsidizes private works, and is not a vehicle for official sentiments.
LGBTQ+ theater groups have day in court over endangered arts funding

“It seems clear that the NEA’s grantmaking process was designed to facilitate private speech, and not to promote a governmental message,” he wrote. “NEA-funded art is therefore protected under the First Amendment; and where, as here, the government has imposed a viewpoint-based condition on the receipt of those funds, there is a clear First Amendment violation.”
But Smith did agree with the U.S. Department of Justice’s argument that NEA grants are competitive.
​​“Plaintiffs must make choices that hopeful grant applicants make all the time about what to propose in their application, to enhance their chances of success. The Court cannot make the process free of difficult choices,” Smith wrote.
The NEA also eschewed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Smith agreed with the ACLU, when they initially adopted the executive order and created extra eligibility requirements for applicants. But he disagreed that the NEA was “arbitrary and capricious” in its carrying out of the order, as the ACLU had argued. 
The eligibility bar, Smith argued, is not problematic because of vagueness — it is problematic because it actively encourages the NEA to discriminate against certain kinds of applicants.
“If anything, the eligibility bar severely narrows the discretion of NEA personnel in deciding which projects to approve, and that is precisely why it likely violates both the APA and the First Amendment,” Smith wrote.

The Nurse Loan Repayment Program will provide up to $300,000 in tax-free funds to successful applicants to repay student debt for up to four years for those working at state psychiatric facilities or up to 10 years for individuals working at other eligible sites. There is about $9 million in funding available. 
Applicants will compete for two-year agreements from the program, and are  required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week for no less than 45 weeks per year at eligible nonprofit practice sites that provide nursing services. Full-time for nurses in public school settings or who teach at a school of nursing are also eligible.
“Nurses are the backbone of the health care system, providing essential care to patients in hospitals, clinics, schools and homes,” DHHS director Elizabeth Hertel said in a statement. “They are often the first point of contact for patients and play a critical role in patient education, advocacy and support. Health care facilities across the state are facing nursing shortages and this loan repayment program will help providers recruit and retain nurses to provide vital care to patients.”
According to the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration 74 of Michigan’s 83 counties are experiencing a shortage of primary care providers in at least part of the county. 
Nurses applying for the program must hold an active license as either a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse. 



Nurses looking to apply to the program must also:

Underly at a rally in February. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction is reviewing a request by the Trump administration that state education agencies ensure they aren’t using diversity, equity and inclusion programs — or risk losing federal funding. 
According to WisPolitics, state Superintendent Jill Underly said the agency is looking at the U.S. Department of Education’s “justification and authority to request sign off from Wisconsin schools on the federal agency’s political beliefs.” 
“Now more than ever, Wisconsin’s students, educators and schools need support – not threats of federal funding cuts that are vital to their success,” Underly said in a statement. “As we stated in February, we remain confident Wisconsin schools and the DPI are in full compliance with the law and remain committed to providing the best education possible for our students.”
In a letter, the Department of Education said that state agencies need to certify their compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the responsibilities outlined in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard — the landmark Supreme Court decision that said race-based programs in higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and effectively ended consideration of race in admissions programs. 
“Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement. “When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal antidiscrimination requirements. Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI.” 
The request comes as a part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing attack on DEI efforts across the country.
State agencies were given 10 days to collect certification from local education agencies and respond, according to the release. 
Underly, who was reelected to a second term this week, also urged state lawmakers Wednesday to invest in Wisconsin’s public schools amid the threat of funding cuts by the federal government.
“An unprecedented number of our school districts have been forced to turn to referenda, asking their communities to raise property taxes just to compensate for the state’s underfunding. On top of that, the Trump administration’s reckless cuts threaten the critical federal funding that Wisconsin schools depend on,” Underly said at a public hearing held by the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee in Kaukana. Underly was not invited for an agency briefing before the committee, so she traveled to deliver her message at the public hearing.
Her requests for state investment include increasing the state’s special education reimbursement for schools, funding universal free school meals and investing in mental health supports for students.

(Jim Still-Pepper | iStock via Getty Images)West Virginia officials say they’re reviewing the impacts of potential cuts to a federal program that helped thousands of state residents pay for heating and cooling last year. 
The Trump administration, through the Department of Government Efficiency, has reportedly cut the entire staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Last year, the program provided utility assistance or aid for repairs to approximately 50,000 households throughout the state.  
“The West Virginia Department of Human Services is aware of discussions regarding federal funding for the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP),” Angel Hightower, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services, wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch. “At this time, we are reviewing any potential impacts on the program and will provide updates as more information becomes available.”
LIEAP is the state’s version of the federal program.
In fiscal year 2024, LIHEAP provided assistance to 45,270 West Virginia households, according to the state. In addition, 3,235 West Virginia households got help from Emergency LIHEAP, another 846 homes got assistance for heating system repairs and replacements, and 586 homes got weatherization services through the program.
Nationally, the program provided 5.9 million households with a total of $6.2 billion in funding in 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The layoffs at LIHEAP were part of Health and Human Services’ larger reduction in force of 10,000 employees that officials say will save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year. 
The restructuring will “streamline” functions of the department, consolidating 28 divisions into 15, including a new “Administration for a Healthy America.” The department will prioritize ending chronic disease by focusing on “safe, wholesome food, clean water and the elimination of environmental toxins,” the department said. 
“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said in a statement. “This department will do more — a lot more — at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”
When asked about how the restructuring will affect LIHEAP, HHS press secretary Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano wrote in an email that “HHS will continue to comply with [statutory] requirements, and as a result of the reorganization, will be better positioned to execute on Congress’s statutory intent.” 
She did not respond to a followup question asking for clarification.

Scott Cupps strolled into a Missouri Capitol hearing room wearing a sports coat made of old quilts and toting a hand-cranked Bingo ball spinner.  The jacket was a gift from friends back in his Shell Knob district, commissioned by his grandmother’s old quilt club.

Scott Cupps, a Republican from Shell Knob, speaks March 3 in the Missouri House (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).State Rep. Scott Cupps strolled into a Missouri Capitol hearing room wearing a sports coat made of old quilts and toting a hand-cranked Bingo ball spinner. 
The jacket was a gift from friends back in his Shell Knob district, commissioned by his grandmother’s old quilt club. The Bingo spinner, procured from “the nuns at St. Mary’s Hospital” in Jefferson City, was how Cupps planned to decide which bills would take another step toward becoming law — and which would continue to languish. 
Cupps is chair of the House’s legislative rules committee, a gig that historically acts as equal parts rubber stamp and bottle neck for legislation. It receives bills after they’ve cleared another legislative committee, checks them for possible errors, then shuffles them along to the calendar of bills eligible for debate by the full chamber or sends them back to their original committee for changes. 
Some bills glide through. Others get hung up. The chair, usually in consultation with the speaker of the House that appointed them, gets to decide. 
And after being appointed chair of the committee this year by fellow Republican House Speaker Jon Patterson, Cupps — fulfilling a promise made to his friends by always showing up to hearings donning his quilted “rules chair jacket” — has made it abundantly clear he’s not interested in being a rubber stamp.
“If they wanted someone that was going to go through the charade of what a rules chair has been in the past, of rubber stamping my friends’ stuff and not communicating with the committee at all, that’s not me,” Cupps said. “That’s just not my personality.”
 State Rep. Scott Cupps choses which bills will be approved on Wednesday in the House legislative rules committee while wearing his “rules chair jacket” (photo submitted by Rep. Keri Ingle).
So Wednesday, upset that his committee has so far only been assigned one Senate bill, Cupps announced he would allow only five House bills to progress for every Senate bill his committee was assigned. 
And to ensure he couldn’t be accused of playing favorites, he let the Bingo balls decide. 
“We’re going to do things just a little bit different than we have in the past,” Cupps told the committee at the start of the hearing, adding: “And because there’s some bills on our agenda that I like and some I just absolutely hate, but I don’t hate the sponsor, I figure let’s just give everybody an equal, fair shot.”
Cupps gave one bill, which targeted nondisclosure agreements in childhood sexual abuse cases, the “free space,” to use Bingo jargon, because it has bipartisan support and is too important not to move along. 
Five others were then chosen at random using the ball spinner. 
His motivation, he said, is that at this point in the session, with only six weeks left before the legislature adjourns for the year, most House bills are never going to get through on their own. 
They’ll likely only succeed as amendments to Senate bills. So why spend time vetting a bunch of House bills unless the committee is also doing its due diligence on the Senate bills they’ll be attached to? 
“​​I want to be in a spot where my committee, not me, but my committee, gets to have input on some of those discussions,” he said, “and it’s hard to have input on those discussions if you don’t have some of the Senate bills that could eventually end up on the governor’s desk.”
The reaction, Cupps said, wasn’t terribly surprising. 
Lobbyists were incredulous. Lawmakers were furious. Cupps was accused of making a mockery of the legislative process. 
Cupps said he’s trying to prove a point.
“Yeah, there’s been some shenanigans,” he said, “but I am just trying to keep trash off the (debate) calendar and really focus on bills that mean something to my colleagues and their constituents, not some out–of-state lobby group. And focus on the bigger picture of how they fit into Senate bills that will ultimately be how they become law.”
Not everyone is convinced of Cupps’ noble goals, though. 
He originally wanted to be named vice chair of the powerful House budget committee, an appointment that would put him in line to be the committee’s chair in two years. 
But Patterson went with state Rep. Bishop Davidson instead. 
Getting passed over didn’t sit particularly well with Cupps, and his disappointment seemed to manifest into legislation. 
In February, he began to file bills that would rename every bridge in the state after Davidson; change the name of Taum Sauk Mountain to the “Bishop Davidson Summit”; change the name of the Katy Trail to the “Bishop Davidson Trail”; and change the name of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to the “Bishop Davidson Curriculum Distribution Department.”
So far, none of the bills have been assigned to a committee. 
“I’m just trying to get the guy the credit he deserves,” Cupps said, brushing off a question about whether he was acting out of frustration and noting that one of Davidson’s bills was among the five passed out of committee last week after being chosen using the Bingo ball spinner. 
“Proof that we’re just trying to be fair,” he said. 
State Rep. Keri Ingle, a Lee’s Summit Democrat who has served on the rules committee for seven years, said in an interview the day after the Bingo hearing that “it’s infrequent that I see something in this building that surprises me. And yesterday was rather surprising.”
There appears to be, Ingle said, “a lot of internal conflict within the Republican conference, specifically around some of the chairs of the committees, and I think that that is now spilling out into public.”
But the intent of the rules committee, Ingle said, seems to have always been to either slow down bad legislation or allow further negotiations. By that standard, Cupps’ “crazy displays” are unusual, but the outcome isn’t. 
“I remember my first two years when the rules chairs, Holly Rehder and Rocky Miller, ran rules in a very specific way and held Senate bills and House bills until the (prescription drug monitoring bill) was heard in the Senate,” she said. “And so I know that, historically, it has been used in such a way.”
And the committee has taken action on lots of bills this year, Ingle notes. According to the House website, Cupps’ committee has passed 103 of the 143 bills it has been assigned so far this year.

For his part, Cupps said the Bingo-ball method was not intended to be disrespectful. He considers Patterson a close friend and believes the speaker knew what kind of chairman he would be when he appointed him. 
“I sure am not going to speak for the speaker, because I do consider him a friend,” Cupps said. “But I will tell you, I believe that he knows me well enough that appointing me meant he wanted someone who was going to use the rules committee as a way to actually vet not only individual pieces of legislation, but what the legislation it actually potentially could turn into.”
Patterson may not have known “exactly what he was getting into,” Cupps said with a laugh,”but I don’t think he’s shocked and flabbergasted.”
Through a spokesman, Patterson declined comment. 
The rules committee is scheduled to meet again Monday. 
Unless the flooding in his district keeps him from making the trip , Cupps will be there with his “rules chair jacket” and Bingo ball spinner. He’ll convene the hearing using a gavel he’s dubbed “liberado” — another gift from longtime family friends, adorned with shotgun shells and rifle cartridge casings from his great-grandfather’s general store and held together by a cultivator shank that used to belong to his dad. 
The committee was assigned another Senate bill on Thursday, so five more House bills may very well continue on in the process. 
“We have the best committee in the House,” Cupps said. “It might sound like I am saying that in jest, but I really believe that. We communicate well together. We have people from very diverse backgrounds with knowledge in different areas. So when we’re talking about actual legislation that we might turn into law in the state of Missouri, hey, let’s allow us to be part of that conversation.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The state of Florida may enforce a law eliminating general education courses that teach “identity politics” at Florida’s institutions of higher education pending resolution of a lawsuit filed by professors, a federal judge has ruled.
In January, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida filed suit on the professors’ behalf alleging that SB 266, a 2023 law limiting general education course classifications and funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, harmed the professors’ academic ambitions. General education courses are required for students to graduate. 
Days after a preliminary injunction hearing in Tallahassee in front of U.S. District Chief Judge Mark Walker, he ruled Wednesday that the professors had not established theywould suffer any harm.
‘Viewpoint-discriminatory’ higher education law heard for preliminary injunction

“This ruling is disappointing, but also offers a clearer path forward to prove this law is unconstitutional,” said Bacardi Jackson, executive director of the ACLU of Florida in a news release. “The law is a blatant effort to control the content of higher education, muzzle Florida’s scholars, and erase perspectives the state finds politically inconvenient. We remain committed to fighting alongside faculty, students, and the broader academic community until this undemocratic law is struck down.”
Among the plaintiffs is University of Florida political science professor Sharon Austin, who complains she was denied funding to present at a 2024 conference hosted by Diversity Abroad, which the school had paid for her to present at in 2023. The school specifically cited SB 266 in refusing to pay for her to appear subsequently, the suit alleges.
“As for Plaintiff Austin, her declaration demonstrates that she has already suffered a denial of state funding to attend conferences in 2024. However, to obtain prospective relief, she must demonstrate an unambiguous intention to seek funding to attend conferences at a reasonably foreseeable time in the future. That she has not done,” Walker wrote. 
Professors who have had their courses removed from general education requirements, or fear it may happen, say their injury is chilled speech and potential repercussions in post-tenure review. 
“To the extent these Plaintiffs claim their classroom speech associated with courses for which they have no stated plans to teach at a reasonably foreseeable time in the future will be chilled, such a hypothetical future chill is both too remote and speculative to amount to a cognizable injury in fact,” Walker wrote. 
ACLU will continue
The plaintiffs allege viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment; that the law is over-broad; and that it violates Florida’s Campus Free Expression Act.
State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues said in January that the law has helped address a Gallup poll that found “political agendas” as Americans’ Number One reason they have lost confidence in higher education.
Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. said the law helps students who can be “overwhelmed by the number of courses that are out there,” and that students can take whatever classes they wish, “but the easier we can make it for them when it comes to general education and making sure that they’re getting what they need there I think is very important.”
Walker did not rule on merits of the underlying case and the ACLU said it will continue its challenge. 
“Plaintiffs’ evidence does not demonstrate that any Plaintiff faces an imminent injury — namely, chilled speech — that is traceable to any Defendant’s enforcement of the general education requirements,” Walker wrote. 
“For what it’s worth, Plaintiffs’ existential concerns about the survival of their academic departments and the future viability of their areas of expertise in the state of Florida are certainly understandable. However, these concerns, as described at length in Plaintiffs’ declarations, do not give rise to a concrete, imminent, and non-speculative injury in fact sufficient to permit Plaintiffs to seek a preliminary injunction against Defendants’ enforcement of the general education requirements.”

Included in the massive federal workforce cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services this week was the elimination of an office that runs a program over 100,000 Missouri families rely on to help pay their heating and cooling bills. 
The layoffs within the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides Congressionally-approved funds that are administered by Missouri’s social services department, leaves the program’s future in limbo. 
LIHEAP is designed to help those with few resources cover their home energy bills in the summer and winter. Since October, the program has helped offset utility costs for 100,839 households, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Social Services.
The state received over $136.4 million for the program in fiscal year 2023, and the average benefit for the heating and cooling program was around $675 per household.
The Department of Social Services has “not received any official updates regarding potential program reductions,” said spokesperson Baylee Watts, and the federal government hasn’t announced program cuts. But advocates fear that without the federal staff, the future allocation of funding is uncertain. 
“Any cuts to LIHEAP will be detrimental to Missourians who are already struggling to keep up with increasing electric and gas bills,” said Sandra Padgett, executive director of Consumers Council of Missouri, in a press release. 
States are still waiting for around 10% of their annual funding allocation for the federal fiscal year that began in October. That amount usually arrives in June. Watts said Missouri hasn’t been notified yet of what that amount is, but it was $8.1 million last year. 
Those funds aren’t expected to be needed until the fiscal year that starts in October, though, Watts said, based on the way Missouri has allocated funding.
“At this moment, DSS does not anticipate any impact on services,” Watts said.
At the same time, a bill adding a charge onto utility bills passed the state legislature and is awaiting the governor’s signature.

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, filed bipartisan legislation to deliver as much as $50 million in federal transportation infrastructure grant funding to cities hosting 2026 World Cup events and Olympic competition in 2028 and 2034. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas reintroduced federal legislation to set aside $50 million annually for transportation infrastructure projects in support of cities hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, 2028 Summer Olympic Games and 2034 Winter Olympic Games.
Moran’s primary interest was a section of the bill earmarking funding to 11 U.S. cities, including Kansas City, selected to host Men’s World Cup competition next year.
“It was a tremendous feat to secure a spot as a host city during the 2026 World Cup, and I have no doubt that Kansas City will be a welcoming community for hundreds of thousands of soccer fans from around the world,” the Republican senator said. “Preparations are already underway for the games and this legislation will support local community and agency efforts to improve infrastructure to connect fans with businesses, hotels, the airport and other host cities during the World Cup.”
Other cities hosting World Cup competition are Seattle, Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and New Jersey, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay area.
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and a member with Moran on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said the proposed federal funding would help communities safely and efficiently coordinate transportation for fans, workers and goods during World Cup and Olympic events.
“With less than 500 days until Seattle hosts its first 2026 World Cup game, we need the Department of Transportation to get in the game and support host cities as they work to showcase the best of American innovation and hospitality,” she said.
Under the Senate bill, host cities and surrounding communities would be eligible for grants to build roads, expand light rail, purchase buses, create bicycle lanes, improve existing roads and upgrade airport terminals for the World Cup as well as the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles and the 2034 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Text of the bill indicated funding also could be used for Paralympics, Special Olympics and women’s World Cup events.
Financial aid funneled through the U.S. transportation agency could be spread among host cities, states and tribes within 100 miles of the sports venues, the bill said.
“We are pleased to see this important transportation assistance legislation introduced in support of Kansas City’s World Cup efforts,” said Pam Kramer, chief executive officer of KC2026. “These investments and support will help us create sustained and lasting impact beyond the World Cup, improving mobility in the region well beyond 2026.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Moran-on-USAID-1-1024x524.png,,,2025-04-04 14:10:37.158120

(Photo by Alex Goodlett for Utah News Dispatch)Perhaps the most eloquent summation of America in the age of Donald Trump comes from the famous quote of eighteenth-century French Enlightenment philosopher and acerbic social critic François-Marie Arouet, known by his pen name as Voltaire. He wrote, “Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.”
Trump has been dragging this country into a land littered with “absurdities” and non-reality since he rode down the escalator in 2015.  Now in his second term, teamed up with apex predator and wolf in DOGE clothing, Elon Musk, those absurdities are in full bloom as authoritarian, Nazi-saluting moral atrocities.
Public protests have sprung up throughout the country on almost every move Trump and Musk have made. One of the most important protest movements, but least publicized, is “Stand Up for Science.” I attended the rally in Salt Lake City on March 8 along with hundreds of other Utahns. But next time the attendance should be hundreds of thousands.
Two weeks ago, new director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, announced that EPA’s mission would be flipped on its head, i.e. it would no longer be to protect human life, public health and our air, water, and environment from contamination, but to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.” Even from an economic standpoint this is an absurdity.
On average the economic benefits to EPA regulations established through the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act have been about 30 times the cost to industry of complying with those regulations.  Even the narrowest of interpretations of that equation finds a 3-to-1 benefit ratio. It is primarily thanks to EPA regulations on smoke stack and tail pipe emissions that Utah’s particulate pollution (PM2.5) has generally improved in the last 20 years (although that improvement is being eroded by more wildfire pollution).  A recent study from Utah scientists estimated that up to 8,000 Utahns die, and economic losses are up to $3.3 billion a year, due to current levels of pollution.
Voltaire would have cringed at Zeldin boasting the EPA will do its part to “power the great American comeback.” Comeback to what? More dead and sick Utahns and more economic losses?  Even if you assign no economic value to your own health, quality of life, or life expectancy, fossil fuel generated energy is now more expensive than clean energy.
On the EPA’s official website, Zeldin boasts, “We are driving a dagger through the heart of the climate change religion.” A MAGA cultist slandering the most important scientific reality in human history as a “religion” is right from the authoritarian play book: accuse your opposition of the very atrocities you’re committing.
Over 99.9% of climate research dating back to 1807, has confirmed an accelerating climate crisis from increasing atmospheric CO2.  It’s been declared the greatest public health threat of the 21st century by the world’s top 200 medical journals. Even the oil industry’s scientists identified looming catastrophic global warming with “shocking skill and accuracy” as early the 1970s.  As we all know, the industry betrayed their own science, deciding that saving humanity would not interfere with quarterly profits.
That Musk promotes himself as a scientific genius while spearing heading some of the most anti-science delusions infecting the Trump Administration is particularly galling. Trump’s entire cabinet, their party’s Congressional majorities, and even some Democrats have for years personified the scientific absurdity and moral atrocity warned about by Voltaire.
For their part, our legislature keeps telling themselves that Utah is the best managed state in the nation. The 25,000-80,000 Utahns that died in the last decade from our air pollution might think otherwise. Our legislature is also disconnected from the wishes of their undead constituency, with their ongoing determination to wrest control of public lands away from the federal government, and to immunize Utah against mythical “federal regulatory overreach.” 
A Colorado College annual poll found that 76% of Utahns want their leaders “to place more emphasis on protecting water, air, wildlife habitat, and recreation opportunities over maximizing the amount of land available for drilling and mining.” Fifty-seven percent “oppose giving state government control over national public lands,” such as forests, monuments, and wildlife refuges. Nearly two thirds support government action “to reduce carbon pollution that contributes to climate change.” Yet our leaders persist in doing the opposite.
For example, Utah has spent your tax dollars fighting the “Good Neighbor Rule” which would have required reducing pollution from our coal power plants that send death and disease over to Colorado, as if those lives mean nothing. How does anyone square that moral failure with the Parable of the Good Samaritan whose virtue so many of our legislators hear extolled in their church services?

Yet another delay emerged Friday as defendant David Lee Chaney, 45, requested that the judge in charge of the case recuse, said an attorney who attended a closed-door meeting where the request was made. Fellow co-founder Benjamin Scott Harris, 49, kept the case in limbo for much of the past year while pursuing the same tactic.
Harris and Chaney were charged in 2022 with racketeering and a litany of financial crimes. Prosecutors alleged the co-founders engineered a complex scheme to enrich themselves with millions of taxpayer dollars intended for Epic students.
The co-founders, who started Epic in 2011, deny that any of their business practices were illegal. Their attorneys said Harris and Chaney were successful businessmen following the advice of their legal counsel while their virtual charter school rapidly grew into the largest public school system in the state during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Epic cut all ties with the co-founders in 2021. The school educates nearly 31,000 students across Oklahoma, about half as many as it did during its peak enrollment in 2020.
Prosecutors from the Attorney General’s Office began laying out their case against Harris and Chaney in a preliminary hearing in March 2024. A judge would decide after the hearing concludes whether the state has collected enough evidence for the case to continue to trial.
A week wasn’t enough time for attorneys on both sides of the case to question witnesses and discuss evidence. Similarly, a year hasn’t been enough to resolve various conflicts that have blocked the hearing from proceeding.

On the day the preliminary hearing was meant to resume in May, attorneys representing the case’s star witness and co-defendant, former Epic CFO Joshua Aaron Brock, filed a request for Chaney’s lawyer to recuse.
Brock, 43, contended that Chaney’s attorney, Gary Wood, used to represent him, too. It would be unethical for Wood to cross-examine a former client, his filing stated.
Wood denied ever representing Brock.
Before the matter of Wood’s disqualification was resolved, an attorney representing Harris called for the judge in charge of the case to recuse last year. Defense attorney Joe White accused district Judge Susan Stallings of having bias in favor of the prosecution.
Stallings would preside over the co-founders’ trial, if the case ever gets that far, and she is tasked with deciding whether Wood should be disqualified.

Stallings refused to step down from the case, and White appealed the decision three times. 
His string of appeals came to an end in February when the Oklahoma Supreme Court declined to hear his arguments, instead opting to uphold lower court decisions that favored keeping Stallings on the case.
Now, Chaney has asked Stallings to recuse. His attorney, Wood, made the request in a confidential meeting with the judge on Friday. 
Afterward, Wood declined to comment on any matters discussed in the closed courtroom. The Attorney General’s Office also declined to comment.
Another attorney present in the meeting, Chris Box, who represents Brock, confirmed Wood asked Stallings to disqualify herself because a lawyer from the Attorney General’s Office represented her in the prior recusal appeals. Box said the judge will hear the disqualification request again in a public hearing at 2:30 p.m. May 2.

If the past year is any indication, it could take several months to resolve the dispute.
Attorneys requesting that a judge step down first do so in private, like what happened Friday. If the judge declines, the attorney could repeat the request in a public court hearing. 
If denied again, the attorney could appeal to the county’s chief district judge, a role the district judges accept on a rotating basis. Then, the matter could be elevated to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and finally the state Supreme Court.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Wanted: investors to back $165 million for the sale of two Rhode Island hospitals with a troubled past and uncertain future, according to one major credit rating agency.
Sound appealing? 
Members of the state’s quasi-public financing agency hope so, noting that the borrowing is crucial to close the deal selling Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital to new, nonprofit owners. The Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp. authorized the sale of up to $165 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds by a 4-1 vote Thursday.
Rescuing the pair of urban safety net hospitals from owner Prospect Medical Holdings has been a complicated and long-winding journey, even before Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. The Centurion Foundation, an Atlanta-based nonprofit, emerged as the only interested and “viable” candidate two years ago. Its $80 million offer, backed by debt financing, with no direct equity investment of its own, raised alarm among hospital union workers.
But state regulators with the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General and the Rhode Island Department of Heath ultimately signed off in June 2024, attaching a list of 85 conditions meant to protect hospital operations, workers and patients even if the new owner runs into financial trouble. Conditions included a separate $80 million capital injection — on top of the $80 million sale price — for the hospitals’ balance sheet, along with a separate, $66.8 million escrow fund that cannot be used for executive compensation or management fees. 
But S&P Global Ratings Agency was unconvinced by the credit stability of the CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, the new Rhode Island subsidiary formed by Centurion. The credit ratings agency gave the bonds a BB- rating, which denotes a relatively high risk for a non-investment grade bond. S&P analysts in a corresponding March 25 report noted the “significant uncertainty” surrounding future financial, strategic and operating performance, anticipating a 33% chance of a rating downgrade within a year.
Meanwhile, Acacia Financial Group, a consultant for the quasi-public state financing agency, was unable to draw conclusions about the stability of the new CharterCARE subsidiary nor independently verify projections submitted by a separate consultant, VMG Health, according to the report submitted to the board, and obtained by Rhode Island Current.
Current owner Prospect’s Rhode Island subsidiary ended fiscal year 2023 with a $60 million loss for its Rhode Island hospitals and related physician groups, according to audited statements. VMG Health in a February 2025 feasibility study projected operating losses would continue for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, but that the new owners would be back in the black by fiscal 2026 by more than $5 million, according to the report given to the board.
The alternative does not exist
Board members weighed the financial risk of the borrowing against the alternative: not issuing the bonds could jeopardize the sale, and in turn, the future of the hospitals.
“I know this is a difficult decision, but there is no alternative,” Jeffrey Liebman, CharterCARE CEO, said during the meeting. “I have watched other hospitals close, here, in Massachusetts and across the country. I don’t want you to think there is a long timeline here for these hospitals to survive if you don’t take this vote.”
The two hospitals, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
Lisa Andoscia, the only board member who voted against the bond sale, said it was “too risky.”
“Rhode Island needs to be resilient and deserves an experienced operator for Fatima and Roger Williams hospitals,” Andoscia said in an interview Friday. “They deserve an owner who brings financial stability and operational preparedness to make these essential hospitals financially viable in the future.”
Andoscia added, “I think it’s just a short-term stop to the hemorrhaging.”
Municipal leaders in Providence and North Providence, which host the pair of hospitals, are also not happy. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley, North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi and the North Providence Town Council expressed concern in separate letters about financial losses when the sale goes through. Standing agreements between the municipalities and Prospect provide lump sum payments to the host communities instead of regular property taxes; without new, or continued agreements, the communities stand to lose a combined $8.5 million in fiscal 2026, Smiley and Lombardi wrote in a joint letter on Nov. 1, 2024.
“These unsustainable losses will lead to devastating cuts to our annual operating budgets,” Smiley and Lombardi wrote.
Smiley and Lombardi asked the board to require as part of its financing approval that the new owners honor the existing payment plans until they negotiate new ones with municipal leaders. But that’s outside the board’s purview, Dylan Zelazo, executive director, said in a written reply to Smiley and Lombardi on March 21.
Liebman said during the meeting that Centurion was willing to work with municipal leaders to set up new payment agreements. 
The pair of taxable and tax-exempt bonds are backed by mortgages on the hospitals and any revenue derived from their operations. The approved financing agreement also requires the borrowers to keep a reserve fund equal to 110% of annual debt service, and a minimum cash flow to cover 40 days of payments.
In addition to the pair of taxable and tax-exempt bonds, the new owners are also assuming the $43 million balance on a low-interest PACE loan Prospect took out in 2021, as well as its leases. 
Together, the new and existing debt payments require the new owners to spend $404 million paying off principal and interest through 2055, according to a projected payment schedule by Acacia Financial Group. The highest single-year debt payment comes in 2035, when the $67.5 million in taxable bond matures, requiring nearly $60 million in principal and interest payments on that bond alone.
The proposed timeline included in the report anticipates the sale will close on April 30, providing bankers can find investors to purchase the bonds.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE, expressed gratitude for the board’s approval to authorize the bond financing.
We now look forward to securing funding to support our acquisition of these two critical hospitals and the preservation of 2,700 jobs and dedicated employees,” Brown said in an emailed response Thursday.
He did not respond to follow up questions regarding concern over credit and financial stability of the new ownership.

,DC,2025-04-04 16:54:24+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,'Really scared': Parents of kids with disabilities confront Education Department chaos,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/really-scared-parents-kids-disabilities-confront-education-department-chaos,,"WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump takes drastic steps to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, disability advocates are worried about whether the agency can carry out its responsibilities to serve students with disabilities.Representatives of several disability advocacy groups cited “chaos,” “fear” and “uncertainty” in describing the situation to States Newsroom. They said there’s a lack of clarity about both proposed changes within the realm of special education services and the impact overall of sweeping shifts at the agency, calling into question whether the department can deliver on its congressionally mandated guarantees for students with disabilities.“It’s only been a few weeks since these things started happening, so I don’t think we’re seeing any of the effects trickle down right now, but we do have parents reaching out to us, calling and feeling really scared,” said Robyn Linscott, director of education and family policy at The Arc of the United States, an advocacy group for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.Among the department’s chief responsibilities is guaranteeing a free public education for students with disabilities through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, and enforcing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, part of which bars programs and activities receiving federal funding from discrimination on the basis of disability.The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was enacted in 1975 under a different title and later renamed in 1990.IDEA “governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education, and related services” to students with disabilities, per the department.The department notes that before the 1975 law, “many children were denied access to education and opportunities to learn” and in 1970, “U.S. schools educated only one in five children with disabilities.” According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 15% of all public school students in the country received services through IDEA during the 2022-2023 school year.In fiscal year 2024, $15.4 billion was appropriated for IDEA.Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that: “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.Closing the departmentTrump signed an executive order in March that called on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the agency to the maximum extent she’s permitted to by law.The department also announced earlier that month that it would be slashing more than 1,300 positions through a “reduction in force,” or RIF effort, sparking widespread concerns about how the department could deliver on its core functions.

For special education services, advocates question significant cuts to units like the Office for Civil Rights, which is tasked with investigating discrimination complaints, including those that are disability-based.Linscott said parents are asking questions such as: “‘What does this mean? Is my child still going to be able to have an (Individualized Education Program)? Is the state going to be required to uphold the IDEA? Or, I have a pending complaint with (the Office for Civil Rights), what does this mean for how long it’s going to take to settle this case or to investigate this claim?’”Heather Eckner, director of statewide education at the Autism Alliance of Michigan, said it’s been “all-consuming” trying to keep up with what she calls a “chaos factory,” noting that it’s a lot of work for advocacy groups and policy analysts “to try to sort through and figure out what’s real, what’s actually happening, what might happen, and where the impact might be.”“Ultimately, this is just having a significant destabilizing effect,” said Eckner, whose statewide organization focuses on expanding opportunities for people with autism.Moving special education services to HHSThat uncertainty also stems from Trump’s announcement in March that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services “will be handling special needs.”The proposal sparked concern and confusion among disability advocates, both for what that transfer would look like and the legality of the proposed move. The president offered little detail into the proposal, but HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on social media that the agency is “fully prepared” to take on that responsibility.Meanwhile, HHS is witnessing its own drastic changes and restructuring, including beginning to lay off 10,000 workers — further calling into question how that agency could take on the Education Department’s special education services.In response to a request for comment, HHS directed States Newsroom to Kennedy’s social media post regarding the proposed transfer but did not provide any further details.“We have a lot of concerns over both the legality of that, but also just what that means for kind of how we view the education of students with disabilities in general, and how do we view disability in this country, and then what those actual implications on students are,” Linscott said. Jennifer Coco, interim executive director at the Center for Learner Equity, told States Newsroom that any move to separate the education of students with disabilities from the education of all students “further pathologizes disability and is treating 15% of all the children in our public school buildings like they’re medical issues — they’re not.”“They are students who learn differently, a vast majority of whom could learn at the same grade level as their peers if they were provided appropriate instruction,” said Coco, whose national nonprofit focuses on ensuring students with disabilities have access to quality educational opportunities, including public school choice.Any transfer of responsibility for these federal laws, such as IDEA, would require an act of Congress — a significant undertaking given that at least 60 votes are needed to break through the Senate’s filibuster and Republicans, with their narrow majority, hold just 53 seats.The Education Department told States Newsroom that no action has been taken to move federally mandated programs out of the agency at this time.“As President Trump and Secretary McMahon have made clear, sunsetting the Department of Education will be done in partnership with Congress and national and state leaders to ensure all statutorily required programs are managed responsibly and where they best serve students and families,” Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-04 13:09:27.900307

To receive public assistance in Idaho, state agencies are largely required to verify the lawful presence of adults applying for benefits. But Idaho law spells out exceptions for certain services, including emergency health care, immunization, communicable disease testing and treatment, prenatal and postnatal care, and food assistance for dependent children.
House Bill 135 removes some of those exceptions — requiring state agencies to verify someone’s immigration status for those services.
Under the bill, some emergency services remain exempt from the immigration status verification requirement. 
The new law takes effect July 1. 
Democrats cast the bill as cruel. 
“Have we as a society lost all respect for decency? I haven’t been able to answer that one yet. I think that question remains to be answered. The second question I asked myself was, ‘What would Jesus do?’” Sen. Ron Taylor, D-Hailey told the Idaho Senate. “I answered that question. I’ll be voting no.”
Little signed the bill into law Wednesday, according to the governor’s office legislation tracker. The Senate passed the bill on a 26-9 vote this week. The House already passed the bill on a 46-22 vote.

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive [&#8230;]","A monument to the former slaves and Union Army soldiers who raised money to found Lincoln University greets visitors to the historically Black college and university located in Jefferson City (Photo courtesy of Lincoln University).The nation’s historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, are wondering how to survive in an uncertain and contentious educational climate as the Trump administration downsizes the scope and purpose of the U.S. Department of Education — while cutting away at federal funding for higher education.
In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.
Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
 ‘None of them are equitable’

In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”
Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
 Economic anchors

There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.
Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”
For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program.

A federal judge has ordered the staff restated, but the federal government is appealing the decision.","The Science and Technology building  on the campus of Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in New Mexico, one of the tribal schools that lost federal funding. (Photographer
Dennis Dye/courtesy USGS)After weeks of uncertainty, two tribal colleges have been told they can hire back all employees who were laid off as part of the Trump administration’s deep cuts across the federal workforce in February, part of a judge’s order restoring some federal employees whose positions were terminated.
Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, widely known as SIPI, in New Mexico lost about 70 employees in mid-February amid widespread staffing cuts to federal agencies. While most of the nation’s 37 tribal colleges and universities are chartered by American Indian tribes, Haskell and SIPI are not associated with individual tribes and are run by the federal government.

This story about tribal colleges was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

About 55 employees were laid off and 15 accepted offers to resign, according to a lawsuit filed last month by tribes and students. The colleges were forced to cancel or reconfigure a wide range of services, from sports and food service to financial aid and classes. In some cases, instructors were hired by other universities as adjuncts and then sent back to the tribal colleges to keep teaching.
It was not clear this week when and if the workers would return, whether the employees who resigned would also be offered their jobs back, or if the government would allow colleges to fill vacancies. Both colleges said some employees had turned down the offers.
The Bureau of Indian Education, which runs the colleges, declined to answer questions except to confirm the laid-off workers would be offered jobs with back pay to comply with a judge’s order that the government reverse course on thousands of layoffs of probationary employees. But the agency also noted the jobs would be available “as the White House pursues its appeals process,” indicating possible turmoil if an appeals court reinstates the layoffs.
Both colleges said the bureau also has refused to answer most of their questions.
SIPI leaders were told last week that the positions were being restored, said Adam Begaye, chairman of the SIPI Board of Regents. The 270-student college lost 21 employees, he said, four of whom decided to take early retirement. All but one of the remaining 17 agreed to return, Begaye said.
The chaos has been difficult for those employees, he said, and the college is providing counseling.
“We want to make sure they have an easy adjustment, no matter what they’ve endured,” Begaye said.
The chairman of Haskell’s Board of Regents, Dalton Henry, said he was unsure how many of the 50 lost employees were returning. Like SIPI, Haskell was forced after the layoffs to shift job responsibilities and increase the workload for instructors and others.
Haskell was reviewed by accreditors in December, and Henry said he was worried how the turmoil would affect the process. Colleges and universities must be accredited to offer federal and state financial aid and participate in most other publicly funded programs. 
Henry declined to discuss his thoughts on the chaos, saying there was nothing the college could do about it.
“Whatever guidance is provided, that’s what we have to adhere to,” he said. “It’s a concern. But at this point, it’s the federal government’s decision.”
The Bureau of Indian Affairs declined to make the presidents of the two colleges available for interviews. 
Tribal colleges and universities were established to comply with treaties and the federal trust responsibility, legally binding agreements in which the United States promised to fund Indigenous education and other needs. But college leaders argue the country has violated those contracts by consistently failing to fund the schools adequately.
In the federal lawsuit claiming the Haskell and SIPI cuts were illegal, students and tribes argued the Bureau of Indian Education has long understaffed the colleges. The agency’s “well-documented and persistent inadequacies in operating its schools range from fiscal mismanagement to failure to provide adequate education to inhospitable buildings,” plaintiffs claimed.
Sen. Jerry Moran and Rep. Tracey Mann, both Kansas Republicans, said before Trump took office that they plan to introduce a bill shifting Haskell from federal control to a congressional charter, which would protect the university from cuts across federal agencies such as the Bureau of Indian Education. 
“[F]or the last few years the university has been neglected and mismanaged by the Bureau of Indian Education,” Moran said in a written statement in December. “The bureau has failed to protect students, respond to my congressional inquiries or meet the basic infrastructure needs of the school.”
The February cuts brought rare public visibility to tribal colleges, most of which are in remote locations. Trump’s executive orders spurred outrage from Indigenous communities and a flurry of national news attention.
“We’re using this chaos as a blessing in disguise to make sure our family and friends in the community know what SIPI provides,” said Begaye, the SIPI board president.
The uncertainty surrounding the colleges’ funding has left a lasting mark, said Ahniwake Rose, president and CEO of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, which advocates for tribal colleges. But she added she was proud of how the schools have weathered the cuts.
“Indian country is always one of the most resourceful and creative populations,” she said. “We’ve always made do with less. I think you saw resilience and creativity from Haskell and SIPI.”

Ed Setzler pitches his RFRA bill at an April 1 press conference. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp kicked off the final day of the 2025 legislative session by signing Senate Bill 36, also known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), into law, appeasing some Georgian residents who have been calling for stronger protections under state law for free exercise of religion. 
The bill mirrors federal legislation that has been in place since 1993, and imposes new restrictions on state and local governments’ ability to “substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” unless it is “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.” It gained final passage out of the House on April 2 in a 96-70 vote that fell largely along party lines.
Democrats in particular have opposed the bill, arguing that without statewide civil rights protections, a RFRA law would allow Georgians greater leeway to discriminate against LGBTQ people and religious minorities.
Establishing new religious protections under state law has been a goal of the Georgia GOP since shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. The bill’s sponsor, Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler, first introduced the legislation nearly a decade ago during the 2016 legislative session. The same year, a similar religious freedom bill passed out of the Georgia Legislature, but was ultimately vetoed by then-Governor Nathan Deal, who said he wanted to keep Georgia “a welcoming state.”
Prior to Deal’s veto, some of Georgia’s largest employers, including Coca Cola and Delta Air Lines, warned that the RFRA bill that the Legislature passed would create a law that made recruiting essential workers more difficult.
In a speech immediately after signing the bill, Kemp downplayed concerns that the bill could increase discrimination, drawing parallels between RFRA and legislation from previous sessions aimed at combating hate crimes in the wake of Ahmaud Arbery’s murder and heightening statewide protections against antisemitism.
“Today I signed SB 36, also known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, ensuring that once again at the state level, that Georgians are protected, including Georgians of faith,” he said. “I wanted to let everybody know that despite signing that legislation, Georgia still remains a state that has no place for hate, and I can assure all Georgians of that today.”

If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?” (Getty Images)When the government puts legal barriers in place to strip away or prevent health care access, it’s not just politics — it’s real people’s lives at stake.
During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House. This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their job will be affected if the laws would drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.” But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk. Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients. Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools around the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn.
Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried. When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people. Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.

(Photo illustration by Namthip Muanthongthae / Getty Images)The U.S. government announced last week that two confidential informants and an FBI special agent based in New Mexico’s largest city discovered and seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in virtual currency that officials say was meant for Hamas.
On March 25, a special agent with the Albuquerque field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation asked a federal court in Washington D.C. for permission to seize the virtual currencies. U.S. Magistrate Judge Matthew J. Sharbaugh signed the application.
According to the agent’s sworn statement attached to the application, in February, FBI Albuquerque “identified a terrorist financing network soliciting donations to the al-Qassam Brigades,” Hamas’ military wing. The U.S. has designated Hamas a terrorist organization.
The FBI agent wrote in the warrant application that he believes the funds are “traceable to, and involved in, a scheme to solicit donations of virtual currency to” Hamas, and to launder those donations on the group’s behalf.
The warrant and associated documents indicate they were filed in the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available. Source NM searched online federal court records for the case number associated with the warrant but could not find anything.
But the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia attached the records to a March 27 news release in which the government said it disrupted “an ongoing terrorist financing scheme” by seizing approximately $201,400 worth of virtual currency held in wallets and accounts intended to benefit Hamas.
It is unusual for federal prosecutors to publish an otherwise sealed search warrant before actually charging someone with a crime, two sources with knowledge of the federal criminal legal system who asked to remain anonymous told Source NM.
A case usually doesn’t get opened until after someone is formally presented with the charges against them in court, the sources said.
One of the sources suggested that the reason why the DOJ is publicly talking about the case before any charges is that Ed Martin, President Donald Trump’s appointed interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Washington D.C., is “trying to make political hay out of an otherwise normal investigation, in an incredibly irregular way.”
Adam Schiff, a Democratic U.S. senator from California, on Tuesday placed a hold on Martin’s permanent confirmation as D.C.’s top federal prosecutor, alleging Martin had “abused” his role.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia did not return an email seeking comment on the case.
The seized funds were traced from fundraising addresses allegedly controlled by Hamas that were used to launder more than $1.5 million in virtual currency since October 2024, the DOJ said.
FBI Albuquerque is investigating the case alongside the FBI Counterterrorism Division and Cyber Division, according to the news release.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While the FBI agent’s affidavit only reveals some of what the U.S. government knows about the investigation, it appears to show that the agent’s involvement began when an FBI confidential informant in the U.S. on Feb. 6 alerted them to a post on the instant messenger service Telegram asking supporters to contact an email address allegedly associated with al-Qassam in order to donate. Four days later, the informant sent a message to the email address and received a response a few hours later containing instructions on how to donate, according to the translation included in the warrant.
Another informant on Feb. 17 alerted the agent to seven more places to donate virtual currency that the informant allegedly received by emailing al-Qassam.
The cryptocurrency was held on two platforms based outside of the United States, Binance and Tether, according to the warrant application. In October 2023, U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and U.S. Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) wrote a letter asking the DOJ to criminally prosecute Binance and Tether.
“We urge the Department of Justice to carefully evaluate the extent to which Binance and Tether are providing material support and resources to support terrorism through violations of applicable sanctions laws and the Bank Secrecy Act,” Lummis and Hill wrote. “To that end, we strongly support swift action by the Department of Justice against Binance and Tether to choke off sources of funding to the terrorists targeting Israel.”
Tether, at the request of federal law enforcement, on March 12 agreed to freeze about $90,000 worth of virtual currency until the FBI could serve the warrant, according to the application.
The agent wrote that Binance “took independent action” to freeze other related accounts, and provided records to the agent about two accounts owned by Palestinians whom the agent believes are “financiers enabling a virtual currency donation network to support Hamas.”
In announcing the seizures, FBI Albuquerque Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda said in the news release that “countering terrorism remains the FBI’s number one priority.”
“By successfully disrupting access to funds, we weaken their ability to function,” Bujanda said. “This success demonstrates that financial warfare is a critical component to fight terrorism. We will continue to do everything in our power to protect the American people and pursue justice by depriving terrorist organizations of the resources they need to continue their illicit activity.”
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for FBI Albuquerque told Source NM that the investigation is ongoing and declined to answer questions about how the case is connected to New Mexico, and whether anyone has been charged with a crime related to the seized money.
“The FBI investigates many different cases across all of our 55 field offices,” spokesperson Margot Cravens wrote. “We pursue cases based on well-defined investigative strategies. As with all of our investigations, we adjust and refine that strategy based on the results of ongoing leads.”

DemasThe Michigan Supreme Court has declined to take on a lawsuit filed by the Democratic-run state Senate seeking to force the Republican-controlled state House to send a batch of already-passed bills to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for her signature.
The opinion, issued late Wednesday, instead ordered the Michigan Court of Appeals to “expedite its consideration and resolution of this case”, which arose when Michigan Senate Democrats filed a lawsuit to the Court of Claims in February to compel GOP House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) to send nine bills the Legislature passed in the 2023-24 session to the governor for final approval.
The legislation in question was passed during a tumultuous lame duck session late last year when Democrats still had majorities in both chambers — before Republicans took control of the House on Jan. 1 following their victory in the November election. However, the bills were never sent to Whitmer’s office by outgoing House Democrats, who have yet to articulate why they failed to follow through.
 The bills, which Hall refuses to send to the governor, include measures to levy taxes to fund Detroit-area museums, expand eligibility for the State Police Retirement System and increase the amount public employers have to pay towards employees’ health insurance.
In its order, the Michigan Supreme Court said it was “not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court before consideration by the Court of Appeals.”
An initial ruling from Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel determined that while the state Constitution required House leadership to forward the bills to the governor, it doesn’t specify the entity responsible for carrying that task out. As state courts have declined to enforce legislative rules in the past, Patel declined to order the bills be sent for signing.
While both the House and Senate appealed portions of Patel’s decision to the Court of Appeals, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) had asked the state’s Supreme Court to bypass the lower court and take the case directly. Wednesday’s opinion cut that maneuver off.  
Requests for comment were sent to both Brinks and Hall, but have yet to be returned.

(Submitted)TOPEKA — The colorful mural of Kansas wildlife and native plants covering a brick wall in Holton provide inspiration for a state program bringing life the vacant or underused spaces in rural communities.
An exterior wall capturing with paint strokes the dominance of crop, livestock and energy industries in downtown Medicine Lodge and a doorway in Beloit depicting life in an underwater environment accomplish the same objective.
The Kansas Department of Commerce earmarked $125,000 to support new mural projects in cities and towns in rural areas of Kansas in 2025.
The agency’s Office of Rural Prosperity set aside the money to continue an initiative aimed at bringing communities together around local history and culture. The office said mural projects have the potential to improve attractiveness of smaller communities while engaging residents and visitors.
“Public art is a powerful tool for rural revitalization and bringing vitality and prosperity to all regions of our state,” said Lt. Gov. David Toland, who also serves as secretary of the state Department of Commerce.
Trisha Purdon, director of the Office of Rural Prosperity, said the grant program supported 12 mural projects in 2024.
In 2025, she said, the maximum grant award would be $7,500 and would require a 100% match. One-fourth of the match must be in cash, but the remainder could be covered with in-kind contributions.

(Getty Images)Our law school prides itself on graduating “practice ready” attorneys, poised to zealously and ethically represent their clients. But in the first few months of this administration, the practice of law has changed in disturbing ways, and we struggle with how to explain this to our students. Lawyers take an oath to support the Constitution — yet all around us, lawyers are making a mockery of that oath.
Recently, the law firm Paul Weiss capitulated to Donald Trump in a way so brazen and self-defeating that it rattled even those of us already poised to expect cowardice from Big Law. Trump began his campaign of retribution against private law firms that represented clients adverse to him or his allies by revoking the firms’ security clearances and threatening to cancel their clients’ government contracts. A judge halted the first order, directed at the law firm Perkins Coie, stating that it was likely unconstitutional. Nonetheless, Trump then issued a nearly identical order targeting Paul Weiss, and instead of fighting it, Paul Weiss folded.
The firm agreed to give Trump sway over the recipients of $40 million in pro bono services, and, per Trump’s press release, “conduct a comprehensive audit of all its employment practices” and “not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies.” Most chillingly, Trump reported that Paul Weiss “acknowledged the wrongdoing” of former partner Mark Pomerantz, who had worked as a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA’s office on the Trump hush money case.
It is bad enough that Trump is waging this campaign of bald political retribution. It is a different kind of betrayal entirely that Paul Weiss capitulated, especially when the order is likely illegal. Like Skadden and Millbank, which recently negotiated similar deals, Paul Weiss probably believes it is saving its business, but who will employ lawyers in a society devoid of the rule of law?
Lawyers working in this administration would earn failing grades if they were our students. U.S District Court for the Western District of Washington Judge John Cougheneour, granting an injunction against the executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship, said: “Frankly, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar would state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It just boggles my mind.”
Lawyers appearing before U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg made representations about the expulsion of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador that the judge deemed “woefully inadequate.” Judge Boasberg has since faced baseless calls for impeachment.
These attacks on the legal profession, the judiciary, and the rule of law are escalating and relentless. Meanwhile, applications for law school are skyrocketing. We’d like to celebrate. Being a lawyer is a wonderful career, full of opportunities to help people and institutions, enable progress, and solve problems. But how can we defend our profession when so many attorneys are aiding this administration’s assault on the rule of law and enabling this constitutional crisis?
For solace, we look to lawyers who are still doing the right thing in the face of these attacks on our profession. Jenner & Block and WilmerHale have both filed suit against the executive orders targeted at them. Other Big Law associates have protested their firms’ silence in the face of Trump’s executive orders targeting firms. Attorneys remaining in the federal government continue to labor in service to the American people, even though Elon Musk and his allies are deriding them as deadweight and decimating their agencies. Others have taken the brave step of resigning when their ethics have been compromised.
Future lawyers have a role to play, too. Our first-year students are preparing their annual moot court arguments, and have practiced how to be persuasive without misleading the court. Upper-level students know to call out and correct the misinterpretation of legal authorities and the misstatement of facts. Outside the classroom, students have been working to connect immigrants to legal resources. Others have used their developing legal expertise to testify for the first time about legislation in the New Hampshire State House.
Our students are a credit to the future of our profession. No matter their political affiliation or philosophical differences, they will swear fealty to the Constitution. Shame on the lawyers currently making a mockery of that oath. The rest of us will continue to fight for the rule of law, because that’s what we promised to do.

Pat Proctor plans to file as a candidate for secretary of state — a post now held by GOP Secretary of State Scott Schwab.,"Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, said he would seek the Republican Party's nomination in 2026 for secretary of state. The job would be vacant assuming Secretary of State Scott Schwab runs for the GOP nomination for governor. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Rep. Pat Proctor, a retired U.S. Army officer who entered the Kansas Legislature in 2020, launched a campaign for the Republican nomination for secretary of state.
Proctor, of Leavenworth, serves as chairman of the Kansas House elections committee. If elected in November 2026, he would become the state’s top election administrator. The position would be open assuming Secretary of State Scott Schwab continued with a plan to seek the GOP nomination for governor.
Proctor has been among the Legislature’s advocates for election reform bills associated with President Donald Trump’s unproven assertion his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden was fraudulent. Schwab has generally welcomed modernization of state election law, but maintained Kansas elections were fair and secure.
Proctor, 53, announced his candidacy Thursday during an event at a restaurant in Leavenworth.
“Voter confidence that the results of our elections reflect their will is at the core of our form of government and our way of life,” Proctor said. “The best way to restore that confidence is to increase transparency and ensure that only citizens vote in Kansas’ elections.”
Proctor said he played a role in the process of making Kansas “the gold standard for safe and secure elections,” and would continue that work as secretary of state.
During the 2025 legislation session, he supported a bill eliminating the state’s three-day grace period for advance mail-in ballots. Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed the bill, because she felt it was important to count ballots postmarked by Election Day that arrived up to three days late through the U.S. Postal Service. Proctor was part of the House supermajority that voted to override the Democratic governor.
The voting rights organization Loud Light Civic Action recently released video of a private Zoom meeting last year in which Proctor vowed to push through a bill dropping the three-day grace period.
On the same call organized by House Majority Leader Chris Croft with Johnson County Republicans and invite-only guests, Proctor said he would prefer Kansas ended the practice of advance voting.
Proctor has taken a central role among Republicans as the Legislature worked to limit authority of the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission to engage in inquiries of campaign finance violations and election misconduct. That legislative push coincided with the commission’s complex investigation of Republican legislators and campaign workers.
He endorsed Senate Bill 105, which became law without the Kelly’s signature, requiring a Kansas governor to appoint a person to fill vacancies in the offices of U.S. senator, state treasurer and commissioner of insurance from a list of names recommended by the Legislature. The power grab by the Legislature was crafted to prevent Kelly from appointing a Democrat to a vacancy after resignation of a Republican.
Proctor said Kelly unexpectedly signed Senate Bill 6 to forbid the state to take part in ranked-choice voting, which would allow voters to list their candidate preferences in order on the ballot. The process involved tabulating votes in multiple rounds with the elimination of the lowest vote-receiving candidate after each round until a candidate received a majority.
“I am pleasantly surprised that the governor signed SB6, a bill I carried to passage on the House floor to ban ranked-choice voting, into law,” Proctor said. “Nothing is more corrosive to voter confidence than a voting method that requires a two-page explainer to explain to voters.”
In 2023, Proctor was criticized by a Leavenworth family for publishing without permission in his political newsletter a photograph of an elementary school student’s drawing of a rainbow flag. Proctor alleged the drawing was evidence educators in schools were indoctrinating children on LGBTQ politics. Proctor asserted the artwork was part of a “radical, woke agenda.”
Proctor retired from the U.S. Army as a colonel following 25 years of military service that coincided with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In Afghanistan, he was a planning chief for the transition of that war to security forces ahead of the withdrawal of most American forces. During 2009, he deployed to Iraq as an operations officer for an infantry battalion. He worked in Iraq in 2007 on a strategic communication plan for a U.S. troop surge.
He wrote the 2020 book “Lessons Unlearned: The U.S. Army’s Role in Creating the Forever Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.”
While serving in the Legislature, Proctor has taught at Wichita State University. He received a doctorate in history from Kansas State University.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2250143-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-04 12:23:21.259606

Kelly Ayotte speaks with reporters on Election Day, Nov. 5, 2024. (Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Public safety and corporate accountability must be at the top of the list for our next attorney general. John Formella is our attorney general now and his term ends soon. Gov. Kelly Ayotte will nominate a successor for confirmation by the Executive Council; her pick should be someone for whom accountability on the costs of climate change is a priority.
We can thank Formella for holding opioid manufacturers accountable and winning a $40 million settlement to the public benefit of New Hampshire. Quite rightly, his lawsuit called out the manufacturer for creating a public nuisance that interfered with public health and safety. The lawsuit also claimed the manufacturer deceived the public by misrepresenting the safety of its products.
Deception and risks to the public were central to New Hampshire’s 2003 lawsuit against Exxon and other fossil fuel manufacturers over an additive in gasoline, and cited negligence and failure to provide adequate warnings regarding dangers associated with their product. After a decade of litigation, several New Hampshire attorneys general (Ayotte among them) and a three-month-long trial in 2013, the jury needed less than two hours to arrive at a guilty verdict. Exxon paid New Hampshire $236 million; the award is being used today for projects related to cleaning up and protecting drinking water. 
These two lawsuits illustrate New Hampshire at its best: serving under parens patriae, the principle that the state carries with it the responsibility for the protection of its citizens. New Hampshire can rely on this principle to sue fossil fuel companies for their role in climate change. 
Science has determined the causes of climate change. The evidence illustrates that Exxon’s own scientists understood the link between burning fossil fuels and global warming as far back as 1977. Yet Exxon’s leadership chose not to confront the challenge, but instead chose to deny, deceive, and delay, and reap hundreds of billions of dollars in profits. The paper trail is there for all to see.  
Peer-reviewed science has also determined with some precision the role fossil fuel companies have played in contributing to climate change. Published science finds that heat-trapping emissions traced to the world’s largest fossil fuel producers have contributed to nearly half of the rise in temperature and nearly one-third of the observed sea level rise.  
Science now plays a key role in litigation. Today over 30 U.S. cities, counties, and states are suing to hold accountable Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and others to pay their fair share of the costs of climate change. 
Five New England states are suing fossil fuel companies using various consumer protection laws related to consumer fraud, deception, and damages. Climate impacts ignore political borders; it is time for New Hampshire to join Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont. 
Gov. Ayotte’s positions on clean energy and climate have evolved in the right direction since she was our attorney general. As a U.S. senator, Ayotte listened to businesses and scientists. In 2015, in supporting the U.S. EPA’s plan to reduce carbon pollution, Sen. Ayotte explained, “I have decided to support the Clean Power Plan to address climate change through clean energy solutions that will protect our environment.”  
Addressing climate change will protect the environment and businesses, and business leaders in New Hampshire know this. Here are a few comments from a private meeting of 100 business leaders convened in 2014 to address risk and resilience and a changing climate:

“We seem to be getting into a period of climate that some of these storms will not have easy fixes.” — Technology provider
“I had three 100-year storms in five years. Where do you go with that?”— Utility official
“These major storms shut down trucking to various parts of the state and shut down commerce.” — Manufacturer
“Our cost to maintain roads in the woods has about doubled and are today unpredictable.” — Forest products supplier
“Property insurance is increasingly difficult to get on coastlines and you’re going to have to deal with that.” — Financial adviser

The costs to businesses and schools, to towns and cities, to residents and to public health are becoming overwhelming. An expensive new bridge spanning Hampton Harbor is designed for 4 feet of sea level rise; crop losses and washed-out roads occur in every county. Our taxes are already paying for mitigation and repair. It is time for New Hampshire to protect its citizens once again. 
Holding fossil fuel companies accountable for climate damages is consistent with the legal doctrines New Hampshire has relied on in the recent past against opioid manufacturers and polluters. Holding fossil fuel companies accountable needs to be on the short list for the next attorney general, and through her consideration and subsequent nomination Gov. Ayotte has a generational opportunity to make that happen.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ayotteshadows-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 12:23:21.259606

President Donald Trump unveiled a sweeping new tariff plan on April 2, 2025, to reshape U.S. trade and boost domestic industry. 
Framing the announcement as “Liberation Day,” he proposed a 10% tariff on essentially all imports, with steeper rates for major trade partners, including 34% on Chinese goods and 20% on those from the European Union. Starting April 3, a 25% tariff on all foreign-made cars and auto parts will take effect – a move that he says will revive U.S. manufacturing and reset America’s trade agenda.
But the fanfare surrounding the announcement masks a much larger gamble. What’s really at stake is trust – America’s long-standing reputation as a stable and predictable destination for global investment. And once that trust is lost, it’s incredibly hard to win back.
The strategy is presented as a robust defense of American manufacturing and the middle class. But foreign direct investment – when overseas companies build factories or expand operations in the U.S. – depends on more than just opportunity. It depends on certainty.
If global investors start to worry that U.S. trade policy can shift abruptly, they may relocate their capital elsewhere. As such, the administration’s aggressive approach to tariffs risks undermining the very confidence that has long made the U.S. a top destination for global capital.
 Auto tariffs as a case in point

Nowhere is this risk more visible than in the auto industry.
In 2023 alone, the United States attracted over US$148 billion in foreign direct investment, with nearly $42.9 billion tied to manufacturing, including in the automotive sector. Over the past few decades, major global automakers such as Toyota, BMW and Hyundai have established expansive plants in states including Alabama, Ohio and Kentucky.
These facilities – many of which have seen significant reinvestment and expansion in recent years, especially in response to the shift toward electric vehicles – employ thousands of Americans and contribute significantly to local economies.
Trump’s tariff push aims to get automakers to manufacture more vehicles on U.S. soil to overcome rising import costs. It’s a strategy with precedent. During his first term, the threat of auto tariffs, alongside existing plans, helped spur Toyota’s $1.6 billion investment in a North Carolina plant and Volkswagen’s expansion of its operations in Tennessee. It’s not far-fetched to imagine Honda or Mercedes following suit with new factories in Indiana or Texas.
But here’s the catch: “Made in the USA” doesn’t always mean “made for less.” American auto plants often face productivity and efficiency gaps compared with foreign competitors. Labor costs are higher. Assembly lines move more slowly, partly due to stricter labor protections, less automation and aging infrastructure. And U.S. automakers such as Ford and GM still depend heavily on global supply chains. Even for vehicles assembled in America, about 40% of the parts, such as engines from Canada and wiring harnesses from Mexico, are imported.
When those parts are taxed, production costs go up. Moody’s estimates that pickups such as the Ford F-150 and Chevy Silverado could cost $2,000 to $3,000 more as a result. Goldman Sachs projects price hikes of up to $15,000, depending on the vehicle. Automakers then face a dilemma: raise prices and risk losing customers or absorb the costs and cut into their margins.
 A ripple effect across the economy

Tariffs may protect one industry, but their ripple effects reach much further. They raise costs for other sectors that rely on imported inputs, slow down production by making supply chains more expensive and less efficient, squeeze profit margins, and leave businesses and consumers with harder choices.
Factories represent billion-dollar investments that take years to recoup their costs. Mixed signals, such as the president calling tariffs “permanent” one moment and negotiable the next, create a climate of uncertainty. That makes companies more hesitant to build, hire and expand.
And investors are watching closely. If building in the U.S. becomes more expensive and less predictable, is it still a smart long-term bet? When a company is deciding where to build its next battery plant or chip facility, volatility in U.S. policy can be a deal breaker.
The consequences could surface soon. Goldman Sachs has already lowered its 2025 U.S. GDP growth forecast to 1.7%, down from an earlier 2.2%, citing the administration’s trade policy risks. Consumers, still grappling with inflation and high interest rates, may begin to delay big-ticket purchases, especially as tariffs push prices even higher.
 The international fallout

America’s trading partners aren’t standing still. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his country “will fight back – with purpose and with force.” The European Union is exploring duties on American tech firms. Japan, a longtime ally, is signaling unease. If these countries redirect investment to other countries, the U.S. could lose its competitive edge for years to come.
And while roughly 1 million Americans work in the auto manufacturing industry, more than 150 million make up the total American labor force. When tariffs drive up input costs, it can trigger a chain reaction, hurting retailers, stalling service-sector jobs and slowing overall economic growth.
Consumers will feel it too. Higher prices mean lower sales, reduced tax revenues and shrinking profits. All of that weakens the economy at a time when household budgets are already strained.
 Lessons from history

The U.S. has seen how trade policy can shape investment decisions – just in reverse. In the 1980s, Japanese automakers responded to U.S. import quotas not by withdrawing but by building plants in the United States. That response was possible because policies were clear and negotiated, not abrupt or adversarial.
Today, the story is different. Volatile, unilateral tariffs don’t build trust – they erode it. And when trust erodes, so does investment.
Yes, a factory in Indiana or Kentucky might reopen. Yet if that comes at the cost of deterring billions of dollars in long-term investment, is it worth it?
So while the president may celebrate April 2 as Liberation Day, markets may come to see it as the tipping point – when global confidence in the U.S. economy began to falter in earnest.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/U.S. Department of Agriculture)Veterinary experts nationwide have a variety of hypotheses for new and puzzling test results from cow milk being analyzed for avian influenza.
March marked one year since officials first reported Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza — H5N1 — among dairy cattle. Since then, bird flu has infected 996 herds across the country, including 19 cases in the last month in California and Idaho.
New Mexico reported nine dairy herds in Curry County tested positive last April, and began milk testing its cattle in February following the rollout of a federal program.
The most recent results from milk-testing programs revealed that while more than 95% of the 93 cow herds in the state tested negative, a small set of inconsistent positives — all from three Curry County herds infected last year — remain, according to New Mexico State Veterinarian Samantha Holeck.
Enter the mystery: The cows themselves do not test positive, nor do they demonstrate the symptoms documented in the earlier avian flu outbreak, she said, such as huge drops in milk production.
“It’s been a real challenge to try to understand how it continues to circulate in some of these herds,” Holeck said.
New Mexico is partnering up with veterinarians in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research the viral fragments found in the milk and sent samples to the federal National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.
“I know we’re a year into this situation now,” Holeck said, “but it seems like there’s still just so much to try to understand.”
New Mexico isn’t alone in experiencing the viral fragments, said Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian at University of California, Davis, who noted there have been reports of similar persistent positives in quarantined herds there.
“I wouldn’t diminish the importance of it being small,” Payne said. “Yes, we’re talking about low levels of virus and yes, we’re talking about cows not getting sick, but it’s important that we’re not exactly sure where it’s coming from, and that in and of itself merits examination.”
He said more than $2 million dollars of research is being conducted in California on avian flu transmission across a dozen projects; including examining if it’s transmitted by flies; blowing in from dust storms; or carried by birds outside of waterfowl.
“It will be critical that we figure out how the disease is moving and how it’s changing,” Payne said.
‘Science is still very much in its infancy’
While scientists need to perform more research, Payne posited some possibilities for the detection of viral fragments: they could signify a different and less potent version of the virus; cooler weather might allow more viral fragments to survive in the bulk tanks, compared to the triple-digit temperatures in the fall; cows may have developed “herd immunity” against the virus.
“It could be that much smaller numbers of cattle are being exposed and are becoming infected, which has resulted in a much, much lower level of virus that’s being detected inside the bulk tanks,” Payne said. “It’s an area of active research.”
Veterinarian Andrew Bowman, a molecular epidemiologist at Ohio State University, said laboratory tests’ sensitivity could also be a factor: They may be picking up positives from environmental contamination in the tanks or on the farms.
“It doesn’t take much; we’re talking a few copies of the viral genome to be present in a sample to send it positive,” Bowman said. “We can pick up a positive that’s likely not a viable virus.”
Since the development of HPAI in cows is so new, as is the method of transmission — where the virus replicates in the mammary glands that produce milk — he said the basic questions of the interactions between the virus, the host and the environment still need answers.
“Science is still very much in the infancy of what we know about avian influenza in cattle,” Bowman said.
Offering reassurances
While scientists say it’s important to unravel the mystery of the viral fragments to better understand how the virus might change or spread in dairy cows, they also emphasize that risk to the public from avian influenza remains low.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports transmission of avian flu can occur from contact with milk from infected cows; eating, drinking or inhaling droplets contaminated with live virus; touching the live or dead bodies of infected animals. Thus far, the CDC has no documented human-to-human transmission. As of April 1, 70 people had contracted H5N1, mostly California farmworkers.
Most milk sold in the U.S. is heated to a temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, called pasteurization. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested milk products in 17 states and, finding no live viruses, reported that “pasteurization is effective at inactivating H5N1, and that the commercial, pasteurized milk supply is safe.”
Federal officials, however, warn that unpasteurized milk, also called raw milk, is unsafe to drink. Research from the National Institutes of Health in June using infected raw milk from New Mexico found that the H5N1 virus had survived for at least five weeks in refrigerated conditions. Further, mice that consumed the raw milk showed signs of illness, which researchers suggest indicates drinking raw milk can transmit the virus to other organisms.
Holeck emphasized that New Mexico milk is safe.
“For dairies, it’s standard routine if they have sick cows for any reason, not just [avian flu], that milk is always diverted out from the milk supply, it doesn’t enter commerce,” she said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dairy-cows-USDA-photo-by-Lance-Cheung-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 11:09:16.864129

Larry Rhoden speaks to reporters during a press conference on March 31, 2025, at the state Capitol in Pierre. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)During the recently completed legislative session, there were a couple of discussions in a House State Affairs Committee meeting that may have a direct bearing on South Dakota’s future.
One topic was what to call a tax that has never before been implemented. At issue was House Bill 1138 which would have created a tax on advertising with the revenue to be used for property tax relief. Currently advertising is exempt from taxation.
Sen. Taffy Howard, a Rapid City Republican and a sponsor of the legislation, looked into the future and saw that opponents of the bill would call it a new tax. Howard testified that she preferred to call it a “tax shift” that was undoing an earlier tax shift that put the advertising tax on the exempt list.
Howard’s prediction was correct as Steve Willard, president of the South Dakota Broadcasters Association, said it was a new tax since no one has ever had to pay it. “It’s brand new to them,” Willard said of the advertisers who would have to pay the tax. “They went from not having one to having one, which to me seems new.”
Governor proposes county sales tax option to reduce residential property taxes

The other discussion came just prior to the vote on the bill, while committee members listed their reasons for voting against it. Never mind that no other state in the union has a tax on advertising or that implementing the tax would certainly mean adding more personnel to the Department of Revenue. Lawmakers didn’t seem put off by the constitutional argument that a tax on advertising is a tax on free speech.
What put them off was that they had not yet given enough consideration to making budget cuts. Rep. Bethany Soye, a Sioux Falls Republican, said legislators had two choices when it came to property tax relief: cut spending or increase taxes. If lawmakers insisted that taxes shouldn’t go up, Soye said, then there needed to be cuts made.
Her thoughts were echoed by Rep. Jon Hansen, a Dell Rapid Republican who serves as speaker of the House. Hansen said the driver behind high property taxes was excessive growth in government and excessive spending. “We owe it to the people to look first to the cuts,” Hansen said.
This conversation reflected comments made later in the session by House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, who said that property taxes were too high due to excessive spending by counties and schools.
In a South Dakota Searchlight story the Spearfish Republican said, “You’re not going to get property tax relief until you look at the spending done by our public school system and our counties, because that’s where local property taxes go.”
The story noted that this was a change in tone for lawmakers who, two years ago, conducted a summer study about ways to help cash-strapped counties. After the summer study, the Legislature spent $10 million to help local governments with cybersecurity and the cost to counties for public defenders or court-appointed attorneys.
These conversations point to a hard road ahead for Gov. Larry Rhoden, who proposed an optional half-percent county sales tax with the revenue to be used for reducing property taxes for homeowners.

Rhoden has already shepherded a property tax bill through the Legislature. The multifaceted law includes temporary caps on countywide increases in residential assessments, and on the amount local governments can grow their property tax collections based on new construction. By choosing a cap rather than budget cuts, and now by offering counties a sales tax, Rhoden has cast himself as a leader who would rather not disrupt county and school budgets.
Like Howard and her “tax shift” advertising tax, Rhoden is seeking a way to explain his proposal that doesn’t include the words “new tax.” Like Howard, he’s struggling. In a South Dakota Searchlight story, the governor said tourists were likely to pay some of the county sales tax. “Realistically, it’s a tax decrease for the citizens of the state,” Rhoden claimed. Only in the world of politics does a new tax equal a “tax decrease.”
However Rhoden explains his county sales tax for property tax relief, he’s certain to run up against a budget-cutting crowd of lawmakers who believe that counties and schools aren’t doing enough to restrain spending.
Rhoden has shown real political skill during his short time as governor, including his successful effort to get his property tax bill through a crowded field of competing legislation. Let’s see if those skills can handle selling a new revenue source for counties to tax-shy, budget-cutting Republican lawmakers.

(Jason Kempin/Getty Images)The nation’s historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, are wondering how to survive in an uncertain and contentious educational climate as the Trump administration downsizes the scope and purpose of the U.S. Department of Education — while cutting away at federal funding for higher education.
In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.












There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.

Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
 ‘None of them are equitable’

In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”
Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
 Economic anchors

There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.
Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”
For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from the states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — With gender-affirming care for minors now banned in Kansas, the weight of their transgender care falls largely on mental health providers.
Providers at Interpersonal Psychiatry in Lawrence say the new Kansas law coupled with national anti-trans efforts by President Donald Trump paint a grim picture for the next four years.
Ruby Mae Johnson, CEO of Interpersonal Psychiatry, said the practice is expecting an influx of therapy appointments for LGBTQ+ patients, especially transgender patients.
“Everybody I know in the trans community in particular has, if they have access to it, increased their own therapy,” Johnson said. “As a transgender woman myself, I’m feeling empathy. I’m feeling the same things that our patients are feeling. There’s simply just a lot of fear — not just about what’s in the statute, but what it might signal going forward.”
Senate Bill 63 bans gender-affirming puberty blockers, hormone therapies or surgeries for minors. State employees are not allowed to “promote” social transitioning or gender-affirming medical care.
Interpersonal Psychiatry is a private practice and doesn’t receive any state funding. Johnson expects more transgender minors in Kansas to look at private mental health practices for care, because she sees state-funded practices as vulnerable to funding cuts or future bans.
“That’s going to increase the need for services, and more costly interventions, too,” Johnson said. “Without support, people will die. This will cost lives. We know that one of the surest ways to prevent death by suicide among queer youth in general and transgender youth specifically, is simply to support and acknowledge who they are. And when the political fabric of the state or the country is dedicating a pretty significant amount of energy to saying, ‘No, you’re not that person,’ that’s going to cost lives.”

Emily Feingold is a therapist at Interpersonal Psychiatry. She says that while the new law will have detrimental mental health effects on the LGBTQ+ population, it lacks “teeth.”
The law outlines repercussions for medical providers who provide gender-affirming care, but Feingold says nobody can police what a therapist talks to their client about.
“Nobody is controlling what I do with my clients. And in terms of insurance coverage, it all has to do with what I write in my notes. I’m going to continue to meet the needs of my clients,” Feingold said.
Feingold said while she’s no longer allowed to recommend medical care, the symptoms of gender dysphoria still exist.
“Instead of treating these kids with hormones, we’re going to treat them with psychotropic meds,” Feingold said. “Do we want that? Is that better? We’re just kicking the can farther down the road, because that person’s gender identity is not going to change.”
Johnson said trans kids will deal with the impact for the rest of their lives: “It sucks to have never looked in the mirror and seen a young woman.”
The law was passed after a years-long effort as a result of the expanded Republican supermajority. After Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed it, her veto was overridden 85-34 in the House and 31-9 in the Senate.
Rep. Mark Schreiber of Emporia was the only Republican who supported Kelly’s veto. Schreiber’s daughter was born with birth defects, and while she’s not transgender, Schreiber said he empathized with parents of transgender minors.
“A parent that has a child that needs specialized care of any kind will go to great lengths to see that the child gets that care, whether it’s physical, mental, whatever it might be,” Schreiber said. “I don’t think trans kids are any different than our daughter.”
Schreiber voted against the law when it first came to the House floor, then again in support of Kelly’s veto. Schreiber said that after his first vote, he heard feedback from Kansans.
“The first thing that they conveyed to me was fear that they’re not going to be able to provide care for their child,” Schreiber said. “As a parent of a child that had major medical difficulties, I cannot fathom that.”
Wichita Republican Sen. Renee Erickson, who introduced the bill, told Kansas Reflector she’s “not interested in talking to anyone” about the law.
In 2023, Erickson supported Senate Bill 180 — which defines a person’s gender as “biological sex, either male or female, at birth.” She also championed legislation that banned transgender athletes from school sports, and a proposed law this year that would police the use of preferred pronouns in schools.
The city of Lawrence responded to attacks on the transgender community by passing an ordinance declaring Lawrence as a transgender safe haven. Johnson, the Interpersonal Psychiatry CEO, testified in support of the ordinance, crediting the Lawrence community with providing a space comfortable for her transition.
After the 2024 presidential election, Johnson worried her gender identity would make Interpersonal Psychiatry a target. She considered leaving the country but decided to stay — in large part because of the LGBTQ+ community in Lawrence.
“We have always been committed to the LGBT+ population,” Johnson said. “We are just going to double down on our commitment to show up for our communities.”
The practice sponsored an LGBTQ+ prom, and Johnson is running for Lawrence City Commission.
“I won’t say it gets better, because I never tell anybody that anything will be OK — because I don’t know. But I will say, we’re all here,” Johnson said. “We’ve got your back.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ruby-and-Emily-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-04 10:04:41.823180

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill that seeks to solve a nearly $200 million state budget deficit, but legislators failed to approve spending from a state savings account, something needed to fix the deficit.
House Bill 56, which passed on a 21-19 vote, is a “fast-track supplemental” budget bill designed to address the current fiscal year, which ends June 30.
Because of lower-than-expected oil prices and higher-than-expected costs, there isn’t enough money in the budget to pay for spending through the end of the year. That’s caused lawmakers to turn to the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s principal savings account.
“The vote we’re taking today is just about paying for what we’ve already authorized,” said Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee, before the vote. “These items we’ve already authorized are for these immediate-term priorities like disaster relief, fire protection and ongoing lawsuits that were brought to us by the governor.”
Spending from the reserve requires three-quarters of the 40-person House and three-quarters of the 20-person Senate, plus the assent of the governor.
But on Thursday, only 21 members of the House voted in favor of the clause that unlocks the budget reserve. All of the “no” votes came from members of the House’s Republican minority caucus. All of the “yes” votes came from the House’s multipartisan majority.
If the bill fails to pass the Legislature, Gov. Mike Dunleavy would be forced to make unilateral cuts to the state budget, impounding funding for various programs.
For the moment, that’s a distant prospect.
Despite the failed budget reserve vote, HB 56 will advance to the Senate — 21 votes is the minimum needed to advance a bill from the House to the Senate — but the failed vote means that the House will need to revote on the budget reserve clause once the Senate acts.
“We’re still early in the process,” said House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage.
Historically, members of the House minority have withheld support for the CBR vote until after the Senate approves the bill.
By waiting, the minority preserves its negotiating leverage, Costello said. That makes it less likely that minority-opposed provisions will be added to the bill.
In addition, it’s possible that the fast-track budget bill will later be combined with the budget bill for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1. So-called “turducken” budget bills have previously included one budget reserve vote for both fiscal years.
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake and a member of the minority caucus, said before Thursday’s vote that the fast-track bill lacks minority input and that as a result, he could not support it. 
As currently written, the bill would use savings to pay for more than $111 million in previously unforeseen spending, including millions for wildfire response, Medicaid and disaster aid. Those additions were requested by the governor to meet state needs. 
One late-adopted amendment, approved Thursday by the House, restored a funding request for village public safety officers, who serve a police and lifesaving role in rural Alaska communities.
On top of the additional spending, revenue is down about $80 million from what had been expected last year. 
The Senate Finance Committee has already scheduled hearings for HB 56, indicating that it may move quickly toward a vote of the full Senate.
Even if the fast-track supplemental budget is adopted in time, lawmakers still must resolve an expected deficit in the 2026 fiscal year, which starts July 1. The House is expected to begin debate on a budget bill for that fiscal year next week.

Compared to last year, DCNR reports a nearly 30% increase in campsite reservations for the summer. As of March 31, 24% of campsites for the state’s 124 parks and 20 forests have already been reserved for its “peak season” between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
“Pennsylvanians and visitors alike are embracing the outdoors like never before,” said DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn. “With increased demand for camping, we encourage everyone to plan ahead and take advantage of the many beautiful sites still available.”
DCNR also cites some federal campgrounds closing  due to staffing shortages as one reason behind the boost in campsite reservations.

Prince Gallitzin, Bald Eagle, Greenwood Furnace, and Trough Creek state parks are currently the most popular locations with large lakes for boating, fishing, and swimming. Trough Creek, located in Huntingdon County, saw the largest increase with a 189% boost in reservations in March 2025 in comparison to the same time last year, according to DCNR.
In February, the Trump administration fired approximately 1,000 newly hired National Park Service employees as a result of efforts from the Department of Government Efficiency.
All state parks in Pennsylvania offer free entrance year round.
In an effort to promote camping in the state, DCNR has also relaunched its gift certificate program, which can be used for reservations on campsites, cabins, picnic pavilions, and state-operated retail purchases. DCNR’s website also provides a calendar of events on public lands. 
Reservations can be made for campsites and lodging at visitPAparks.com or by calling 888-PA-PARKS (888-727-2757), Monday through Saturday, 7:00 AM – 5:00 PM.

(George Frey/Getty Images)Lawmakers were split on what to do with a proposal to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines, defined as having more than 10 rounds of ammunition. 
During a work session Thursday evening, Rep. David Sinclair (D-Bath) asked the bill sponsor if it would defeat the intent of the bill to focus on the trafficking of those magazines and increase the limit to 20 rounds, rather than criminalize possession.
“Instead of making the substantial progress I would hope to make with the bill, that would be incremental progress,” said Rep. Matthew Beck (D-South Portland), who introduced LD 1109 to address what he described as a “common denominator” among many of the deadliest mass shootings. 
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee was divided on the bill, with seven members voting against it, including two Democrats, and five supporting amended versions. Two members were absent for the vote. 
The majority of Democrats on the committee were split between Sinclair’s proposal to focus on trafficking and an amendment from committee co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) to mimic Vermont law by limiting magazines to 10 rounds for long guns and 15 for handguns. Carney’s changes would also provide a way to grandfather in magazines people already lawfully own. 
Beck’s version of the bill would apply retroactively to magazines people currently own and give them 180 days to dispose of or alter them to meet the new requirements. 
In response to questions about how the state would determine which guns would be grandfathered in, Carney added language requiring Maine State Police to develop a process. Two other Democrats joined Carney on her amended proposal. 
While Carney said she is sympathetic to the concerns about criminalizing items people purchased legally, Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) criticized the bill for penalizing law-abiding citizens. She argued that people with ill intent will find a way to possess illegal firearms, regardless of what laws are on the books. 
Rep. Dylan Pugh (D-Portland), who was the only member to back the amendment proposed by Sinclair, pushed back on the argument that focusing on trafficking wouldn’t stop mass shootings and said that criminalizing guns that people already own would be an overly-broad encroachment of one’s rights. 
The committee also worked on bills related to the definition of machine guns and requiring serial numbers on ghost guns, but those were tabled for further discussion without a vote.

About 200 people turned out in rainy weather to rally outside UPMC headquarters in downtown Pittsburgh Thursday evening. Standing under rainbow umbrellas and waving trans pride flags, they rebuked the health care giant for rolling back young people’s access to gender-affirming care.
Advocacy groups including TransYOUniting, the Pennsylvania Youth Congress and others organized the action after learning that UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh had stopped providing gender-affirming health services to LGBTQ+ kids. They viewed the move as a capitulation to the Trump administration’s plan to exclude trans people from public life.
Several children were in attendance, including Oliver, 10, of Lawrenceville who waved a “Protect Trans Kids” sign while chanting slogans with the crowd. “I’m mad because I’m transgender,” they said.
PublicSource is withholding Oliver’s last name at the request of their parent, K.T. Fishbein, an echocardiographer at Children’s Hospital. Like most trans and nonbinary children, Oliver isn’t seeking gender-affirming care yet. But Fishbein “was pretty upset” by their employer’s decision to deny care to the children who need it, and worries that Oliver and others may not have access in the future.
“I love what I do at Children’s. I love my community there,” Fishbein said. “But this makes you feel really let down.”

During the rally, organizers attempted to deliver a letter signed by Mayor Ed Gainey and 14 other state and local officials to UPMC leadership. It wasn’t accepted, but it called on the executives to:

Immediately restore access to gender-affirming care at Children’s Hospital
Establish an advisory committee that includes trans youth to oversee administration of care
Fund alternative providers if a court order bars it from providing gender-affirming care, among other demands.

“… You are choosing to send a devastating message to the entire trans community that their health and futures are negotiable under political pressure,” they wrote to UPMC executives. “Continuing to provide comparable medical care to cisgender young people but not transgender youth is discrimination.”
In a speech, Gainey told rallygoers to “stand up and force UPMC to do the right thing.” Asked if the city has the leverage to pressure UPMC to restore access to gender-affirming care, he wrote, “the City of Pittsburgh has laws on the books to ensure people have equal access to health care regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.”
“My administration’s law department is examining legal avenues to enforce our city’s non-discrimination policies, and we expect health systems that operate here to follow the law,” he said in a statement to PublicSource after the rally.
Rallies were also held today in Erie, Altoona, Lancaster, and Lewisburg — all cities where UPMC operates.

In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that threatens to pull federal funding from hospitals, medical schools and other institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, which it defines as those under age 19. The order’s language specifically mentions puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery — all of which are medically necessary for those who suffer from gender dysphoria, according to a consensus among major medical associations.
A federal judge in Maryland extended a nationwide injunction last month that blocks enforcement of the order. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a question about its compliance with the court, though it said in February that the order is “already having its intended effect.” The statement listed six hospitals, including one in Philadelphia, that were pausing or reviewing gender-affirming services for minors.
Some large health systems quickly bent to the pressure and began turning young LGBTQ+ patients away just days after Trump signed the executive order. UPMC may have waited longer before quietly changing its policies around gender-affirming care for minors. Patients and their families told reporters last month that its providers had stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormones. And it canceled an 18-year-old’s top surgery, which was scheduled for March 24.

A spokesperson wrote that UPMC is monitoring federal directives that affect its ability to provide “specific types of care” to patients under 19. “We continue to offer necessary behavioral health and other support within the bounds of the law. We empathize with the patients and families who are directly affected by these ongoing changes.”
The spokesperson didn’t answer detailed questions about UPMC’s rationale for denying young patients who need gender-affirming care, the role federal funding may have played in that decision, and the specific services it chose to eliminate.
Advocates characterized UPMC’s actions as a shocking and premature indulgence of the administration’s anti-trans agenda. They pointed to lawsuits arguing the executive order is unconstitutional, the nationwide injunction blocking its enforcement and the City of Pittsburgh’s sanctuary laws shielding providers from criminalization.
“What UPMC is doing is preemptive and there’s no basis for it,” said Dena Stanley, a lead organizer of the rally and the executive director of TransYOUniting. The nonprofit serves LGBTQ+ and HIV-positive people, and helps run the QMNTY Center, a safe haven for the community on the North Side.
“We all understand what Trump is trying to do, but they also have power,” she said, noting that UPMC has the legal resources to “stand up and fight back.”
Stanley pointed out that UPMC is a major provider of gender-affirming surgeries in Western Pennsylvania. Its domination of the regional market leaves young people who need top surgeries with few alternatives unless they can afford to travel. “These children are just devastated,” she said. “And their families are devastated.”
Allegheny Health Network, the region’s other big health system, offers gender-affirming care at its Center for Inclusion Health, a low-barrier clinic on the North Side. Its Transgender Health Program provides primary care and surgical services including facial feminization and chest reconstruction.
“AHN remains committed to supporting the comprehensive needs of these patients, including primary care, surgical care and mental health support, while complying with all applicable laws,” a spokesperson wrote in response to detailed questions.
Some independently owned clinics are opening their doors to the young trans and queer patients who were denied care by UPMC. About two weeks ago, providers from Children’s Hospital started referring these patients to Allegheny Reproductive Health Center— an East Liberty clinic offering a range of gender-affirming services, according to Sheila Ramgopal, the center’s chief executive and an obstetrician and gynecologist.
Ramgopal said the providers were distraught while they spoke with the center’s staff, explaining they had been pulled into “a closed-door meeting” with UPMC executives. The executives reportedly told them they could no longer provide gender-affirming services to LGBTQ+ children, including hormone therapy and surgical services.

“We’re getting emails and messages from these providers who are desperately trying to find their clients care … My hats off to them for really trying to find places where people can go and still be safe, and hopefully they don’t get in trouble for doing that.”
If UPMC continues this policy in the long-term, Ramgopal predicted that some gender-affirming care providers will leave its system to treat young patients elsewhere. But non-compete agreements may bar them from working for other employers in the county, which means the region would lose their medical expertise unless UPMC agrees to not to enforce those agreements, they said.
Ramgopal said there’s precedent: UPMC allows abortion providers to leave its system for jobs at Allegheny Reproductive Health Center, Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania and other independent facilities in the county. But they’re still barred from joining the AHN system.
“My hope is this would be a negotiable issue with UPMC,” they said. “There’s a lot of providers who live and work in Pittsburgh who want to continue to do this work here.”
A spokesperson didn’t answer a question about UPMC’s flexibility around non-compete agreements.

Greg Gianforte has made it clear that he wants the Legislature to pass income tax cuts for the third time since his election in 2020. 
This session, he wants to lower the state’s top tax rate — the rate most Montanans pay — by a full percentage point during the next two years. 
But the legislation he is backing — touted in his budget proposal last year, his State of the State address in January, and in multiple press conferences throughout the legislative session — has stalled in the Senate, while different proposals that take a narrower focus of lowering taxes for middle-income earners have received bipartisan support from lawmakers. 
The governor’s preferred proposal, Senate Bill 323, carried by Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, had a hearing before the Senate Taxation Committee earlier this week. The bill would lower the top tax bracket (Montana has two brackets) from 5.9% to 5.4% next year, and down to 4.9% the following year. It would also expand the earned income tax credit from 10% to 15%.
 The bill was tabled in committee.
On Wednesday, Kassmier made a motion to blast the bill out of committee to the floor in order to let the entire Senate debate its merits, but the motion failed. 
“While I join all Montanans in being disappointed with the Senate’s vote yesterday, I am optimistic that by working together, we can get (income tax cuts) done for the Montanans who sent us here. And we must,” Gianforte said at a press conference on Thursday.

Meanwhile, two competing proposals that were also tabled in committees, Senate Bill 203, brought by Sen. Mike Yakawich, R-Billings, and Senate Bill 546, brought by Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, were blasted to the floor on Wednesday. 
Yakawich’s bill passed an initial Senate vote earlier this week 47-3 before the Senate Finance and Claims Committee tabled it. 
Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, who leads the taxation committee, said he supported the “good bipartisan bill” coming back to the floor for a final vote, drawing contrasts to Kassmier’s bill.
“We know 323 was tabled. And the reason why? It started at the top,” Hertz said. “We’re starting at the bottom here. It’s a middle class tax cut. If you don’t want to bring this to the floor, you’re voting against a middle-class tax cut.”
Rather than cut the top tax bracket rate, SB 203 would expand the lower bracket — taxed at 4.7% — to include individuals making as much as $100,000. For married couples filing jointly the bracket delineation would be at $200,000, which Yakawich has said will cover up to the 90th percentile of earners. 
SB 203 passed the Senate in a final vote Thursday 31-19 and was sent to the House.
In convincing the Senate to hear SB 546 on the floor, Fern called it the “largest middle-class tax cut that’s being presented.”
“I have one of the best kept secrets in this chamber. This is great competition for middle class tax cuts. And I would love the opportunity to present this innovative, interesting, out of the box bill to all of you.”
The blast motion was successful, and the Senate debated the measure during Thursday’s session. 
Rather than tinker with the income tax rates, Fern’s proposal would create an income-based tax credit targeting exclusively the lower and middle income taxpayers. 
While he called the text a “mouthful,” Fern said the Middle Income Tax Reduction, MITR, would subtract a percentage of a filer’s tax liability, starting at 4.7% of taxable income and stepping down a percentage for additional income. 
Using a teacher filing jointly as an example, with a Montana taxable income of $70,000, Fern said those folks would receive about $930 as a tax credit.
“I suggest that MITR is the best bill that targets what I call a silent majority of our citizens and taxpayers. The MITR assures savings and spending so that dollars stay at home,” Fern said. “We’re not treating our middle class taxpayers, I think, with the respect they deserve.”
Speaking in opposition to the bill, Hertz said that lawmakers faced a decision over two bills that both cost $200 million a year. 
“(We) can’t have both of them. We’re going to have to choose one or the other. Although we might be able to do a hybrid method.”
He said Fern’s bill was too complicated by essentially creating “50 new tax brackets” due to the percentage-graded credit. He also expressed concern that it would make it harder for tax software companies to tailor their products for Montana, which presents a small portion of their customer base. 
“It doesn’t meet my simplification test,” he said. 
In support, Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, said he was happy to see Democrats bring forth an income tax bill — which the party traditionally has opposed — specifically one so focused on lower-income earners. 
“For years, the income tax reduction proposals that have come here have done the same thing. They’ve primarily benefited taxpayers at the highest level,” Flowers said. “And who needs an income tax reduction? Is it somebody making $500,000 a year? No.”
Fern said that the bill could be amended to mesh with Yakawich’s, if the Legislature found that to be the best compromise on policy. 
The chamber passed the bill 28-21.

The other major income tax cut bill moving through the Legislature is House Bill 337, introduced by Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage.
Ler’s bill falls in between the Yakawich proposal and the governor’s plan, It contains both a slight reduction in the top tax rate from 5.9% to 5.4%, and an expansion of the lower, 4.7% bracket up to $70,000 for individual filers, and $100,000 for joint filers. 
Tax day is less than two weeks away, and on the House floor Monday, Ler said he’d heard from many folks who were getting hit on their taxes from last year. His bill, he said, would benefit everyone. 
“This bill is aimed to lowering all income tax brackets. This will help all Montanans whether you’re low income or high income,” Ler said. 
The measure passed along party lines. 
In his press conference Thursday, Gianforte said that proposals aimed at expanding the lower tax bracket “only benefit a portion of Montanans.”
“Carving out special groups and giving special breaks to special interests or special groups of Montanans is just not fair,” the governor said. 
Pushed by reporters whether he was concerned that higher income Montanans wouldn’t receive a tax cut, Gianforte reiterated that his ultimate goal was to create a single, flat-tax rate for everyone.
 “It’s just basically fair,” he said. “You have a fairer system because everyone shares the burden based on their income level.”
He said that while his goal was to get a full 1% decrease in the top tax rate, “there can be honest debate about how much to reduce the top rate.”
He added that no lawmakers had approached him to discuss alternate tax plans. 
“If there’s a concern in the Legislature, let’s have a discussion,” he said. “None of those legislators have come to me to talk to me about an alternative proposal, so I would welcome the discussion. Let’s get around the table and figure this out for the people of Montana.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1040-forms-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-04 09:02:54.657037

Michael Johnson, R-Tega Cay, speaks Tuesday, April 1, 2025, at a subcommittee hearing on a bill that would permit betting on horse racing through online apps. (Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — Members of the state’s struggling equestrian community say legislation allowing South Carolinians to bet on horse racing through an app on their phone could revive a once-thriving industry.
Discussion opened this week in a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on a bipartisan proposal led by Sen. Michael Johnson, R-Tega Cay.
No vote was taken. There could be several more meetings before that happens.
It’s one of several bills filed this year to allow gambling in some form.
Advocates contend South Carolina misses out on millions in potential revenue from betting as it becomes more prominent — both legally and illegally.
Of the proposals, the bill dubbed the Equine Advancement Act likely has the best odds of passing.
However, even with the backing of one of the Legislature’s most powerful players — Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler of Gaffney — it’s far from a sure bet in a Legislature that has historically avoided any change to the state’s anti-gambling laws. Nonprofit raffles didn’t become legal until 2015.
The proposal would allow gambling on horse racing on approved apps while specifying that other forms of gambling, such as slot machines or video poker, remain illegal.
That’s an attempt to quell concerns about re-opening the door to an industry that went gangbusters on the authority of a little-noticed clause slipped into the state budget in 1986.
“This bill is very narrowly tailored,” Johnson said. “The goal is to take the proceeds from this and pump that directly into our equine industry — horse training, horse farms, horse racing, all of those things — so that they have an opportunity to compete with the other states that already have this.”
His legislation — which is going through Peeler’s committee — will likely advance to the floor.
That would follow the recent precedent of two similar bills sponsored by former GOP Sen. Katrina Shealy of Lexington. Those bills advanced through her committee to reach the floor in 2022 and 2024, but neither ever got a vote in the chamber.
It’s unclear whether the gambling foes in the Senate can still block debate, or whether there’s been enough of a sea change in the chamber’s mindset that it actually has a chance. Few senators are left who participated in the Legislature’s fight to get rid of video poker and vowed not to allow a repeat.
After all, it’s been 25 years since a state Supreme Court ruling made video poker illegal.
Notably, November brought 13 new senators, the largest freshman class in the 46-member Senate in at least a generation. They include former Rep. Russell Ott, who was the chief sponsor of the horse race betting bill that the House passed on a 55-46 vote in 2023.
Should senators open floor debate on the latest proposal, Sen. Chip Campsen said he’ll be providing the uninitiated a lengthy history lesson.
“We have a terrible history when it comes to gambling in South Carolina, and I don’t want my children or my grandchildren raised in a place like South Florida,” said the Isle of Palms Republican, who was in the House when the multibillion-dollar video poker industry overplayed its hand with a lawsuit that backfired.
“You want to go gamble, gamble in Florida, but don’t make us Florida. Don’t make us Las Vegas,” Campsen said.
Representatives of both the Palmetto Family Council and the South Carolina Baptist Convention, which have successfully lobbied against gambling bills in the past, told the SC Daily Gazette they will continue to fight the proposals.
“When you use something like a vice to promote income or revenue, you always have to have more of it,” said Tony Beam, a lobbyist for the Baptist Convention. “It doesn’t do anything to make a state better.”
Even if a pro-gambling bill manages to make it to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk, it faces an almost guaranteed veto from the Republican who has opposed gambling over his entire career.
“Once you start letting gambling into the house, it will grow,” McMaster said Tuesday, making clear his position hasn’t changed.
“Gambling is bad for our culture,” he continued. “It’s not part of our heritage and there are better ways to make money, to give jobs, to generate tax money, to generate a thriving economy.”
The argument for apps
The horse industry brings in $2 billion annually and is responsible for nearly 29,000 jobs, according to a 2019 state-commissioned study from the Department of Agriculture.
Advocates told senators Tuesday the industry is being decimated as horses and trainers leave South Carolina — once a hot spot for horse owners due to its climate and abundance of rural land — for states like Virginia and New York that offer incentives for horses that are bred and certified in the state.
Farms and horse barns that once served as community sanctuaries are disappearing and being replaced by office buildings or parking lots, said Frank Mullins, president of the Aiken Steeplechase, held in a city where many of the roads are purposefully left unpaved for equestrian traffic.
SC equestrians call for Senate to pass bill legalizing horse race betting

“It’s not good for the essence of our state, not good for the ambience of our small towns,” Mullins said.
“We have an opportunity to reverse this,” he continued. “Allowing horse race betting in South Carolina will give us an opportunity to be competitive with other states.”
Mullins said the facilities for the steeplechase get used only twice a year for competition. Should there be legalized betting, he’ll likely add additional races.
“My singular goal is to try to find a way to use this place more than twice a year,” he said.
South Carolina would join 41 states that permit online gambling on horse races, according to the Action Network, a sports media company focused on gambling.
North Carolina legalized it in March 2024, but there are no entities licensed to offer or accept horse racing bets in the state, according to the North Carolina State Lottery Commission website.
As for the details, Johnson’s proposal would create a seven-member board to manage the program and license the apps that people could use for betting; 5% of all wagers would go to the industry. The commission would decide how to dole out that money, which could include vocational schooling, renovating training centers or supplementing prize money for horse races.
The gambling industry is dangling lots of carrots.
A 2022 analysis by Racing Resource Group, an analytics business specializing in horse racing, projected the state would see at least $40 million in horse racing wagers and as much as $70 million. The proposed 5% would translate to $2 million to $3.5 million annually for the industry under those estimates.
However, advocates say they’re optimistic wagers will surpass $70 million once the betting is legalized and gambling increases — which is precisely what gambling opponents worry about.
Kip Elser, who was speaking on behalf of the South Carolina and Thoroughbred and Breeders Association and the state’s Equine Council, said $2 million is the minimum the industry needs to start bouncing back.
GOP Sen. Billy Garrett of Greenwood, an opponent of the bill, suggested the council simply ask for the money as an earmark in the state budget. The money could go through the state’s Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, as many millions of dollars do annually.
But Elser said legalizing betting would be better for equestrians.
“We would rather get a leg up and be self-supported,” he said.
‘Quit burying our heads in the sand’
There are other bills that would allow wide-open gambling, though none have gotten a hearing.
Rep. Chris Murphy, a Dorchester County Republican, is the lead sponsor of a bipartisan bill that would allow the state’s first casino to be built near the intersection of interstates 26 and 95 in Orangeburg County.
The bill relegates permission to the state’s poorest counties.
It starts off with the declaration that “casino gaming is not consistent with nor compatible with the economic, labor, or tourism industry profile for most communities in South Carolina.”
However, it continues, for the “rural and impoverished school districts” along I-95, “casino gaming in these counties is consistent and compatible with their economic, labor, and tourism profiles” as a potential job creator and education opportunity enhancer for the children living there.
Other proposals in the House and Senate would regulate sports gambling in the state.
Still another proposes asking voters in a referendum whether the constitution should be amended to allow the Legislature to pass laws legalizing gambling, with the profits paying for roadwork wherever gambling is allowed.
Putting that question on the ballot avoids McMaster’s veto, since such resolutions don’t go to the governor’s desk. But the measure would still require supermajority votes in each chamber, which is highly unlikely.
Proponents argue gambling is already happening; the state’s just not making any money off the illegal, unregulated transactions.
Sen. Brad Hutto, D-Orangeburg, said people gamble on horse races anyway, whether it’s at the Aiken Steeplechase or the Carolina Cup in Camden. He’s seen it often, he told his colleagues.
Ott, who is a co-sponsor of Johnson’s bill, said if the Legislature made gambling legal, the state would not only profit from it but could regulate it and put money into programs combatting gambling addiction.
“It’s just time for us to quit burying our heads in the sand, acting like this is not happening right now in the state of South Carolina,” said the St. Matthews Democrat. “It’s time for us to get caught up with times and to use it in a way that can be a real benefit.”

Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who voted against the proposed changes.   The committee held [&#8230;]","Guns are shown at Caso’s Gun-A-Rama in Jersey City, New Jersey, which has been open since 1967. (Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)With four proposals to amend Maine’s laws regarding the concealed carry of a firearm, the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee is suggesting to keep current practice in place.
“I think we do have a good balance right now in our constitutional carry law,” said Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who voted against the proposed changes.  
The committee held a work session Thursday for a slate of gun legislation. While some measures were tabled for further discussion, the four bills about where someone can have a firearm, when they need to inform law enforcement and age requirements to carry were voted down by a majority of the committee. Some of the bills received bipartisan votes, and others were along party lines. 
The committee overwhelmingly voted 11-2 not to change the law that requires someone carrying a concealed weapon without a valid permit to inform law enforcement immediately during routine traffic stops, arrests or detainment. LD 1049 originally sought to repeal that requirement, but its sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan), amended her proposal during the work session so that an officer would have to ask first.
However, multiple committee members brought up other constitutional concerns, including potential violations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, which protect individuals against unlawful search and seizure and from self incrimination. Others said they couldn’t support the bill because the law was written to protect law enforcement, and some officers expressed concern about changes to the law. 
There was also bipartisan support to maintain current law that says an employer can’t prohibit an employee from storing a firearm in their vehicle if the employee has a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm, so long as the vehicle is locked and the firearm is stored out of sight. 
While Rep. Alicia Collins (R-Sidney) sought with LD 998 to remove the requirement that an employee have a valid concealed carry permit, the committee weighed the competing interests of property rights and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
Ultimately, the committee voted 10-3 against the proposal, with many members agreeing current law already did a sufficient job at balancing employer versus employee rights. 
While the majority also voted against legislation to update statutory language about carrying in state parks and lowering the age that someone can carry without a permit to 18, those proposals received party line votes. 
Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot) said during the public hearing that he introduced LD 829 to clean up confusion in existing law by making it clear that someone can carry a concealed firearm in a state park, so long as they are not otherwise prohibited from possessing one. 
Committee co-chair Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth) said she wasn’t going to support the proposal because the Legislature had previously considered that statute and didn’t see any reason why it should be changed. 
However, Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) said she backed the legislation because of what she saw as a need for protection against other people as well as animals in remote areas of state parks. 
Democrats similarly didn’t want to reduce the age limit that a person can carry without a permit, while Republicans were in favor of doing so. The committee voted 7-5 to reject LD 424. 
Current law requires someone who is 18 to 20 years old and without military training to have a permit to carry concealed. Someone can carry without a permit starting at age 21.
Rep. Dani O’Halloran (D-Brewer) pointed out that 18-year-olds are often still in high school, so she couldn’t justify taking away the training requirements for someone at that age to be able to carry a firearm. 
Henderson suggested an amendment, which her Republican colleagues supported, to add language clarifying that someone could carry concealed without a permit starting at age 18, except if they are still in high school. 
While Haggan said society has already decided someone is an adult at 18 and has given them other rights such as voting, Kuhn argued that people 18 to 20 can also be more impulsive and carrying a firearm can come with deadly consequences.

(Photo by Alex Goodlett for Utah News Dispatch)In the last five years, lawmakers have passed on average 40 bills during each 45-day legislative session that either create new criminal offenses or increase the penalty for existing crimes. 
It’s part of a trend that Utah Gov. Spencer Cox calls “unsustainable.” 
This year was no different, with lawmakers introducing 77, and passing 43, bills to either add, enhance or expand criminal penalties. There were just eight bills, six successful, that sought to narrow, reduce or repeal. 
Now, Utah has dozens of new laws and increased penalties in state code. It’s now a class B misdemeanor for a public employee to use public money for union activity; trafficking large quantities of fentanyl is now a standalone first-degree felony; obstructing traffic while failing to comply with law enforcement is now a class B misdemeanor.

That’s just a taste of the 43 bills that passed this session. A full list of these new bills is available here. 
And while all 43 were signed by Cox, the governor said the volume of changes to the state’s criminal code gives him pause. 
“I’m concerned about the strain this rapid growth in new offenses places on our incarceration resources. I’ve heard from many stakeholders — including law enforcement leaders — that the sheer volume of recent changes has become difficult to manage,” the governor said in his end-of-session letter to lawmakers. “There is also a valid question as to whether these enhancements, absent an overarching strategy, will actually achieve the public safety goals they’re intended to address.” 
To that end, Cox signed an executive order last week creating a new task force aimed at reviewing the state’s criminal justice policy. 
Announced late on Thursday night, the task force will be charged with evaluating “how current criminal justice laws and policies are serving the state — and developing a comprehensive framework — will improve criminal justice efforts in our state,” according to the executive order. 
The task force will consist of the following department heads, or someone they designate to serve in their place: 

The Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice 
The Utah Department of Public Safety 
The Utah Department of Corrections 
The Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget 
The chair of the Board of Pardons and Parole 
Any other state agency “deemed necessary to accomplish the Task Force’s responsibilities”

A member of the Utah House of Representatives and Senate will also be appointed to the task force. 
The task force will create a framework for the governor and lawmakers on the Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Interim Committee to review by October, which per Cox’s executive order, will consider 10 things: 

Public safety 
Deterrence 
Proportionality (meaning punishments should fit the crime) 
Judicial discretion and consistency 
Rehabilitation and treatment 
Recidivism 
Costs and resources 
Jail and prison capacity 
Victim needs 
Research and data

Then, Utah’s state agencies will use that framework to complete a report, which will be submitted to the committee, on how best to approach criminal justice policy in the state.  
Cox’s task force builds on a bill sponsored by Rep. Ryan Wilcox, R-Ogden, that requires state agencies to review criminal offenses that pertain to the department, then make recommendations to the legislature on what could be repealed or redefined. 
The bill, HB353, is one of the few pieces of legislation passed this year that actually repeals certain criminal offenses, some of which “haven’t been charged in over a decade,” Wilcox said during the session. 
It also moves a number of misdemeanor crimes to an infraction, the lowest criminal penalty in state code.  
Cox said he likes the bill. But it will be one of a handful this year that he allows to go into law without his signature, “not because I don’t like the bill, but because I think we can do even more,” he said. 
A ‘one-way ratchet’ 
During the session, Wilcox told lawmakers during a committee meeting he’s “hyper aware of that one-way ratchet” when it comes to criminal justice policy — meaning, each year lawmakers pass far more bills that create or increase criminal penalties than bills that repeal or reduce. 
So why does it matter? What’s wrong with holding criminals accountable? 
For people like Steve Burton, a defense attorney and director of the Utah Defense Attorney Association, it can sometimes strip the nuance from criminal justice policy. That’s the case particularly for bills that impose mandatory minimum sentences.

“They treat a lot of people the same,” Burton said, while costing taxpayers thousands of dollars more each year to incarcerate someone, regardless of how the state’s criminal justice policies might evolve. 
And generally speaking, a tough-on-crime approach is just an ineffective way to approach criminal justice, he said. For instance, making a misdemeanor crime a felony means the convicted will have a much harder time finding a job — and having steady employment is one of the main factors in reducing recidivism. 
Plus, keeping people incarcerated longer often increases their social ties with other criminals, another factor that increases recidivism. And, if the convicted person is a parent, that means they’ll be spending less time with their kids — statistically, that heightens the risk that their children will engage in criminal behavior.  
“When we think that we’re being tough on crime, we’re actually often increasing the risk of that person reoffending and creating more victims,” said Burton.  
Plus, harsher sentences can give prosecutors more power in what is supposed to be a balanced system. A harsher penalty means the person charged is more likely to plead guilty to minimize time spent in prison. It depends on the source, but typically just 2% to 5% of cases actually go to trial, with most cases either resulting in a guilty plea or a case being dismissed. 
“With the vast majority of cases being resolved through plea bargain, that means that the decision-making power is in the prosecutor’s hands as to what the ultimate penalty should be. And the more that you increase penalties, the more you incentivize defendants to not take their case to trial,” said Burton.

HB 166, sponsored by Rep. Leigh Hulsey, R-Helena, passed the chamber 79-15. It requires local school boards to adopt a policy to store student cell phones during class hours. Hulsey said during a floor debate on Thursday that the devices could be stored in a device like a Yondr Pouch or a shoe organizer.
“The majority of the schools already participating in this are storing the cell phones in the classroom in various ways,” Hulsey said.

Yondr Pouches are an expensive option compared to a $10 plastic over-the-door shoe organizer. Pike Road Junior High School Principal Christy Wright showed the Senate Education Policy Committee how the school implements a ban in February. The $30 Yondr Pouches at Pike Road were purchased with a grant.
According to the bill, cell phones can be stored in a locker, car or other storage device so long as the device is not on the student’s person. According to the Pew Research Center, 72% of U.S. high school teachers say that cellphone distraction is a major issue in their classrooms. 
Democratic representatives were concerned about how a student would access their phones in an emergency. Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, said that with school shootings a constant threat, a child should be able to contact their parents. According to the K-12 School Shooting Database, there were 332 school shootings in 2024. There have been 52 in 2025 so far. 
“We as a body need to protect our kids since we will not pass a bill to keep guns away from our school children,” Drummond said.
Drummond has sponsored bills over the last several years that would effectively require parents to safely store firearms at home. The bills would also have allowed parents to be charged with misdemeanors if a child brought an unsecured weapon to school. But the legislation has not moved. A House committee killed Drummond’s latest version of the bill in February. 
Rep. Napoleon Bracy, D-Prichard, brought up another potential event that could develop at school where a child may need to contact their parents. He said a student could need a change of clothes in the middle of the day.
“It’s not a situation where it’s life or death, it’s not like somebody is coming in for a school shooting,” he said. “I just think it’s overreaching.”
According to the bill, a student can have access to their phones under three exceptions: if they study under an Individualized Education Plan that allows it; for teacher-approved instruction and for medical purposes.
Hulsey claimed that there is data that shows that cell phone bans cause improved test scores, retained information and students’ mental health. Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said she would like to see that data.
“I’ve just not seen the preponderance of students playing games while the teacher is trying to teach, the room being disrupted and out of order,” she said. “I would just like to see that data at some point.”
Alabama Department of Mental Health Commissioner Kimberly Boswell said in February the mental health of students would improve under the ban. Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, echoed that and supported the legislation on the House floor Thursday.
“It’s going to make a difference,” Collins said.
The House approved an amendment that removed punishments on schools that do not comply. Hulsey said she wished that was still in the bill but would bring a bill in a few years after seeing compliance. There is a survey required in the legislation to monitor compliance.
“I haven’t passed a bill yet that I’ve loved every single thing about it,” Hulsey said. “All of it takes compromise to move the needle a little bit.”
Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Tuskegee, said that enforcement could be difficult without sanctions.
“We need to put some teeth into this bill,” Warren said. “If we don’t we’re going to be in the same position next year as we are this year.”
The legislation moves to the Senate. Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, has filed a companion bill in that chamber.

Or bills that impose harsher penalties, create new aggravating factors (which is when a judge can give a longer sentence based on the severity of a crime) and require mandatory minimum sentences — for instance, a law from Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, that increases the penalty for human trafficking for sexual exploitation, while imposing a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.
And there were bills that widened the scope of existing crimes — like Clearfield GOP Rep. Karianne Lisonbee’s bill to expand the definition of domestic violence in the presence of a child to include strangulation or choking. 
It’s part of a recent trend at Utah’s Capitol Hill. In the last five years, lawmakers have passed an average of 40 bills each session that add, increase or enhance criminal penalties — in that same timeframe, they averaged just six bills each session to repeal, decrease or narrow criminal penalties.  
According to the governor’s office, and the Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice, here’s a list of all 43 bills passed by lawmakers and signed by Cox. Many of them were signed last week by Cox, and have an effective date of May 7. 

HB13, Sexual Extortion Amendments widens the definition of sexual extortion to include “threatening to distribute a counterfeit intimate image,” which includes a computer-generated or manipulated image or video. 
HB19, Child Labor Amendments enhances the penalty for repeat child labor violations, starting with a class B misdemeanor for a first offense, a class A misdemeanor for a second offense, and a third-degree felony for three or more violations. 
HB22, Prostitution Offense Amendments imposes new penalties for people who solicit prostitution from a child, creates the crime of “entering or remaining in a place of prostitution” and creates new definitions in Utah code regarding sex work.
HB38, Criminal Offenses Modifications creates a new offense for recruiting minors to join a street gang, which could be a second- or first-degree felony if a weapon is used to intimidate; increases the metric used when determining loss in retail theft; increases the penalties and widens the scope of sexual extortion; and allows for increased penalties for theft-related crimes if the person was guilty of a similar offense in another state. 
HB53, Litter Cleanup Amendments makes throwing burning material on a highway (which was previously an infraction) a class C misdemeanor. 


HB66, Ritual Abuse Amendments creates an aggravating factor for child abuse committed as part of a ritual, defined as using “ceremonial objects, ceremonial clothing, religious texts, or specific words.” That means a judge can impose a harsher sentence if a perpetrator is found guilty. 
HB69, Government Records and Information Amendments prohibits a government officer from accessing certain voter information, making it a class B misdemeanor.
HB78, Criminal Offenses Amendments increases the penalty for people who knowingly commit aggravated child abuse, raising it from a second-degree felony to a first-degree felony. It also restricts a court from granting probation or a suspended sentence to people guilty of violent crimes like murder, kidnapping or rape, with some exceptions. 
HB80, Disorderly Conduct Amendments creates a criminal offense called aggravated disorderly conduct on a street or highway, defined as intentionally blocking traffic on a road with a speed limit of at least 40 miles per hour. It’s a class B misdemeanor on first offense and class A misdemeanor for a second offense.
HB87, Drug Trafficking Amendments creates a new criminal offense for trafficking fentanyl or a fentanyl-related substance. If someone is caught with more than 100 grams of fentanyl, they could be charged with a first-degree felony, with no option for probation or a suspended sentence.
HB96, Fraud Amendments changes the scope of defrauding a creditor. If the unpaid balance is less than $10,000, it would be a class A misdemeanor; if it’s more than $10,000, it can be enhanced to a third-degree felony. 
HB105, Criminal Code Modifications makes attempted murder a first-degree felony with a minimum prison term of five years, increases the penalty for a teacher who has a sexual relationship with an adult student to a third-degree felony, and creates a crime called indecent exposure of another individual in public, a class C or B misdemeanor depending on the severity, and a class A misdemeanor if done in front of a child.  
HB127, Sexual Crime Amendments increases the prison term for sex crimes like rape and forcible sodomy from a minimum of five years to 10 years if the victim is an “incapacitated individual,” which typically means they have some kind of intellectual disability. 
HB128, Dangerous Weapon at a School Amendments applies the crime of possessing a dangerous weapon on school premises to a minor. 
HB148, Child Sexual Abuse Amendments creates an aggravating factor for sex crimes involving children if the perpetrator traveled more than 45 miles from their residence, or paid a child to travel more than 45 miles. An aggravating factor means a judge can impose a harsher sentence. 
HB183, Noncitizen Restricted Person Amendments makes an immigrant with a pending application for asylum or temporary protected status a restricted person, meaning they cannot purchase or own a firearm. If they do, they could be charged with a second-degree felony. 
HB190, Motorcycle Amendments prohibits motorcyclists from lane splitting (which is when a motorcycle rides between two lanes while traffic is moving) and performing a wheelie on a highway, which could now result in a suspended license. 
HB196, Vehicle Traction Amendments creates a traffic infraction for drivers who fail to use specific traction equipment, like snow tires, if required by the Utah Department of Transportation. 
HB197, Criminal Conduct Amendments widens the crime of enticement of a minor to include all communications with the intent to entice, not just communications with the minor. That means communications with the minor’s parents, with the intent to entice, would be criminal. 
HB199, Substance Use Treatment and Enforcement Amendments touches on a number of issues regarding substance use, including a new offense targeting people who rent buildings for the purpose of drug activity, called maintenance of a drug-involved premises, a second-degree felony. 
HB207, Sexual Offense Revisions imposes a mandatory minimum sentencing increase of five years each time a person is convicted of a second- or third-degree felony sexual offense; widens the scope of sexual exploitation of a minor to include accessing child sexual abuse material (sometimes referred to as child pornography) with the intent to view; and increases the penalty for aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor 14 years old or older from a second-degree felony to a first-degree felony. 
HB226, Criminal Amendments makes the maximum sentence for a violent class A misdemeanor 365 days, an increase of one day. Per federal law, a one-year prison or jail sentence automatically initiates deportation proceedings for someone who is not a U.S. citizen, and the bill is intended to facilitate the federal push for more deportations. 
HB267, Public Sector Labor Union Amendments imposes a class B misdemeanor on public employees who use taxpayer funds for union activity. 
HB290, Bicycle Lane Safety Amendments creates an infraction for drivers who obstruct or drive on bike lanes or sidewalks. 
HB312, Criminal Justice Amendments makes a number of procedural changes for jails, including redefining “habitual offender” and preventing the release of people convicted of drug and violence-related crimes. It also widens the scope of domestic violence in the presence of a child to include strangulation or choking. 
HB358, Criminal Sexual Conduct Amendments creates a crime called unlawful sexual activity with a child using virtual reality, a third-degree felony, where an adult sexually targets an avatar or video game character that they know belongs to a minor. If the perpetrator is less than 10 years older than the child, it’s a third-degree felony. 
HB405, Human Trafficking Amendments increases the penalty for human trafficking for sexual exploitation, moving it from a second-degree felony to a first-degree felony. It also imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years; if the child victim is less than 14 years old, the minimum sentence is 15 years. 
HB430, Security and Land Restriction Amendments targets foreign espionage in Utah, specifically on and around military bases, and creates a third-degree felony for anyone who buys land on behalf of a restricted foreign entity (which includes Russia, Iran, China and North Korea). 
HB478, Brine Mining Amendments creates a class B misdemeanor for anyone who makes a false statement or report related to the Brine Conservation Act, which deals with the drilling and production of lithium, magnesium, bromine and other minerals extracted from salt water. 
HB505, Homeless Services Revisions creates a class C misdemeanor for unsanctioned camping on state property. 
SB24, Child Abuse and Torture Amendments creates a new crime called child torture for the most extreme cases of child abuse, a third-degree felony that, with some exceptions, would be punishable by a 10-year minimum sentence. 
SB55, Unauthorized Use of Residential Real Property Amendments targets illegal squatting, creating a second-degree felony for trespassers who cause more than $1,000 in damage; and a second-degree felony for people who falsely advertise, rent or sell a residential property that isn’t theirs. 
SB68, Child Welfare Worker Protections separates the crime of assault or threat of violence against a child welfare worker into two sections; and makes assaulting or threatening the family of a child welfare worker a class A misdemeanor.   
SB77, Police Service Animal Amendments expands the current criminal code regarding police canines to include all public safety animals. 
SB82, Autopsy Photo Amendments creates a class B misdemeanor for anyone who receives a non-public autopsy photograph of a deceased person and shares it. 
SB90, Mandatory Jail Sentence Amendments requires a judge to impose a mandatory jail or prison sentence for crimes committed by a person who has already been deported, then charged with felony reentry to the U.S.
SB144, Sexual Crimes Amendments widens the definition of child sexual abuse material; expands the crime of sexual exploitation of a minor to include accessing child sexual abuse material “with the intent to view”; and makes aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor over 14 years old a first-degree felony, eliminating a carveout that imposed a lesser, second-degree felony if the victim was a teenager. 
SB149, Natural Resources Modifications makes a number of changes to Utah code regarding hunting on public land, including creating a class B misdemeanor for operating as a hunting guide without first registering with the state; and a class B misdemeanor for knowingly retaining a guide who isn’t registered. 
SB170, School Discipline Amendments prohibits corporal punishment and seclusion in schools. School employees who violate the law could be charged with unlawful detention or unlawful detention of a minor, a class B misdemeanor. 
SB195, Transportation Amendments is an omnibus transportation bill that, among other things, expands the scope of certain bicycle-related infractions regarding speed, reckless operation and night usage to include electric unicycles and electric personal assistive mobility devices (often used by people who have difficulty walking or a disability). 
SB215, Emergency Medical Services Modifications makes it a class B misdemeanor to willfully disobey a cease and desist letter or subpoena from the Utah Bureau of Emergency Medical Services. 
SB336, Utah Fairpark Area Investment and Restoration District Modifications imposes a class B misdemeanor on any member of the Utah Fairpark Area Investment and Restoration District Board (which governs the area where lawmakers hope to soon see a Major League Baseball stadium) who fails to submit a disclosure statement.

Photo by Stephen Ausmus/Agricultural Research Service, USDA.For Minnesota legislators looking for ways to protect workers, an unlikely source has provided an important blueprint. 
Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson is establishing a Joint Labor Task Force that will prioritize investigating corporate conduct that harms workers. In announcing the task force Ferguson wrote that “deceptive, unfair, and anticompetitive labor practices are widespread” and identifies a range of harmful practices, including noncompete agreements, wage-fixing agreements and the abuse of consolidated power.
While an antitrust agency might not seem the obvious place for labor policy, the unchecked rise of monopoly power is a significant threat to workers. Ferguson’s announcement continues the approach of his predecessor, Lina Khan, and other Biden administration regulators. That approach is not new, as the architects of our antitrust laws understood the threat monopolies pose to workers. Sen. John Sherman, author of the Sherman Antitrust Act, said in 1892 that a monopoly “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes, for in its field it allows no competitors.”
That statement rings true today. The average local labor market in the U.S. is considered highly concentrated by federal antitrust guidelines, and one out of every eight labor markets is dominated by a single employer. The result of that, according to a 2022 study by the Treasury Department, is that the average worker earns roughly 20% less than they would if there was more competition.
In 2023 Minnesota took a step in addressing that issue by requiring the impacts on health care workers to be considered when evaluating large health care mergers. Legislators could build on that law by requiring labor market analysis as part of merger review across the economy. States across the country have proposed requiring more pre-merger notification and labor market analysis could be made a part of such a proposal. Legislators could also pass the Fair Competition Act, which would make it clear that the abuse of monopsony power — when big players use their power to push down prices from suppliers and labor — is a violation of Minnesota’s antitrust law.
A recent $180 million wage-fixing settlement among the largest firms in the poultry industry shows another consequence of unchecked monopoly power. Companies not only gain greater power over workers but can also more easily collude with those firms that remain. In an economy that has grown 50% more consolidated since 2005, this behavior is likely to increase. 
Unfortunately, a 2007 Supreme Court decision has made it more difficult to bring price and wage-fixing cases. Legislators could ease enforcement by amending Minnesota law to shift the burden onto defendants instead of requiring plaintiffs to provide explicit evidence of price-fixing before further facts can be obtained through discovery. 
Traditional wage-fixing is just the tip of the iceberg. A recent report on surveillance prices and wages demonstrates how detailed data collection to feed algorithms and artificial intelligence will make it even easier for companies to conspire against workers and drive down wages. One approach to this emerging challenge is to prohibit algorithmic price and wage-fixing, which some legislators are seeking to do in the rental industry. The use of third-party analytics companies to fix prices and wages is not confined to housing, however. Legislators could draw on a federal proposal, Senator Amy Klobuchar’s Preventing Algorithmic Collusion Act, for a way to prohibit tacit collusion against workers across Minnesota’s economy.  
In addition to the impact on wages and jobs, anticompetitive conduct is transforming the basics of what a worker really is. Consider a proposal to allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize. The underlying reason such legislation is necessary is because ridesharing platforms misclassify their workers as independent contractors and then exert control using anticompetitive “vertical restraints,” which are contracts governing buyer-seller relationships.
This business model would have been a clear violation of antitrust laws before a multi-decade effort to weaken enforcement against anticompetitive vertical restraints. Now gig companies and others are able to maintain a system of “control without responsibility” — firms can tightly manage individuals while avoiding the legal and financial responsibilities of formal employment. Uber controls the routes and rates supposedly independent drivers receive while the “independent” trucking companies Amazon uses must deliver packages exclusively for Amazon in vehicles branded by Amazon, and using routes, rates and schedules dictated by Amazon.
Minnesota took steps to limit vertical restraints by banning non compete clauses and no-poach agreements in 2023. But lawmakers could build off that work by strengthening the state’s antitrust laws to more clearly prohibit the use of other anticompetitive and coercive contracts that exploit workers and limit freedom and mobility. 
For too long the concept of what constitutes labor policy has been narrowly confined to issues like minimum wage rates and right-to-work laws, but our antimonopoly tools are an important part of keeping workers from suffering under the thumb of monopolists.

Joe Lombardo describing Lombardo's housing legislation in Las Vegas Tuesday. (Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)State lawmakers question if President Donald Trump’s world-roiling tariffs will undercut Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo housing bill, which allocates $250 million in funding to build more housing and expands the definition of affordable housing to include higher incomes. 
Lombardo has previously focused his attention on addressing the state’s housing crisis by calling on the federal government to release more federal land he argues is needed to build more housing – even as housing groups warn against urban sprawl and a local analysis shows significant infill land available.
Assembly Bill 540, heard Wednesday night by the Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee, seeks to use state general funds to help finance the development of housing. 
The bill also expands the threshold of affordable housing to include households making 150% of area median income and allows out-of-state contractors to develop in rural areas, which is currently prohibited by state law. 
Lombardo, appearing briefly before the panel Wednesday to introduce the bill, said the legislation “expedites permanent housing solutions” and described his bill as the “action plan to get this done so that significant progress is already underway in Nevada before land is even released.”
Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, citing the tariffs Trump announced on all imports from all countries Wednesday that sent financial markets into a severe tailspin Thursday, said Lombardo’s bill doesn’t match the times.
The National Association of Homebuilders, Yeager added, anticipates tariffs will drive up the cost of all housing and construction costs.
“I do think there is a twinge of irony that we as a state are asking the federal government to give us land to be able to build but at the same time we are seeing federal policies that maybe prevent us from building on that land that’s being released,” Yeager said. “I don’t know if this is the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.”
Yeager asked if Lombardo’s office had talked with Trump about the newly announced sweeping tariffs, and how their economic fallout could impede the state from building more housing.
Ryan Cherry, the governor’s chief of staff, said while the office has talked with the Trump administration about housing costs, “as far as tariffs, we have not had direct conversations as of this time.”  
Asked earlier in the week, before the scope and scale of Trump’s tariff proposals announced Wednesday were known, about the impacts of tariffs and Trump’s other economic policies, Lombardo said Nevada will “make adjustments on the fly.”
Nevada Housing Division Administrator Steve Aichroth, who helped present the bill on Wednesday, noted the state has already had to weather high interest rights and supply chain issues in the last few years. 
Despite how Covid exacerbated the housing crisis, the state still tried to find a way to build, Aichroth said. 
While everyone would prefer to “build in a perfect environment,” Aichroth said, “we haven’t seen a perfect environment in a long time. But we have to build. We have to get projects built and on the ground.”   
The American Rescue Plan Act, passed and signed into law in 2021 by President Joe Biden, allocated billions of dollars of relief funds to the state. 
The state directed $500 million of that assistance to the Home Means Nevada fund, which offered financing for housing projects throughout the state and helped prevent building from being stalled, Aichroth said.  
“Whether it’s tariffs or higher interest rates, any of those challenges we hear from builders and laborers, all of those factor into the current housing eco-system,” he said. “There is never a perfect time to do this. We have to play the cards we are dealt.”
AB 540 would change the definition of affordable housing to “attainable housing,” creating the Nevada Attainable Housing Fund and Council, which will oversee the allocation of $250 million in funding for housing projects. 
Christine Hess, the chief financial officer of the Nevada Housing Division, said that $50 million of the funds will be directed toward “loans and will remain assets of the division’s trust so that we can continue to issue the hundreds of millions of bonds annually for home ownership and multi-family rental housing.”
Hess said while financing building for buyers with more than 150% of area household median income — more than $120,000 a year in Nevada —  “sounds like a lot,” it was designed to meet the changing landscape of the cost of housing. 
“The median home price up and up in Reno is $600,000,” she said. “The idea was that up to 150% gives the division with input from the communities and stakeholders, to be flexible, and the amount of public funding.” 
Aichroth added the state has “programs that basically focus on 60% and 80% and below.”
Though there are other resources for lower income earners, the need is far greater. 
There are only 17 available homes for every 100 extremely low income households making less than 30% of AMI compared to 94 available homes per 100 renter households making 100% of AMI, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
Democratic Assemblymember Brittney Miller asked how projects would be prioritized. 
Aichroth said it would be a combination of community need and financial feasibility.
He added the feasibility piece was extremely important “to ensure that the projects can get built, built to fruition, and house people for a good length of time.”
Real estate interests and homebuilding firms supported the bill, saying it would alleviate issues faced when it comes to developing more housing. 
Val Thomason, with the Democratic Socialists of America, said the bill “seems like a giveaway to property developers.” 
 No prevailing wage requirements 
Lawmakers asked little about expanding households to include 150% AMI and changing the definition of affordable housing to attainable, and how that portion of the measure might come at the expense of lower income households.  
Instead they directed much of their focus on the section of the bill that exempts projects from paying prevailing wages to construction workers that state law typically requires of publicly financed projects. 
Under Lombardo’s bill, builders needn’t pay prevailing wage if “the qualified borrower demonstrates that the qualified project addresses a need for critical infrastructure in an area with a shortage of attainable housing.”
Tina Frias, the CEO of the Southern Nevada Homebuilders Association argued that state prevailing wage requirements “make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for home builders to construct attainable homes.”
“We’re willing to sacrifice construction workers,” said Las Vegas Democratic Assemblymember Max Carter, admonishing the provision. The state is “willing to let them work for substandard wages. In fact, incentivize them working for substandard wages.” 
Reno Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth pointed to two housing projects that received funding from the Nevada Infrastructure Bank.
“Both of those projects use prevailing wages and both of those projects didn’t have trouble securing financing or penciling out,” she said. 
Despite the bill’s language exempting the prevailing wage, Cherry said it was not the intent “to be presented this way.”
“I will be clear and on the record for this committee that Governor Lombardo does support the use of prevailing wage on projects across the board,” he said. 
Labor groups, including the AFL-CIO, and progressive groups, including Battle Born Progress, also opposed the bill’s provisions prevailing wage exemption.

He shared a photo of signing Senate Bill 43 into law, pictured by himself at his desk in his Juneau office, with the Alaska and U.S. flags on either side.
Bill sponsor Sen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage, celebrated the occasion. 
“Women’s history in Alaska is not only about past achievements but is also a way to honor the current and future contributions of women in Alaska,” Gray-Jackson said in a written statement Thursday. “This bill is aimed to encourage our Alaskan communities to honor the contributions of women who have helped paved the way throughout our state’s rich history.”
Gray-Jackson thanked legislators for supporting the legislation, including Rep. Carolyn Hall, D-Achorage, who carried the bill in the House. “Together, we will continue to inspire the future generations of Alaskan women,” she said. 
This year, the Alaska Legislature has a historic number of women representing districts across the state, with the first majority of women serving in the Alaska House of Representatives  – also recognized in a letter of support for the bill by former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, the first woman to represent Alaska in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“It would be fitting for this legislation to be passed by our 34th Legislature, where we have a record number of women serving our state,” she wrote, acknowledging several trailblazing female leaders of Alaska, including Alaska’s first female U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski and Peltola served alongside each other in the Alaska House from 1999 to 2002.
“By recognizing Women’s History Month, we make it clear to women, especially young women and girls that they should not be afraid to be the bold leaders Alaska needs to guide us into the future,” Peltola said. “We also honor the trailblazers that came before us, displayed remarkable leadership, and now serve as role models for our generation and the next.”
Next year will be the first March that the law will be in  effect.

Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, speaks to a colleague on the floor of the Alabama Senate on April 3, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)​​The Alabama Senate Thursday passed a bill expanding the pool of people who can claim a religious exemption from vaccines and allowing them to do so without explanation.
SB 85, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, extends the existing religious exemption requirements from parents of K-12 students to college students. It also would not require either to provide or explain the reason for the exception or have it certified or approved by local school boards. The legislation also mandates that public colleges and universities provide both religious and medical exemptions if they require students to be vaccinated or tested for diseases. The bill passed 26-5.
Orr said during the floor debate the current system creates unnecessary hurdles and potential costs for parents exercising their religious beliefs, saying that roughly half the states allow a similar exemption process.
“It’s not a discretionary function. It is a mandatory function that they have to give you the religious exemption paper. So, why are we doing that? Let’s just let parents affirm that they have a religious exemption,” Orr said to reporters after the Senate adjourned.

Several Democrats raised concerns about public health and the potential spread of disease. The state’s measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination rate fell below 94% in 2022-23. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 95% of the population needs to be immunized to achieve herd immunity.
Sen. Robert Stewart, D-Selma, said that the state has historically “worked hard as a state, as a country, to have strong, robust infection control. He said that “when we talk about religious freedom, we have a duty to keep our communities safe.”
“Public health is a community project, and we should all work together to ensure that our communities are healthy, are viable,” Steward said.
Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, proposed an amendment requiring a person claiming a vaccine exemption to submit a board-approved physical evaluation form or the Alabama High School Athletic Association’s Preparticipation Physical Education form. The amendment does not provide an enforcement mechanism or sanctions for not submitting the form. The amendment was approved 21-7, 
“At least it gives us an understanding that this child has had some medical attention within the last 12 months prior to them opting out of this particular vaccine,” Singleton said. “If they don’t want to take it to go to school, at least the school now you’re bypassing the health department.” 
But Sen. Tim Melson, R-Florence, wanted the bill to go further and questioned the focus solely on religious exemptions.
“Why do you have to have a… religious exemption? Why can’t it just be a conscientious objection? What are the agnostic people going to do? What are the atheists going to do if they don’t want to do it?” Melson asked Orr.
Orr said that he “would agree” but that he doesn’t think that providing conscientious exemption to vaccines, often referred to as a personal exemption, would pass either chamber.
“It would be more of an uphill challenge than it already is,” Orr said. “So I would love to do that if I were king for a day, but I’m not king.”
Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Birmingham, said she was concerned about removing the Alabama Department of Public Health’s role in tracking exemptions. She said that when there may be outbreaks, health departments will be less equipped to trace a potential virus.
“My fear is when we don’t leave it there at the health department, then we’ll never be able to find out where patient zero is and if there is some type of outbreak, how to be able to bring it under control,” Coleman said.  
A similar version of the bill passed the Senate last year but failed in the House.

A bill before state lawmakers seeks to increase Medicaid funding for patients treated at university clinics in Nevada, and help alleviate the mental health provider shortage in the process, supporters say.   
“I know that we are serious about improving access to mental health care in Nevada, and we must be equally serious about how we train and sustain the professionals who provide it,”  Dr. Michelle Paul, executive director of UNLV Partnership for Research, Assessment, Counseling, Therapy and Innovative Clinical Education (PRACTICE) told lawmakers last week. “I won’t overemphasize the point. I think everyone knows Nevada ranks among the lowest in the nation for access to quality mental health care. We’re last for child mental health and the current workforce supply cannot meet the demand.”
University-based training clinics play a critical role in trying to fill in the gap, Paul said. “We provide high-quality evidence-based care directly to community members, while also providing the training necessary. But we do so on limited funding.”
Currently, a graduate student who works with a child and family for one hour is reimbursed by Medicaid for that hour. 
“But beyond that hour, they had an hour of supervision. They had an hour of how to assess suicide risk,” Paul said, explaining the current reimbursement scheme “doesn’t help us provide the infrastructure and support behind quality training. Clinics already serve Medicaid recipients, but are financially unsustainable under fee for service rates.” 
Senate Bill 353 creates a category for university clinics that provide counseling services to the public. The legislation creates two per diem reimbursement rates – one for psychiatric residents, and another for non-medical trainees such as marriage and family therapist graduate students.
The rates are in line with research from Washington state, which is also seeking to establish a reimbursement model for university training clinics.   
The proposed reimbursement model would require $255,103 from the state in the next biennium, which begins July 1, in addition to $417,340 from federal Medicaid funding over the two years. 
Enhanced reimbursement rates have existed for decades for medical education, Paul told lawmakers.
The legislation would allow clinics to leverage their services “in a smart, scalable way,” Paul said, adding the effort “represents more than a technical adjustment to reimbursement policy. It is an innovative and vital step toward building the workforce we need while ensuring access to quality care for the most vulnerable.”
“Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health services in the United States, and remains a critical pathway to accessing health care,” state Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop, a Democrat from Las Vegas and one of the bill’s sponsors, testified last week before the Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor. “Access to mental and behavioral health services for Medicaid enrollees is a fundamental aspect of the mission of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ensuring that all individuals have access to receive necessary support for their overall well being.”
UNLV PRACTICE has an annual budget of $675,000, and provides 6,500 hours of mental health services a year while training 30 graduate students, Paul said. 
The clinic has served more than 6,000 community members and trained 300 graduates since 2012, said Dondero-Loop, who is sponsoring the legislation along with Sen. Edgar Flores and Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, also Democrats from Southern Nevada. 
The clinic’s patients have a 67.5% overall improvement rate, compared to 21% in routine care settings, Paul said via email. 
“Our clinics reach hard to serve populations,” Paul testified, adding UNLV PRACTICE provides telehealth services to middle and high school students in Elko and Humboldt counties. “We also see children and Spanish-speaking families and individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the standard reimbursement fails to account for the additional supervision, infrastructure and time needed in training clinics.”

(Courtesy of New Jersey Governor's Office)State officials say they are reviewing a new letter from the Trump administration threatening to pull federal education funding if all schools have not eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
In the Thursday letter, the federal Department of Education told state education commissioners that they must certify that all K-12 schools are not engaging in any programs to “advantage one’s race over another.” The use of DEI initiatives could violate federal law, the Department of Education says.
Spokespeople for Gov. Phil Murphy and the state Department of Education say they are mulling what the state should do next.
“We are aware of the U.S. Department of Education’s letter to the New Jersey Department of Education, and we are evaluating the state’s options,” said Murphy spokeswoman Maggie Garbarino.
State Department of Education spokeswoman Laura Fredrick, meanwhile, said the department is “reviewing this latest communication to determine appropriate next steps.”
The federal Department of Education sends more than $1 billion annually to New Jersey K-12 schools.
New Jersey has thousands of schools in nearly 600 school districts. The Trump administration letter directed states to collect certifications of compliance from all school districts within 10 days and return them to the feds. The certifications note that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows the federal government to withhold folding from districts that engage in racial discrimination.
Craig Trainor, the federal Department of Education’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement that “federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right.”
“When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal antidiscrimination requirements. Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI,” Trainor said.
President Donald Trump campaigned for the White House on a pledge to eradicate all public and private DEI initiatives.
New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin vowed to fight any attempt to “take away this critical funding.” Platkin’s office has filed numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, targeting everything from Trump’s executive order on voting restrictions to his administration’s attempt to cut $600 million in teacher training grants.
“Threatening federal funding for our schools, and especially our low-income and special needs students, is cruel and reckless,” he posted on social media.
Appearing at Montclair State University last month, Platkin defended DEI initiatives.
“Remember, DEI stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Diversity, equity, and inclusion alright? This is not radical stuff. This is not indoctrinating everyone. It’s saying everyone gets treated fairly. By the way, that’s also what state and federal law says,” he said.
Federal officials warned states in February that funds would be rescinded in schools using DEI in admissions, hiring, scholarships, and other aspects of student life.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Medicaid-work.jpg,,,2025-04-04 11:09:16.864129

Bob Ferguson will hash out in the final weeks of the legislative session.
Washington’s wealthiest individuals, largest corporations and biggest banks are prime targets. Homeowners, vapers and self-storage unit renters are among those who could share in the burden. Possible tweaks to expand the state’s capital gains tax could also be in play. 
“There will be a tax increase,” House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said Wednesday. “It’s figuring out the right kind of balance and making sure we’re able to not harm everyday Washingtonians.”
A day earlier, Ferguson threw cold water on House and Senate Democrats’ desire to tax those with more than $50 million. He said the tax is “untested, difficult to implement, and most importantly, for purposes of adopting a sustainable budget, will face an immediate challenge in court.” 
Ferguson said he could, however, tolerate such a tax if the take is tiny, just to have its legality tested. But a drastically slimmed version of the so-called wealth tax won’t raise anywhere near what Democrats say is necessary to close a wide budget gap and stave off harsh cuts.
Notably, Ferguson did not express dissent on other revenue-raising measures under discussion, such as hiking taxes on large businesses and financial institutions, a new payroll tax and lifting the 1% cap on annual increases in property tax collections by the state. 
These are all means Democrats are eyeing to fill a budget hole the governor pegged at $16 billion.
Republican legislators were glad the governor dissed the wealth tax but disappointed he didn’t go further.
“I wish he had also pushed back against the Democrats’ property-tax increase, as that will take billions upon billions from families of all income levels — but maybe it will be next,” Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, said in a statement.
Staking out their positions
Fans and foes of the Democrats’ efforts argued their cases at lengthy hearings in the Senate and House this week. They’ve also intensified their direct lobbying of party leaders and budget writers, knowing it’s crunch time. 
Leaders of Washington’s most-recognized corporate giants signed onto a letter Wednesday opposing new business-related taxes and warning of severe economic consequences if companies and jobs start decamping to less expensive states.
“Given national economic trends, Washington state cannot sustain continued tax and spending increases and simultaneously maintain our economic resilience and competitiveness,” reads the letter sent Wednesday to Ferguson and leaders of the four caucuses.
More than 60 executives — including those from Amazon, Costco, Microsoft, Nordstrom, T-Mobile, the Seattle Mariners and Weyerhaeuser — signed on.
Rachel Smith, president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, which helped put together the letter, said Thursday that political leaders at all levels of government need “a reality check” or they’re risking a recession.
“Whether you want to tax the rich to be righteous or enact tariffs to drive an ideological policy goal, we need to ask ourselves: when has kamikaze economic policy ever worked?” she said.  
Jinkins took umbrage at Weyerhaeuser’s participation, telling reporters company representatives have sat in her office and told her “we’re never leaving this state.”
Supporters have focused on the importance of Democrats’ proposals as a needed corrective to a tax system in which those with lower incomes pay a greater percentage of their earnings in taxes. 
The tax hikes will sustain vital services and move the state closer to carrying out its paramount duty of funding basic education for public school students, they’ve said.
“The governor and legislative leaders have all said that our tax structure is too regressive. Now is the time to help us close this budget shortfall while preserving public schools and essential services for our community,” said Larry Delaney, president of the Washington Education Association, a teachers’ union.
The big taxes
Democrats in the Senate and House have teed up four major proposals. Hearings were held this week on all of them, but no votes are planned until Democrats decide which to pursue.
One is the wealth tax targeting about 4,300 people. Each chamber has its own approach.
In the House version, there would be a tax of $8 on every $1,000 of assessed value of certain financial assets such as stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds. The tax would only apply to the value of these assets that is above $50 million. 
Senate Democrats want to set the tax rate at $10. They also want to tax the full value of the covered assets if a person has more than $50 million of them. In other words, if you have $51 million of these assets, Senate Democrats would apply the new tax on all of it, while the House would only tax the $1 million.
Both chambers want to erase the 1% cap on increases in the annual property tax growth for the state’s common schools levy and for cities and counties, as well as special purpose districts.
The Senate replaces it with one based on the combined rate of population growth plus inflation. There would be no cap. The House also moves to a rate based on population growth plus inflation, but sets a cap of 3%. Both assume the state property tax limit will be uncapped but local governments would not make a change without voter approval.
A third major proposal is a Senate-backed statewide payroll tax. Employers would pay a 5% tax on payroll expenses above the Social Security threshold — currently $176,100 per year. This tax is limited to companies with $7 million or more in payroll expenses — about 5,289 businesses. It’s modeled on Seattle’s JumpStart tax. Critics point to employers who have shifted jobs away from Seattle after the city imposed its levy.
House Democrats are eyeing a permanent 1% surcharge to the business and occupation tax rate on businesses with taxable income over $250 million. About 370 businesses would be affected. The same bill would increase the surcharge on financial institutions with annual net income of $1 billion or more from 1.2% to 1.9%. This will impact about 250 businesses.
Wait, there’s more
Budgets passed in the House and Senate relied on billions of dollars from the wealth tax to balance. Ferguson’s comments have them casting around for other ideas.
“There are other revenue options out there,” Jinkins said Wednesday, including eight to 10 business tax possibilities. 
“There are capital gains,” she added without elaborating. Washington imposes a 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests. Democrats in December looked at the possibility of upping it to 9% or having a higher rate for gains greater than $1 million.
The Senate has a bill to repeal 20 tax exemptions considered obsolete or ineffective. These include carve-outs for gold bullion and prescription drug wholesalers. 
This week, the House Finance Committee is expected to advance a bill expanding definitions of “moist snuff” and “tobacco products” to include those containing nicotine. That would make them subject to the state’s tobacco products tax and net $25 million a year. Next week the committee will consider a bill that could raise the price of cigarettes and vape products.
Bills to tax storage units, which could generate a similar amount each year, and increasing the advanced computing surcharge paid by large technology companies, are lurking. The latter legislation could bring in around $200 million a year.
“It’s clear we have work to do in negotiating a compromise that leads to a budget and revenue package that works for Washington families,” said House Finance Chair April Berg, D-Mill Creek.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The state prisons board on Thursday approved sending out a request for general contractors to submit proposals to build a new prison in Franklin County.
According to documents provided to the board, the Department of Corrections will begin advertising the request on April 8, with a deadline for submitting proposals on April 22. 
The department is aiming to receive approval from the Division of Building Authority in June. Also in June, the department plans to bring the project to the Arkansas Legislative Council for review.
Early sitework is proposed to start in September, with the start of construction for the planned 3,000-bed prison in January 2026. 
The board also voted to appoint an executive committee to review the proposals and oversee the overall design process for the prison.
The executive committee will have “approval and decision-making authority” in the interest of making decisions about the proposed prison “expeditiously,” according to documents provided by the board.
“These decisions will not carry cost impacts until we have designed to the approved budget,” a document about the committee read. Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion said committee members would be selected later.
Arkansas Senate rejects prison appropriation bill for second time

The committee will submit the designs for each design phase to the Board of Corrections for approval. Once the budget is finalized, any changes that would impact the cost by more than $250,000 would require additional approval from the board, something that board chair Benny Magness expressed satisfaction with.
“That’s more than adequate to me,” Magness told officials from Vanir Construction Management Inc., which the board retained to oversee the firm selected to build the prison.
The board did not spend long discussing the prison, but briefly talked about utilities — specifically, how drinking water and wastewater service would be established for the prison, which is proposed for a rural part of Franklin County. Opponents of the prison site have criticized its selection for a lack of adequate infrastructure.
Vanir officials discussed potentially building pipelines to bring in drinking water from Fort Smith; a wastewater pipeline is receiving similar consideration. Meetings with the city of Fort Smith about the matter would be happening on Friday, said Mike Beaber, the regional director for Vanir. Being able to pipe wastewater to Fort Smith instead of building a treatment facility on-site would allow builders to “put that money back into” the prison.
“Nothing is off the table,” Beaber said.
A $750 million appropriation bill needed to fund the prison’s construction failed to pass the state Senate for the third consecutive day Thursday.
In addition to the Franklin County prison, the board also raised the budget of a bed expansion at a work-release unit in Mississippi County by $4 million, which brought it up to $6.3 million. It had originally approved a $2.3 million budget in 2022, but multiple changes in the design have led to delays. The original budget called for adding 50 beds; the project now calls for 100 beds.
“We’ve still done nothing?” Magness asked. A department official confirmed that was the case.
Now, the estimated cost of the planned expansion is $5.6 million.

Session deadlines — including for the next two-year budget — also approach.,"House Speaker Todd Huston (left) and Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray answer reporter questions in scrums held Thursday, April 27, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s property taxes will return to the spotlight next week, with key lawmakers refining their message Thursday. And deadlines — including for the next two-year budget — are coming up as the end of the legislative session approaches.
Both House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray told reporters last month that they wanted Hoosiers’ 2026 property tax bills to be less than their 2025 property tax bills. But how much less?
They got more specific with reporters on Thursday, after behind-the-scenes negotiations with each others’ chambers and with Gov. Mike Braun.
“My goal is to have over 50% of people pay less in ‘26 than they did in ‘25,” Huston said. “I think it’s coming together, and we’re working at it.”
Bray similarly said that “most people” would pay less.
Major details
Huston outlined an ambitious target: he said homesteads — or primary residences — would see a “90-plus percent reduction” in “what people would have been paying in taxes.” Spokeswoman Molly Gillaspie later clarified he meant that over 90% of Hoosiers would pay less in property taxes next year.

Huston added that lawmakers would provide more than $1 billion in relief for property taxpayers over the next three years.
Bray said the Senate hoped to “help the people that need it most,” like those with fixed incomes.
His chamber originated the property tax plan in Senate Bill 1. The House will unveil its take on the legislation Monday at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing.
Braun has previously threatened to veto Senate Bill 1 if it doesn’t provide enough relief.
Asked if he was concerned the governor wouldn’t be satisfied with lawmakers’ efforts, Bray replied, “We’re hopeful that he’ll see real value in where we’re at, but we all have a position we have to stake out.”
More to come
Huston also signaled that a contentious bill forcing some public school districts to share property tax revenue with charter schools may be folded into the property tax plan. He said the merge “would make sense to me.”
In addition to major work on property taxes, the Senate must act this week on the state budget. The two-year, $46 billion spending plan in House Bill 1001 must get out of committee by Thursday, April 10 to meet a key session deadline.
Republicans control the House, Senate and governor’s office, so the trifecta’s goals for the budget are generally aligned.
Some larger issues involve funding for traditional K-12 public schools; increased spending on private and charter schools; Medicaid cuts; economic development spending; and the fate of a public health initiative.
All bills must pass the full House and Senate chambers by April 15.
The rest of the session, which must end by April 29, will be spent negotiating final compromises. Lawmakers are hoping to finish by April 25 to avoid coming back after a weekend.
“That’s the goal. You guys have met us, so that’s the goal,” Huston told reporters.

That abrupt change will affect approximately 6,500 undergraduates, according to the Florida Policy Institute.
When the measure went before the Florida Senate in February, South Florida Democrat Jason Pizzo offered an amendment to grandfather in any dreamer enrolled in a state college or university so they could continue pay that in-state tuition for an additional four years.
It didn’t pass.
Advocates aren’t giving up, though. This week, the group TheDream.US trekked to the Capitol to resume the fight. Specifically, they hope to revive the idea of allowing students now enrolled to continue paying in-state rates until they graduate.
“Right now, they’re working on the budget, and we know that the budget needs to pass, right?” said TheDream.US president and CEO Gaby Pacheco.
“And so it could be a potential vehicle for us to get a grandfathered-in clause. The hope is that the House as they’re working through this perhaps put in an amendment. We’re not legislators, so we don’t necessarily know the ins and outs. We’re just hoping that they know that this is important for the state of Florida, for their constituents, for these students and our college systems.”
Pacheco made regular visits to the Capitol in 2023 to defend against the threatened cutoff of in-state tuition for dreamers. Gov. Ron DeSantis announced before that legislative session a slate of proposals cracking down on illegal immigration.
Yet, somehow, the law survived that year. It wasn’t the first time that some Republicans in the Legislature had attempted to repeal the measure. But after last year’s election, in which illegal immigration was a central issue, DeSantis made it clear to state lawmakers at the beginning of this year that he wanted the law struck down.
‘Everything that I’ve fought for’
Among those joining Pacheco in the Capitol this week was a 20-year-old student from the University of Central Florida who wanted to be identified only by her first name of Callie, out of fear she could be targeted because of her immigration status.
She’s a junior majoring in advertising and public relations who has accumulated 80 credits toward her degree and says that will be up to 100 by the end of the spring semester — not enough yet to graduate.
But as of July 1, when the law takes effect, she’ll be forced to pay full tuition. “That means I can no longer afford my public education and will have to give up everything that I’ve fought for,” she said.
In addition to her studies, Cailie works between 20 and 36 hours a week at Publix and spends her free time volunteering to help students prepare college scholarship applications. Her tuition is roughly $2,800 a semester, covered through a scholarship from TheDream.US. It will more than double after the law takes effect — an amount she says she can’t bear.
Cailie, 20, migrated to the United States from Haiti almost seven years ago. Her parents aren’t supporting her, she said, as she was forced to leave home at 16. Her rough upbringing compelled her to try to make a better life for herself but, without the benefit of in-state tuition, “it’s impossible.”
She spent part of Tuesday meeting with lawmakers to explain her plight, although she knows it’s an uphill battle.
“It’s hard to get people to change their mind, so all we’re asking for are the current students to be grandfathered in and protected for now,” she said. “Because most of us only have a few more credits to go, and it’s so unfair that we had to fight so hard to get here and just knowing that all of a sudden it meant nothing? That’s hard.”
Cailie’s ambition is to start her own business helping other students from low-income families get educations like she’s been able to achieve — for now, anyway.
“I want to be a role model to show them that I come from an undeveloped country, that I didn’t have the same opportunities as everybody else, and I made it, so it’s possible. The U.S. is a country of opportunists, but now I’m wondering if that’s even true anymore.”
Pacheco acknowledges her group has limited leverage with the Legislature, but believes it’s worth the effort.
“At the end of the day, we’re practically begging,” she said. “We’re saying, ‘Please do not do this to these students. Please do not do this to 6,000 young people who have worked so hard to get so far, and that are so close to be able to get those college degrees.'”

(Photo by Karen Ducey/Getty Images)Emma McDonnell has one of those jobs it takes a few minutes to explain. She’s a biomedical informatics researcher in the University of Washington School of Medicine. But that doesn’t really explain what she does, even if you know what informatics is. Her research is centered on making health care and medical technology accessible to people with disabilities. 
Her Ph.D. and master’s degrees were in human-centered design, a field she describes as highly interdisciplinary. I just call it very cool. Human-centered design is something we didn’t know we needed until we had it. I predict the results of her research will become known to most of us someday because it is so essential. Consider the needs of the elderly, people who may not have grown up with disabilities but gain them as time goes on.
This isn’t a story celebrating McDonnell and her work. Unfortunately. This is a column about how she and other young researchers like her are wondering if they will be able to build a science career in a nation led by anti-science, anti-DEI politicians. And it’s about how that could have lasting consequences when it comes to advances in medicine and other fields. 
McDonnell is considering redirecting her research focus so she can attract federal grants when her training is complete, or just moving her career in an entirely different direction.
The Trump administration has demonstrated, through executive orders and other edicts, they do not want the U.S. government to support research that focuses on diversity, equity and inclusion because those topics do not help the majority of Americans (their words, definitely not mine).

McDonnell reminded me: DEI is not just about race and ethnicity, it’s also about accessibility. 
She is in the first year of a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at UW, paid for by the National Library of Medicine, a division of the National Institutes of Health, a federal agency that has been ordered by the president to cut research grants. McDonnell is definitely not the only UW postdoc worried about their future right now. UW has about 450 postdocs in the School of Medicine, nearly all of them paid by dollars from the federal government.
The University of Washington is one of the top research universities in the country. This is underscored by the amount of research dollars they get from the federal government. Federal dollars make up 55% of all university research dollars nationally. UW is No. 5 nationally in its spending of this money, according to the National Science Foundation. That money pays for labs and people across the university, not just the School of Medicine.
While McDonnell is part of a national program focused on making health care more efficient, her part of the research is clearly about accessibility. Health disparities that people with disabilities face were declared a focus last year, when Joe Biden was president — and not telling NIH what to do. Now, unfortunately, that area is a target instead of a priority.
“None of us are really sure what it will look like having a career in this very important work if it’s basically banned from the top,” McDonnell told me.
The cuts have begun
The first cuts in government research dollars were around projects on gender and climate, but disability and accessibility are on the list. 
Donald Trump has made it clear that he is ready to punish any university that allows students to express their First Amendment rights too vociferously. Cutting federal research dollars is one way to go about that, as the U.S. government is the main source of funds to pay for expensive labs and the people who work in them. 
Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and Stanford have already been targeted. I expect UW, where students protested the war in Gaza for months last year, could be too. The Department of Education, in early March, included the university on a list of 60 it says were under investigation for antisemitic harassment and discrimination, warning of “potential enforcement actions.” 
About 1,900 scientists, all members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, recently called the Trump administration’s research cuts a “wholesale assault on U.S. science” in an open letter, saying the cuts threaten the health and safety of Americans.
Research cuts at UW have begun around both DEI-related topics and vaccine hesitancy, according to Shelly Sakiyama-Elbert, vice dean for research and graduate education, in the University of Washington School of Medicine.
“We’re definitely concerned,” Sakiyama-Elbert said. “We’re seeing a lot of delays in rewards, in next year’s funding, without much explanation.”
She said they’ve experienced delays in both the review process and the issuing of new grants. And the termination of current grants has also begun. The process is fluid, so Sakiyama-Elbert couldn’t give an exact dollar figure for the cuts, but if you add in the research where UW is a subcontractor, the losses are already in the millions for just the School of Medicine. 
The School of Medicine is also concerned about the NIH proposal to cut grants for indirect costs, which pays for research facilities and other overhead, to 15%. The current UW standard is 55.5% campus-wide, which is pretty standard nationwide. A cut like this would result in an estimated decrease of $91 million for just the School of Medicine, Sakiyama-Elbert said. That NIH proposal is tied up in the courts after Washington state and others sued to stop it. 
“With so much uncertainty, we just don’t know how big the impact is going to be,” she added, noting that the toll might also be seen 10 or 20 years down the road, when needed scientific discoveries don’t materialize. 
The human impact
Cutting the university’s overall research budget is a big financial concern for UW administrators, but Sakiyama-Elbert says the real worry is what will happen to young researchers like McDonnell. UW has already instituted a hiring freeze which means fewer doctoral students and postdocs will be able to get jobs in research labs. 
She believes the brain drain could happen at three points in the process of training future scientists: from undergrad to graduate school when students decide to pursue a different career, from graduate school to Ph.D. programs when some future scientists will be turned away because of a lack of funding, and from postdoc to professorships when jobs may be limited. 
A similar brain drain happened during the 2008-2010 recession when research money was also cut. What scientific discoveries were delayed or never happened because some postdocs never pursued their research ideas? Which medical advances will be delayed this time? 
While McDonnell could pivot and work in another part of human-centered design for a few years and see if the climate for accessibility research improves, she doesn’t want to do that. She is passionate about her work and her brain is filled with ideas for future research. She also recognizes her place as a role model for other students like her.
“I identify as disabled. I want to be at a place where my disabled students feel safe,” she said. So far, the University of Washington is a place like that and has been for a long time, with a strong computer science focus on accessibility, for example. 
UW is also a place where many international students come to learn and research and both McDonnell and Sakiyama-Elbert are concerned about their international colleagues. 
“We’ve really benefited from having such brilliant and creative people wanting to come to the United States,” Sakiyama-Elbert said. She’s heard about potential international brain drain: American students and postdocs saying they are going to look outside the U.S. for postdoc fellowships and faculty jobs. The uncertainty is scary for these folks, she added. 
Cutting federal research grants could deal a variety of hits to individuals and the Washington economy, because UW is just one place where federal dollars are fueling science, paying for construction and funding scientific research.
“My intent for myself is I’m going to save my panic for July, which is when I have to start looking for jobs,” McDonnell said.
For the rest of us, who will benefit from the research McDonnell and her colleagues do – or don’t do – the time to panic may be further off. Most people don’t realize how long it takes to develop a cure to cancer or an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s. Four years of eroding federal support could delay life-saving treatments for decades.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/uw-medicne-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)If Indiana were to start from scratch and legalize casino gambling today, we obviously wouldn’t leave out the state’s two largest population centers.
That’s why I am intrigued by a bill that would study casino reorganization — from the transfer of an existing, underperforming license to potentially adding a new license.
Senate Bill 43 was the result of a failed attempt to move the Rising Star casino in southern Indiana to New Haven, just outside of Fort Wayne. The intense opposition stopped that idea, but led to the next one.
The legislation requires the Indiana Gaming Commission to contract out for a study to identify two regions where a license could locate, which could add a 14th license to the mix.
Honestly, I think the state needs a much broader study looking at gambling overall.
Since Indiana legalized the lottery in 1988, lawmakers have approved virtually every other gambling option you can think about. Riverboat casinos (which have since moved onto land); racinos (which started out as slots at the horse tracks and now are full-fledged casinos); sports betting; charitable gambling; and low-stakes gambling at bars.
iGaming proposal for lottery and casinos dead for the session

All of these are cannibalizing each other at some point. Not to mention the interactive online gambling that casinos and the Hoosier Lottery are seeking. That bill also stalled this session.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, called the study “incredibly shortsighted” in an opposing speech from the Senate floor last month.
“If we are really going to look at this, instead of doing this piecemeal, then let’s really look at our gambling revenues,” Brown said. “… If we care, then we should have an honest look at our gaming revenue that we’re seeing. Whether it’s horse tracks, whether it’s the sports betting or whether it’s the on-the-ground casinos.”
“It’s a Jenga game. They all need to be looked at in a fix,” Brown added.
But alas, we will stick with the current discussion.
I understand that when gambling started in Indiana, lawmakers chose to put facilities near state lines to attract gamblers hailing from other states in which it wasn’t legal. But it’s a different world now.
It makes no sense that the Indianapolis and Fort Wayne areas don’t have casinos — if, indeed, the goal is to maximize tax revenue to the state.
An amendment made to Senate Bill 43 acknowledged this, by narrowing the study from three regions to two.
Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said any “serious conversation” about a license needed to include his hometown, adding that the southeastern casino was “dying.”
“If the purpose of gaming is revenue, why there is not a casino in downtown Indianapolis defies my understanding,” Freeman said. “Because it would support all of our tourism, all of our big games, all our industry. Everything in Indianapolis — it would support it.”
Some Indiana gambling operators have said this is destabilizing. And, of course, if you move a license to Indianapolis, it will impact the number of people from central Indiana willing to drive to the racinos in Shelbyville or Anderson. Same for Fort Wayne.
But I think lawmakers need to look at the overall health of the industry and taxes brought to the state, rather than individual operators. According to annual reports by the Indiana Gaming Commission, gaming and sports wagering operations brought in $691 million in taxes in fiscal year 2022. That dropped down to $655 million in fiscal year 2024.
Maybe the answer is fewer licenses overall, but placed for maximum impact. Maybe a study would find we need to go all in on more expansions. Or maybe we are right where we need to be. We need to think bigger, and consider what’s best for all of Indiana.

He ended up deported, sent back to Mexico, a country the 39-year-old Kansas husband and father left at the age of 4.
“Everything was approved, and I arrived here with no problem,” said Cortez Martinez, a DACA recipient, in a phone interview from Cuernavaca, a city south of Mexico City.

On March 23, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials stopped Cortez Martinez at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport as he presented documents to board a flight back to Kansas City.
He was held, questioned and put on a flight to Mexico City that evening.
“I asked them, ‘Can I just call my lawyer and try to see if I can work things out,’” Cortez Martinez said. “They said, ‘No, you don’t have that option.’”
His attorney argues otherwise, filing a case Wednesday, April 2, with a Texas federal court.
“How many others are out there that this has also happened to, but who didn’t have the ability to get counsel?” said Rekha Sharma-Crawford, the Kansas City-based attorney who filed the case in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Texas. “The law is on his side.”
 Potential test case

The case could become a test of the limits of the Trump administration’s reach.
Advocates argue the administration’s zeal to deport is increasingly overstepping, scooping up immigrants, even those legally present, and not allowing due process.
The lawsuit seeks “declaratory, injunctive and mandamus relief to find that Defendants actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”
It’s filed against the U.S. Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and other government officials.
U.S. Immigration officials do not generally comment on specific cases.
But in a statement released to NPR recently, Customs and Border Protection argued it was merely enforcing the law.
“Those who violate these laws will be processed, detained, and removed as required,” CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham said in the statement.
Customs agents in Dallas told Cortez Martinez that he had been ordered removed in absentia on June 11, 2024, and that his documents to travel had been issued in error.
Cortez Martinez said he had never been notified of a removal order, which is the legal term for what most people colloquially refer to as deportation.
The Roeland Park, Kansas, resident is staying with the one Mexico relative he knows, an uncle.
Cortez Martinez is believed to be the first Kansas City-area case of a DACA  (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipient caught in the Trump administration’s vow to deport millions of people.
The latest Trump plan is called Operation Take Back America.
The lawsuit argues that Cortez Martinez has the right to appear before an immigration judge.
“Under current regulations, a holder of an Advance Parole document cannot be barred from the country (removed) without a formal removal hearing before an Immigration Judge,” the suit states.
Advance parole is the process Cortez Martinez went through, with the aid of an attorney, to travel outside of the U.S. as a DACA recipient.
His recurring two-year renewals of DACA had been approved by the government like clockwork. His current DACA is valid until October 2026.
DACA was designed by the Obama administration in 2012. It was meant to be a carveout for immigrants known as “Dreamers,” those who’d been brought to the U.S. as young children, without legal status.
DACA is a temporary reprieve from deportation. It also allows for work authorization and for people to apply for travel outside of the country, through advance parole.
The removal order the government cited is from June 2024.
“He’s not hiding, Sharma-Crawford said. “He’s doing everything that he’s supposed to be doing.”
Cortez Martinez has lived in the Kansas City area for nearly 20 years.
His wife, child and stepchildren are anxiously waiting for his return to their suburban home.
 Rising immigrant fears of being deported

Cortez Martinez’s case is the first deportation of a Kansas City-area DACA recipient that Nubia Estefes is aware of occurring.
“It’s one of our fears,” said Estefes, executive director of the Kansas Missouri Dream Alliance, an advocacy group for “Dreamers.”
Before Trump took office, a few other area DACA recipients traveled back to their birth nations on the same documents that Cortez Martinez used, advance parole.
The trips were taken with counsel by attorneys, to ensure that nothing could be resurrected in their history as a rationale for deportation, Estefes said.
“It’s personal discretion on the part of the officers,” she said of the scrutiny that occurs at Customs.
News stories that even documented people have been deported are alarming the immigrant community.
“We’re definitely siding with the cautious side,” Estefes said. “If you don’t have to go, if it’s not life or death, I would suggest you wait it out.”
El Centro, a Kansas social service agency, is also advising immigrants to be careful.
Justin Gust, vice president of community engagement, said the agency is continuing the help with DACA renewal applications.
But even immigrants who are legal permanent residents are being advised to take precautions, especially when traveling.
“It just seems like everything is unknown these days,” Gust said. “What was a protected status, or a protected issue, is no longer protected.”
People are disabling face recognition or a thumbprint to open their cellphone, as a safeguard against having their data combed for anything a customs agent might deem offensive to the Trump administration’s goals.
“We’re advising people that they really do need to talk to their lawyer first and don’t go just to go, because you definitely need to know that you can come back,” Gust said.
 A beloved grandfather, hazy memory of Mexico

Cortez Martinez’s sole memory of his native Mexico is a limited one, possibly bolstered more by family stories than a true memory.
But his grandfather is central.
Cornelio Martinez Dominguez owned a panaderia, a bakery.
“I’ve been told that every time the bread was ready, I’d run to my grandpa,” Cortez Martinez said.
Through the years, he spoke with his grandfather by phone. But he’d never returned to Mexico.
Sharma-Crawford first contacted the CBP Watch Commander at the Dallas Fort Worth airport, seeing if the office would intervene.
She did not receive a reply.
“There are real questions if he was properly notified,” she said of Martinez’s order of removal.
Still, the existence of the order wouldn’t negate his right to be granted advance parole, she said.
Sharma-Crawford suspects that the Trump administration has begun re-calendaring removal cases that had previously been closed.
“I never got any notice,” Cortez Martinez said of the removal order. “I never got any citations to go see a judge.”
Cortez Martinez received the approval to travel from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in early March. The document is valid until April 14, 2025, according to the lawsuit.
Still, he had been initially hesitant to take the trip.
He only considered doing so, as his grandfather’s health worsened.
In November, his grandfather died before the paperwork was approved.
The visit was shortened to a three-day excursion, just enough time to reach the cemetery a few hours outside of Mexico City, and then return to Kansas City.
“That’s the grandpa I wanted to be able to say goodbye to,” Cortez Martinez said.

Ford/Maryland Matters)Just hours after the Senate approved the Second Look Act, the House on Thursday quickly accepted Senate amendments to the bill that gives a second chance to long-serving incarcerated individuals and sent the measure to the governor for his signature.
It capped months of debate of emotional, and often personal, debate on House Bill 853, which critics said would bring needless new suffering to victims of crime, but supporters said would provide a deserved second chance to those in prison who had turned their lives around.
The Senate on Wednesday, by a one-vote margin, approved an amendment that would make the Second Look Act unavailable to anyone convicted of killing a first responder in the line of duty.
That cleared the way for the Senate to approve the bill 31-16 and sent it back to the House, which had approved the bill two weeks ago, on an 89-49 vote. House members voted 89-47 for the amended bill Thursday night and sent it to the governor.
Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County), the lead sponsor of the House bill, was not a fan of many of the amendments the bill picked up along the way, but said after Thursday’s vote that “you have to start somewhere.”

“No one is born into this world or wakes up in the morning to think about doing evil or doing wrong to other people,” Pasteur said.
“I am looking forward to these people who are willing to be out in our communities, helping some of these young people who feel alone and abandoned … Now some of these people will be able to make a difference in their lives,” she said.
Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) said the bill is about protecting those who are prison, but who are innocent.
“This is about people who languish in our state prisons for decades for a crime they didn’t commit,” Acevero said. “Where is the compassion for them? Where is the justice for those folks? I heard none of that from the minority party in the entirety of the debate on this bill. This is what you call legislating for the innocent.”
House Minority Whip Jesse Pippy (R-Frederick) responded, telling Acevero, “I always enjoy when you get up.”
“You just made an assertion on the floor that every single person locked up for killing someone, killing a kid, killing police officers are all innocent, according to your speech … So, I take offense that,” Pippy said looking Acevero’s direction.
“We have folks that have done very bad things and they’re incarcerated for it, and we don’t want those individuals getting out and revictimizing a whole bunch of other people,” Pippy said.
Under the bill, some people who have served at least 20 years of a prison sentence could petition the court for a sentence reduction. That option would not be available to someone sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or to a sex offender — and, after the Senate amendment, to someone convicted of killing a first responder, like a police officer, firefighter or paramedic.
The bill had already been narrowed once from the version Pasteur had drafted, limiting the second chance in the act to those convicted of a crime they committed between the ages of 18 and 25.
An individual who appeals to the court for a reduced sentence and is denied would have to wait three years before filing another petition. Prisoners could file up to three petitions, but “an individual may not file a fourth motion to reduce the duration of the sentence,” according to the bill.
Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s), who voted against the bill Thursday, sponsored the Senate amendment Wednesday to put the act out of those convicted of killing a first responder “in the line of duty.” That amendent passed on a slim 24-23 margin.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) said people convicted of violent offenses who had harmed others ‘on purpose” could receive a second look under the bill.
“We’ve done a lot to try to reform the criminal justice system in this state. This body, I think, has gone too far,” Ready said during Thurday’s nearly 25-minute debate in the Senate. “These were people convicted as adults of very serious crimes. They should not get a second look that’s really a 17th or 18th look.”
The bill’s supporter have long said that it is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for what opponents call the worst of the worst, but something for those who have really turned their lives around.
Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County), defended the bill Wednesday, highlighting how courts can assess several factors to determine whether someone incarcerated has earned a reduced sentence. Some factors would include a person’s age at the time of offense, demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation and that person’s family background.
On Thursday, Sydnor stood in the Senate and highlighted that all victims’ families “are not a monolith.” He began to choke up when he recalled the summer of 1991, when his cousin was shot in the head.
A few years ago, Sydnor said a session ended to honor another cousin who suddenly died around Sydnor’s birthday.
“The story goes in my family he died of a broken heart. His brother was murdered,” Sydnor said while choking up. “If these people, whoever committed those crimes, showed that they did what they needed to do to reenter society, I’d welcome them with open arms. As I said yesterday, this is about grace. I stand on that.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sens.-Charles-Sydnor-III-and-Joanne-C.-Benson-4-3-2025-1024x760.jpg,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)As I sat in my oldest brother’s room at Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, listening to the alarm shriek that his oxygen levels were critically low, I kept batting away intrusive thoughts about the federal budget battle happening hundreds of miles away in D.C. None of the Washington policymakers in their fancy suits could possibly understand the position my family was in, seeing Medicaid dollars go toward making my brother more comfortable in the last minutes of his life.
Medicaid has been essential for multiple people in my family, but in particular my oldest brother. To call his health care needs complicated would be an understatement. He was born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease. His birth parents originally thought he wouldn’t survive due to fracturing most of his bones during the birthing process. But he survived and, due to numerous factors, his birth parents relinquished their parental rights. 
He was sent to live in a pediatric nursing home. My parents adopted him at the age of four, and he grew up receiving orthopedic care through the private insurance my father received through his job at UNC-Greensboro. In high school, his care grew more complicated as he was diagnosed with other physical, mental health, and developmental disabilities, and my parents tried to help him transition into adulthood. They wanted all their children to enjoy as much independence as possible, and my older brother was no exception. 
There was a lot of back and forth on where my brother would live as an adult. Eventually, it was decided he could be most independent at an assisted living facility. And for a while, that seemed to work out. However, after a year at the facility, he had multiple major medical issues, physical and mental, that threw that decision into question. My parents gained medical guardianship over him and were able to obtain a Medicaid waiver that allowed him to live in the community with a care attendant. And while his medical situation remained difficult over the years, we always knew we could count on Medicaid to help provide the care he needed to remain as independent as possible. 
It felt ironic to see congressional Republicans once again jeopardize Medicaid at the same time that my brother was on a ventilator fighting for his life. Because of Medicaid, our choices surrounding my brother’s emergency hospitalization and end-of-life comfort care were not hampered by concerns around expenses. Without Medicaid, our experience would have been much more difficult. Almost three million North Carolinians are covered under Medicaid, with a 2023 expansion allowing an additional 470,000 people to be covered in the first seven months. The state spent $27.8 billion to provide critical healthcare to those who needed it under Medicaid last year and received $18.9 billion from the federal government.
After my brother’s passing, I think about those still receiving life-saving care through Medicaid. It’s outrageous to think congressional Republicans want to line millionaires’ pockets with money that’s helped North Carolinians like my brother receive life-sustaining care, including two million people who live in districts governed by the same elected officials who are pushing for these cuts. 
As the disability community continues to grow, it’s imperative that Congress refrain from these harmful efforts to cut or limit benefits via burdensome proof of work, block grants, or lifetime caps. All the suggestions congressional Republicans have made to “reduce costs” through Medicaid will leave more disabled people dead, homeless, or institutionalized. 
Shame on them.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)The Environmental Protection Agency has long been a favorite target of the budget knife, but a new looming threat is different in magnitude and impact.
The Office of Research and Development has long been the nerve center of the EPA, generating the critical research behind the action.
Under a proposed agency plan unveiled last month, the Office of Research and Development would be cut and over 1,100 scientists would either lose their jobs or be reassigned to positions in other places.
In Oklahoma, this office is located at Robert S. Kerr Environmental Science Research Center in Ada, and would be liquidated under the plan. Canceling it would be like removing EPA’s brain and just hoping that the limbs of the body still know what to do.
Many EPA administrators or Interior secretaries have been hostile to environmentalism, but current EPA head Lee Zeldin takes it to a new extreme. He wants to cut the agency’s existing $10.9 billion budget by 65% and has announced the “biggest deregulatory action in US history” with 31 policy proposals designed to roll back Obama and Biden policies on climate change, environmental justice and tribal consultation.
If someone accidentally dumped 2,000 gallons of diesel fuel right next to your city’s water supply, you would rightly be extremely concerned that your water would become contaminated and maybe people would become ill. If the diesel got into an aquifer, that water might be ruined for thousands of years and the very existence of the city would be threatened.
It’s actually the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Science Research Center that helps state and federal officials figure out how to respond to such environmental disasters.
Kerr Lab is the sole federal groundwater research lab in the country. One of its tasks is to do research on the characterization and remediation of ground water. Because of the research performed at Kerr Lab, when disaster strikes, first responders have research on what to do. Strategies have been tested in the lab and again under real world conditions.
It is very hard to get people to care about groundwater when they can’t see it or drive their boat on it. But when our groundwater becomes undrinkable, I am sure people will wonder what happened.
Oklahoma is a leader in water science because of former U.S. Sen. Robert S. Kerr’s vision. Kerr, also a former Democratic Oklahoma governor, perceived the state’s water related opportunities and had the political leverage to act upon these needs. Through his urging in the U.S. Senate, the Kerr Lab was built in 1966 in Ada after the passage of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1961. The EPA was authorized in 1970 and groundwater became the lab’s focus in 1979.
The Kerr Lab made more history in 2024 when it became the first EPA lab in the country to sign a memorandum of understanding with a Native tribe, the Chickasaw Nation. A hydrologist was recently hired under this plan to research aquifers of interest to the Chickasaw Nation and the State of Oklahoma.
Kerr called his revelation about the importance of water to Oklahoma “the flood of conviction” which occurred at Muskogee in 1943. The Arkansas River flooded, killing 26 and washing away crops and topsoil. The damage was over $31 million. As governor, Kerr promoted farm pond construction and 66,700 ponds were built between 1943-1947 for flood control. The concept of “leaky ponds” is one that EPA scientists in Ada are still working on regarding aquifer recharge research. Kerr envisioned a research mission to solve problems, not just analytical labs.
As director of the Water Resource Policy and Management masters of science degree at Ada’s East Central University, I regularly collaborate with Kerr Lab. Eliminating the Office of Research and Development would shame Kerr’s legacy and deprive Oklahomans and Americans from needed groundwater research.
It is actually not clear how eliminating the Office of Research and Development would be accomplished because it was created by statute. Only Congress would be able to eliminate the office. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) calls the move illegal.
In any case, one thing is for sure, the 76 EPA employees in Ada set to be fired or reassigned are watching the news very closely. Let’s hope our state and federal officials are doing the same.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Hundreds of students in the Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) have been tested for lead poisoning as the district continues navigating controversy after several school closures due to lead contamination. City officials said during a Thursday morning press conference that 249 students and their siblings have been tested since January. Three schools remain closed including Fernwood Montessori School, Starms Early Childhood Center, and LaFollete School, while four other schools which were previously closed have been re-opened. 
MPS also announced that its senior director of facilities director and management is leaving the district, effective immediately. The district is now looking for a new director to help address lead hazards in MPS schools. Sean Kane had been with MPS for 25 years. MPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius thanked him for his service during the Thursday morning press conference at the MPS Administration Building. 
“I will immediately begin a search for a permanent replacement to lead the district,” said Cassellius, adding that Michael Mannan, the Milwaukee Health Department’s director of home environmental health, and Mike Turza, a retired MPS employee who was re-hired in March after nine years of retirement are assisting during the transition. Turza was brought onto Cassellius’ transition team to help with an operational audit requested by the governor’s office.

Kane has become a central figure in the MPS lead contamination controversy. While working as facilities director, Kane had failed to keep his architecture license current. In March, the state Department of Health Services issued a letter blasting lead remediation work done by MPS employees overnight at Fernwood Montessori. The letter said that 11 employees conducting the lead remediation may not have been trained to do so, and that students had been allowed back into classrooms which were still contaminated. 
“We must move forward with a plan that everyone has confidence in, that everyone trusts, and that puts the wellbeing of our students and staff at the forefront,” said Cassellius. Mayor Cavalier Johnson was also in attendance, and praised the collaborative efforts between MPS, the health department and the state government, as well as MPS leaders’ care and attention to families. “There’s nothing, absolutely nothing more important than the health and wellbeing of kids in Milwaukee,” said Johnson. “We recognize that there are issues, and we are actively working to address those issues with keeping the health and again, the wellbeing, of kids at the forefront.” 
This week, Kane was fined $1,319 by the state Department of Safety and Professional Services for violating state law, and misrepresenting himself as an architect since his license lapsed nearly five years ago. While his license was invalid, Kane was appointed facilities and management director in October 2021.
Cassellius wouldn’t comment on personnel matters involving Kane. During the Thursday press conference, however, Milwaukee Health Commissioner Dr. Mike Totoraitis said, “I never want to see anybody lose their job or their role, however I do think at this moment, it was warranted to help move us into this next step.”

Totoraitis also answered questions from media about emails showing that Kane did not allow health department staff into Golda Meir School to do a full lead risk assessment, and did not disclose that lead remediation work was ongoing after a student was found to have lead poisoning. “I was frustrated,” said Totoraitis. “Our team was also ready to send a staff of about eight individuals and lead risk assessors to go to the schools. We were ready to work that weekend.” 
The health commissioner said that 249 students and their siblings have been tested for lead poisoning. Others have received  routine screening at pediatric offices. Totoraitis also said “we have pivoted” from using dust swab samples inside buildings to using a checklist and visual inspection — which he said is outlined in state statute — “to ensure that we are quickly assessing the schools, as opposed to doing the dust wipe samples which usually take a week and a half to get processed.” In some cases, Totoraitis said that ceiling and floor tiling is being checked and sealed to prevent lead intruding into the schools. 
A plan to tackle the lead contamination has been drafted and officials said it will eventually be released to the public. Testing and screening of students will continue, “because that’s the best way for us to determine if children have been poisoned or not,” said Totoraitis. 
In late March, Totoraitits said that the city issued a formal request to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for additional assistance, and had received federal assistance in recent months. Mass layoffs in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and funding cuts by the Trump administration have put additional assistance in question. 
On Thursday, Gov. Tony Evers highlighted a plan to tackle lead contamination in his weekly radio address. The plan includes over $300 million to fund initiatives aimed at removing lead service lines contaminating drinking water and supporting lead renovation programs. Childhood lead contamination has been linked to cognitive disorders including degraded impulse control, learning disabilities, and violent behavior. About 85 MPS schools were built before 1970 and are therefore at high risks of lead contamination.

Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, delivers an impassioned speech from the Senate floor on April 3, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that would prohibit transgender female athletes from playing on college teams that align with their gender identity passed the Indiana Senate on Thursday with bipartisan support on a 42-6 vote. 
It now goes to Gov. Mike Braun for his signature.
Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, sponsored House Bill 1041, painting it as a “common sense” measure “that ensures female athletes have a fair and equal playing field.”
“This bill is about maintaining the integrity of women’s sports and the scholarships (of) these women who train and work to be an athlete,” said Donato in her closing remarks. 
Democrats disputed Donato’s characterization of fairness, noting that the bill does nothing to ensure equal pay for female coaches or address disparate funding. 
Furthermore, Democrats argued that the bill was unnecessary since the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Trump administration and Braun administration have all enacted their own policies barring transgender female athletes from playing on college teams. 
“(The bill) is yet another example of unnecessary language that serves no other purpose than to remind someone that they are ‘other.’ That they are not accepted here. That their own (elected) representation looks down on them,” said Sen. J.D. Ford. “… I think we should be better than this and I think Hoosiers deserve better.”
Legislation from the 2022 session barred transgender female athletes from playing in K-12 sports. 
 Bill discussion from opponents

Ford and another Democrat, Minority Senate Leader Shelli Yoder, blasted the bill for a lack of protections for accused students from harassment. 


The six Democrats voting against House Bill 1041 are: 

Sen. J.D. Ford, Indianapolis
Sen. Andrea Hunley, Indianapolis
Sen. La Keisha Jackson, Indianapolis
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, Indianapolis 
Sen. Mark Spencer, Gary
Sen. Shelli Yoder, Bloomington



“Women who work really hard — spending their lives training tirelessly to be an elite athlete — will be accused of being trans because their work has made them too bulky or too muscular or not feminine. And all it takes is one person to point that out and (they’ll) have complete immunity,” Ford said. 
Such accusations have already occurred on the Olympic level, notably with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, he said. 
Yoder piled on, naming several coaches around the state who had been sentenced for sexually abusing their athletes, including the infamous Larry Nassar, who abused over 100 female gymnasts.
“There is no language that protects against genital inspections, forced disclosure of medical history or invasive questioning by coaches or school officials. There is nothing in (House Bill) 1041 to stop a coach, athletic trainer or administrator from asking a student to prove their gender. Nothing,” said Yoder, of Bloomington. “What is in this bill is the license to discriminate. A license to sexually harass. And we’ve seen what happens when adults in positions of authority abuse that power.”
Instead, Yoder said the bill would invite more scrutiny and endanger students who don’t otherwise fit into a mold — such as intersex students, who are not mentioned in the bill’s language. 
 Support from Republicans

Republicans who spoke on the bill saw otherwise. 
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, shared her experience playing on college teams as an athlete. She said she practiced with the man, used the same equipment, ate the same food and stayed in the same hotels. 
“I don’t want to compete against a man. There are certainly women who I competed against who were far superior to me, but I knew I had, literally and figuratively, a fighting chance,” Brown said. “… The only reason we’re passing this bill now is because opportunities are being taken away from women.”

She and other Republicans pointed to viral videos of female athletes getting injured playing against a transgender female volleyball player or wins from transgender female swimmers. 
Sen. Spencer Deery, R-West Lafayette, specifically targeted a statistic from the NCAA president, who told a Congressional panel that there are “fewer than 10” transgender athletes on college teams. 
“It may be 10 today, but I assure you: if we look the other way, it will not be ten tomorrow,” said Deery.
In an impassioned rebuttal, Sen. Chris Garten said the examples of sexual harassment had “nothing to do with” House Bill 1041, naming female athletes harmed while playing. 
“This is us taking a stand and protecting girls from injuries in competitive sports against biological males,” said Garten, R-Charlestown. 
None of the supporting Democrats spoke on the bill.

On Wednesday, the Idaho Humanities Council — alongside all other state humanities councils across the country — received a letter notifying it that its federal funding was cancelled, effective immediately. The letter is signed by the endowment’s acting chairman. 
“NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” the letter reads. 
The funding cancellation is a part of a wave to cut federal spending under the Trump administration. The move strips 75% of the Idaho Humanities Council’s budget, council executive director David Pettyjohn told the Idaho Capital Sun. In addition to reducing funds for salaries, administrative costs and outreach efforts, the federal funding cuts threaten grants for history, literature and art projects across the state. 
“This grant is a five-year grant, and we were just awarded it,” Pettyjohn said. “We receive funding each year, and last year it was about $930,000.”
Pettyjohn said the federal funding is incredibly important for Idaho, especially as it prepares to celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary since the signing of the Declaration of Independence next year.
“We are uniquely positioned to bring Idaho together to discuss our past,” Pettyjohn said. “The humanities transcend politics. It is what brings us together. It is what helps us find common ground. We have been incredibly proud of our ability to successfully do that for over 52 years, and the cancellation of this funding puts that at severe threat.”
 The role of the Idaho Humanities Council

Established in 1973, the Idaho Humanities Council is a nonprofit. It does not receive state funding, but relies on private funding and grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Idaho officials join America250 initiative to celebrate the founding of the United States

The national endowment is the largest public funder of humanities projects in the U.S., awarding $6 billion to humanities across the country since 1965. The federal agency supports museums, historic sites, universities, teachers, libraries, filmmakers, radio stations, scholars and other humanities programs. 
Between 2020 to 2023, the federal agency gave more than $5.7 million to the Idaho council and individual projects. 
With support from the federal funds, the council funded projects in 27 out of Idaho’s 44 counties in fiscal year 2024, ranging from projects highlighting veterans living in the Hagerman Valley, programs and exhibits at the Boise Art Museum, and speaker events across the state. 
Federal funding also allows the council to bring Smithsonian exhibits to Idaho. 
“It is something that only state humanities councils are able to do in partnership with the Smithsonian traveling exhibit service,” Pettyjohn said. “Most of us don’t have the opportunity to travel to D.C. and actually be at the Smithsonian, so in order for the Smithsonian to come to these communities, they have designed exhibits that fit in small spaces and it does not cost the community a thing.” 
This year’s exhibit was supposed to open in July in Burley, Moscow, Coeur d’Alene and end in Priest River. But now, those plans are now on pause — along with all other programs and grants — as the council is determining the validity of the letter, Pettyjohn said. 
“We have been completely compliant with everything NEH has asked of us in the last 52 years of our existence, and all of my fellow councils have been the same way,” he said. “This was really unexpected.”
 Remaining grant cancelled for local professor leading Treasure Valley history project 

Rachel Miller, a history professor at the College of Idaho, received a letter on Thursday that the remaining funding for a history project she received in 2023 from the National Endowment for the Humanities was cancelled. 
For more than a year, Miller has led a project with the help of her students to create an oral history project called the “Voices of the Treasure Valley.” The goal of the project is to collect the stories of people who have lived in southwest Idaho and experienced its rapid change over the last few decades. 
“We are creating materials that will be available to everyone, and we are helping to build a state archive that represents recent history, which is maybe not always what we think of when we think of documenting Idaho’s history,” Miller told the Sun. 
Though she used most of the $25,000 in funding already, she said cutting projects like hers limits access to humanities, making them available only to those with a lot of resources. 
“This grant really made humanities education available to students who probably wouldn’t otherwise get it, and it really bolsters humanities programs at institutions that really need it,” Miller said.  
With the grant, Miller was able to give her students experience outside of the classroom, connecting them with community members who have witnessed historical change. The funding supported field trips, the hiring two student interns and the purchase of recording devices for high-quality audio. The grant also allowed Miller to compensate community partners who shared their time and expertise. 
“If we don’t support the humanities, I think we are saying something really destructive about our belief in the importance of getting to know each other as humans,” Miller said.

The House Tuesday give final approval to the Senate bill, which has already been sent to the goveror. The Senate unanimously passed the House version Thursday with minor technical amendments that need to be accepted by the House before it can be sent to the governor, too.
The measures are sponsored by Carpenter-Grantham’s District 20 representatives, Montgomery County Democrats Sen. William C. Smith Jr. and Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, and co-sponsored by Dels. David Moon and Lorig Charkoudian, among others.
Carpenter-Grantham and his mother, Linda Carpenter-Grantham, traveled to Annapolis last month, when the House and Senate approved both measures in their respective chambers on the same day.
“The significance of that bill is that it was an idea that came from a constituent.

It’s very rare where you get a story, where you can start from a small seed of an idea, and then it grows to like an actual piece of legislation that’s going to impact a lot of people.”
PFAS bills presumed dead
A bill that would have banned certain PFAS chemicals from pesticides in the state is dead for this year after environmental groups and safety advocates pulled their support, the sponsor of the Senate bill said.
The groups initially backed the bills, House Bill 386 and Senate Bill 345, which would have banned the sale of pesticides containing PFAS, chemicals that have been linked to serious health issues and are known as “forever chemicals” because they are extremely slow to break down in the environment and the body.
But the groups reneged after the definition of PFAS compounds was narrowed in the legislation, a change that was backed by some pesticide manufacturers. Under the amendment, PFAS would need to have two fluorinated carbon atoms, a departure from state law, which currently requires only one.
Advocates worried that more-narrow definition could be used in other areas of state law dealing with PFAS. That disagreement ultimately sank the bill, said Sen. Benjamin Brooks (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored the Senate version.
“The supporters of the bill, they are just that entrenched, that they just cannot go with the double carbon,” Brooks said. “So, it would be better to hold off for this session — maybe even next session — and come back.”
It’s the second high-profile PFAS measure to stumble in the closing weeks of the legislative session. Senate Bill 732 and House Bill 909 would have limited PFAS levels in the sewage sludge that comes from wastewater treatment plants, and is often applied to farm fields as fertilizer. But lawmakers said they could not reach agreement with treatment facilities.
Bonnie Raindrop, coordinator of Maryland’s Smart on Pesticides Coalition, said she was grateful to hear that the pesticide bill’s shrunken PFAS definition would not advance into law. She is fearful that President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency will soon consider the narrowed definition at the request of chemical industry groups.
“We are glad that they won’t be able to point to Maryland and this bill as a justification for ‘harmonizing’ the definition to the 2-carbon definition,” Raindrop said in a statement.
Senate amends health education bill
The Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee had issues with some of the content of House Bill 161. How much of an issue? The committee’s amendment struck everything between “Section 1. Be it enacted” on the first page to “Section 2. And bi itfurther enacted” on the final page.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXHB161 once prohibited parents from opting their children out of required age-appropriate instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, drawing scathing criticism from House Republicans who argued that those discussions are best held at home, not in the classroom.
The Senate amendmments, filed Wednesday, remove all the controversial provisions. Now, the bill simply affirms that counties must align their curriculum to state standards and creates a process to correct county curriculum if it is out of alignment with those standards.
The Senate voted to approve the committee amendment Thursday morning, overhauling the legislation and removing the required instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation language in the process. It gave final approval to the amended bill laterin the day, on a 33012 vote.
“The committee saw an opportunity to … create a broader and clearer process,” Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City and Baltimore County) said when defending the legislation later Thursday. “While this started in one place, it sort of highlighted a different broader issue and frankly … it wasn’t really clear what locals could do if there was some disparity or discrepancy.”
The initial version of the legislation arose in response to a Carroll County school board decision to remove certain curriculum related to LGBTQ+ issues. The House has passed versions of the bill to boost instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation, but those efforts have fallen short in the Senate so far.
Minority Whip Justin Ready (R- Frederick and Carroll) said Thursday that he appreciated the changes to the bill, although he ultimately voted against it.
“I appreciate that this bill was not moved forward in the way that it came over, because as it was, I think it would not have been the right move for the state,” Ready said.
“The genesis of this legislation, which has been about an ongoing three-year saga, has been a disagreement about what’s appropriate for different age groups in the context of sexuality and family life,” Ready said. “Now the bill tried to do a lot of things that are not in the bill anymore …  I do appreciate that a very egregious part of the bill, which was going to try to say that parents couldn’t opt their children out of some of that instruction at all, was struck from this bill.”
Despite the heavy amendments, Senate Republicans still voted against the bill Thursday. It now goes back to the House, which will have to decide whether it will accept the changes and send it on to the governor, or let the bill die.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jheanelle-Wilkins-Eric-Carpenter-Grantham-and-Linda-Carpenter-Grantham-cropped-e1743753745317-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Photo by David Montgomery/Stateline)WATER VALLEY, Texas — On a recent day when the wind gusted close to 40 miles per hour, 82-year-old George Neill was making repairs on his ranch, oblivious to the nearby cluster of wind turbines churning the sky behind him.
“After about a year, you never know the things are here,” said Neill, who leases part of his West Texas property to an East Coast-based renewable energy company that placed three wind turbines on it four years ago.
Hundreds of other wind turbines stretch across this landscape, instantly visible to motorists traveling to nearby San Angelo and other towns. The turbines aren’t the only renewable energy producers amid the mesas: From a distance, a glistening array of solar panels resembles a small lake.
Texas is famous for producing oil and gas, but renewable energy has become deeply embedded in the state’s culture and economy. Texas led the nation in generating electricity from wind power and utility-scale solar power in 2023, and wind and solar energy projects contribute tax revenue to local governments and struggling school districts. Texas landowners are expected to receive nearly $30 billion in lease payments under current and expected projects, according to an industry study.
But in recent years, Texas has loosened its political embrace of alternative energy. For the second legislative session in a row, many Texas lawmakers are trying to derail or curb future renewable energy projects.
The shift is rooted in a number of a factors, including the second Trump administration’s antipathy toward renewables and an aggressive recommitment to fossil fuels in Texas energy policy. There is lingering concern over the reliability of the state’s electrical grid, after all types of power sources failed during a devastating 2021 winter storm. Some people object to the aesthetics of wind and solar farms, or note that turbines and panels can harm some wildlife.
Texas is not alone. Once focused on stopping individual projects at the local level, renewable energy opponents have been making inroads in other state legislatures, too. They have received backing from the oil and gas industry. And they’ve been galvanized by the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest-ever attempt to speed the transition to clean energy.
In neighboring Oklahoma, for example, hundreds of people rallied at the state Capitol in January to urge Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order halting new wind and solar projects. Like Texas, Oklahoma is a major oil and natural gas producer, but it generated 45% of its total in-state electricity from renewable resources in 2023.
Stitt, a strong supporter of renewable energy, is highly unlikely to issue such an order. But he will leave office in two years, and several Republicans discussed as possible successors appeared at the rally. One of them, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, last month on social media criticized what he called “the green energy scam” and urged Stitt and state lawmakers to tighten wind farm rules during the current session.
In Arizona, the House earlier this year approved a bill that would bar wind farm projects within a dozen miles of any property zoned for residential use — a restriction that would apply to about 90% of the land in the state, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.
In Ohio, a 2021 law allowing county commissioners to create restricted areas where utility-scale solar and wind projects can’t be built has had a huge impact, as 26 Ohio counties have banned renewable energy projects. This year, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation that would end all state solar subsidies.
And in Missouri, Republican legislators are pushing a bill that would raise taxes on farmers who lease their land for wind or solar energy projects.
The expanding opposition to renewables isn’t unexpected, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the power grid. He noted that wind, solar and battery storage have rapidly become the “cheapest way to put more energy on the grid.”
“They’re victims of their own success,” he told Stateline. “They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.”
 Opposing sides

At the center of the current debate in Texas is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican committee chair who has resurrected a 2023 bill that would require new utility-scale solar and wind projects to get permits from the state’s Public Utility Commission, regulations that aren’t imposed on projects for natural gas and other energy sources. The bill also calls for set-back requirements and cleanup funds.
Kolkhorst, in a statement to Stateline, called the legislation “a common-sense approach to the encroachment of wind and solar facilities being scattered across our great state with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment.”
At an hourslong Senate committee hearing recently where opponents of Kolkhorst’s bill outnumbered supporters, farmers, ranchers and small-town Texans sometimes found themselves on opposite sides, either arguing that sprawling wind farms and solar arrays are a lasting source of economic vitality or a threat to a beloved way of life.
“The land isn’t just a piece of property to us,” said Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County with her husband. “It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are. When we look out across the road, we see rolling green pastures and trees. Now we’re facing the possibility of that view and so much more being replaced by a sprawling solar farm.”
Environmentalists and industry representatives view Kolkhorst’s bill as a roadblock in the march toward green energy. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said the bill would open the door to “a really arbitrary discriminatory permitting regime,” requiring wind and solar developers to get permits that other energy producers do not have to have.
Describing herself as a “lifelong wildlife conservationist,” Kolkhorst said she introduced the bipartisan bill with nine other senators in an effort that “looks past the billions in wind and solar subsidies to instead focus on the total impact of these projects on our land, people and wildlife.”
But oil and gas projects also can harm wildlife, and scientists note that the emissions released by fossil fuels worsen climate change disasters.
Insiders following the legislation, including Metzger, identify one of the bill’s major supporters as Kolkhorst donor Dan Friedkin, a billionaire Houston businessman.
Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, is owner and CEO of The Friedkin Group, a consortium of businesses and investments that includes Gulf States Toyota. Gulf States is one of the world’s largest distributors of Toyota vehicles and parts, with exclusive rights to sell Toyotas in Texas and four other states. Gulf States Toyota Inc. State PAC made four donations totaling $42,500 to Kolkhorst from October of 2020 to October of 2024, according to the Texas Ethics Commission.
Friedkin is a stunt pilot and outdoorsman with a ranch in South Texas. Neither he nor his lobbyist, Laird Doran, senior vice president for public and legal affairs at The Friedkin Group, returned phone calls from Stateline.
Texas lawmakers have filed dozens of wind- and solar-related bills this session, including measures aimed at restricting the placement of battery storage facilities, curbing tax breaks and subsidies for renewable companies and limiting the amount of electricity solar and wind projects contribute to the state’s power grid.
Republican state Sen. Phil King, for example, is pushing a bill that would mandate that 50% of all new electricity must come from natural gas, nuclear or battery storage. King said solar and wind power should be part of the state’s energy mix, but he claims they aren’t reliable enough to serve as the foundation.
State Rep. Don McLaughlin, a Republican, has introduced legislation mandating a study of the economic impact of wind and solar projects on local communities, as well as noise and health effects, threats to wildlife and the challenges of disassembling worn-out systems. Sweetwater, Texas, has thousands of composite blades piled up in “a windmill graveyard.”
Rural support
But many rural GOP lawmakers whose districts long ago sprouted oil rigs and pump jacks are now strong supporters of wind and solar power.
“It’s nonstop windmills on both side of the road for 70 miles,” said state Rep. John Smithee of Amarillo, describing a typical drive from his hometown in the Texas Panhandle to the Capitol in Austin. “Almost all of those [constituents] have benefited.”
State Rep. Drew Darby, whose northwest Texas district includes San Angelo and Water Valley, an unincorporated community of around 300, said revenue from wind power has resulted in countywide improvements and lease payments to property owners.
“It’s been a positive impact on rural effectiveness,” said Darby. “Landowners … are receiving nice payments for leasing the property.”
In Water Valley, taxes from the increased revenue paved the way for a tax-free bond election that enabled the town’s K-12 school to add an upscale weight room, a technical educational facility and a “cafetorium” that serves as a dining room and performance hall. The school building had previously been so small that students had to eat in shifts.
The wind farm is expected to generate $123 million in local taxes over the 30-year life of the project, as well as more than $100 million in payments to landowners.
George Neill, the West Texas rancher, said he takes the wind turbines in stride as he roams across his 1,700-acre spread.
He’s not at liberty to reveal the amount of his payments. He’s not getting rich, he said, but the money “makes a difference when you’re trying run a ranch.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle) A finance-focused Senate panel excised a billboard-specific ban on marijuana advertising and regulations on towing services from the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles’s legislation Thursday morning — hours before the House advanced tweaked versions.
Commercial driver’s license (CDL) reciprocity also got the ax, with lawmakers citing immigration-related fears.
Appropriations Committee chair Sen. Ryan Mishler, said the marijuana and towing provisions were nixed — just a week after both were inserted — because they weren’t germane to the underlying agency bill. The edits were accepted by consent.
  Sen. Ryan Mishler explains a cost-cutting change in committee on Thursday, April 3, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But both ideas advanced in the House that same afternoon.
Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, commandeered Senate Bill 73 in a Monday committee hearing for amendments outlawing all marijuana advertising and regulating towing. He made further changes on the House floor Thursday — despite opposition from fellow Republicans — setting up a contentious vote as soon as next week.
Lawmakers cited illegal immigration as they scrapped a provision allowing CDL holders from other states to get Indiana CDLs without the written or skills exams.
“There are other states in our union that hand out driver’s licenses like candy,” said amendment author Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis. “… I’m fine if they follow the Indiana process to get a license. I am not fine if that process is California’s or New York’s or name your other state’s process, and I wanted to ensure that I didn’t have a non-citizen getting a license.”
Freeman promised to undo the change “if this needs to go back in.”
  Sen. Aaron Freeman speaks in committee on Thursday, April 3, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Pressel said CDL requirements are federal, describing them as another layer of standards that lie atop state mandates. He resisted the amendment, but added, “This is not a hill I’m going to die on. If you all would like to take it out, I’m okay with that.”
The committee adopted the changes by consent. But some expressed hesitation.
CDL holder Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond noted the tests take “a lot of time and money.”
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said her district is a major logistics hub, and would benefit from reciprocity.
She instructed her colleagues to “get this figured out.”
The committee advanced Senate Bill 1390 — sans deletions — on a 12-1 vote.

(Jonathan Kult | Wisconsin DNR)
As a teenager in the early 1970s, I recall listening to evening news broadcasts that featured smog reports, along with stories about nearby lakes and streams which pollution had rendered unfit for wildlife — and for humans. Responding to the urgency of that time, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, created the Environmental Protection Agency, and began 50 years of progress. These laws and the regulations that came with them required the clean-up of industrial processes, reduced auto emissions and drove energy efficiency. Our natural environment today is better because of it. 
President Trump has never supported policies related to environmental stewardship, let alone climate change. His actions since taking office were expected, but not at the speed and scale we are seeing. He is reneging on federal grants and loans for clean energy projects already appropriated by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA); firing Federal workers in the EPA, the Department of Energy, NOAA and more; and purging any mention of climate change from government websites. It’s as if his goal is to take us back 50 years to the pollution of my boyhood days.
President Trump’s approach amounts to a colossal strategic mistake for our country. As he and his loyal staff decimate our clean energy investments, European and Asian nations — particularly China – watch with glee. They realize the U.S. is ceding our chance to be a leader in the clean energy economy of the future. The drill-baby-drill mantra sounds catchy to some, but the facts are indisputable that burning fossil fuels is harmful to human health. And there is no question that the severity and number of extreme weather events is rising, shattering lives and costing hundreds of billions of dollars to clean up and rebuild. These are not Democrat or Republican issues; they affect us all and we should be motivated to address them instead of burying our future in fossil fuels.
You may wonder, “What can I do?” Contact your congressional representatives and tell them that the IRA should be left intact, especially the tax credits for clean energy. The IRA has incentivized hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy and manufacturing investments, 80% of which have flowed to “red” states. In Wisconsin, investments have been made in over 40 clean energy and manufacturing facilities totaling over $3.2 billion. In my rural congressional district alone, represented by U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, there are nine projects totaling $1.5 billion in investments, most of which is attributed to the Vista Sands solar project. On top of that, Dairyland Power received a $580 million Empowering Rural America (ERA) grant for clean energy projects.  Another 87 investments totaling $16.5 million have enabled clean energy projects like solar arrays for farmers, rural businesses and communities. And this doesn’t include the 30% tax credits these projects would also have filed for. Over 90 projects in less than two years benefiting our rural community: These are investments to be taken seriously.
Rather than labeling clean energy projects “the green new scam,” the Trump administration should embrace them as a key component of achieving “American energy dominance.” To meet the rapid growth in energy demand to boost domestic manufacturing and to help power AI and data centers, clean energy must be a part of the solution. 
The best way your legislators can serve you is to act in a bipartisan manner, especially when it comes to the environment. Like 50 years ago, urgent action is needed. Future generations of Americans depend on it.

Tim Sheehy, R-Montana, speaks to Kaitlan Collins on CNN about the Trump tariffs, confirming that Americans will feel economic pain (Screenshot CNN). There’s no other way to put it — the insane global tariff war Donald Trump started will have disastrous consequences for our country and international trade across the globe, a flood of which have already begun.  Yet, despite the widely-predicted impacts to many, if not all, of Montana’s economic and social sectors, our all-Republican congressional delegation somehow thinks their partisan loyalty to an arguably deranged president is more important than taking care of their constituents.
Let’s see, do Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, think the crashing global stock market is a wonderful thing for Montanans’ retirement investments?  The crashing is indisputable — the DOW dropped a stunning 1,600 points at its first opening after Trump’s tariff tragedy struck.
Yet, all four of these mighty MAGA warriors are as quiet as church mice, hiding in their Congressional offices instead of exercising their Constitutionally-established function as a separate-but-equal branch of government providing checks and balances on executive excesses.  
And make no mistake, this executive is setting new records for abuse of power and lack of respect for and adherence to the Constitution.  Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution vests the power to lay and collect tariffs with Congress...not the Oval Office. 
Which begs the question — why oh why would Montana’s congressional delegation willingly give up that authority when dire consequences for their own constituents are at stake?  
Given that a huge chunk of Montana’s economy is directly dependent upon agricultural production — and the ability to sell those products internationally — who would ever cede control over that complex web of global trade to a guy whose apparent understanding of agricultural production is: “Groceries.  It’s such an old-fashioned term, but a beautiful term: groceries. It sort of says a bag with different things in it.” Or, in his more detailed explanation: “The word ‘grocery,’ it’s a sort of simple word.  But it sort of means, like, everything you eat.” 
For someone who doesn’t even understand what groceries are, how can we expect him to understand that almost everything in every hardware and appliance store in the U.S. is “Made in China” when he slaps a 34% tariff on those imports?  When do you figure the last time Trump bought a garden hose, a dishwasher, refrigerator or even a screwdriver?  “Never” would be the right answer.  And that says nothing about parts for your cars, trucks, tractors, backhoes, appliances…you know, the necessities of life, particularly in a rural state like Montana. 
It’s worth remembering that our GOP delegation has made cutting taxes one of their primary goals.  Yet, according to economists, the new tariff war will be the single largest tax increase on Americans in the last 30 years and “will cost American importers about $2.1 trillion in additional taxes over the next decade, costs that are passed along to consumers, according to a Tax Foundation estimate.”
GOP Sen. Rand Paul has already predicted the tariffs will result in the “decimation” of the Republican Party.  If Montana’s congressional delegation won’t stand up for their constituents as the mass layoffs, price increases, market crashes and economic uncertainty ravage the nation, maybe they’ll at least act to preserve their own political party.  
The Trade Review Act of 2025 has already been introduced in reaction to the Trump tariff disaster.  Montana’s Congressional delegation must cease silently kneeling at the MAGA throne and support this bill to restore limits on a president’s ability to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval — or give up the phony charade of protecting the future for Montanans and our nation.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sheehy-CNN.png,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The countdown to the end of the 2025 legislative session is on. Following a weeklong recess, Arkansas lawmakers hit the ground running Monday as they returned to the state Capitol focused on wrapping up their work by April 16. 
The 11th week of the session saw continued progress on Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ legislative priorities, including immigration. A Senate committee on Monday approved a bill to impose harsher penalties on undocumented immigrants who commit violent crimes. The full Senate sent the bill to a House committee Wednesday. 
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives approved legislation to overhaul the state employee pay plan, another Sanders priority. The bill was sent to the governor’s desk for her signature. 
Sanders this week unveiled two new bills aimed at expanding social media protections for children, which was a priority in the 2023 session. Wednesday’s announcement came two days after a federal judge declared unconstitutional an Arkansas law requiring age verification for new social media accounts.
Beyond the governor’s priorities, the subject matter of lawmakers’ bills varied widely as they rushed to push their legislation through in the waning days of the session. 
Proposals included potentially removing an environmental permit moratorium intended to protect the Buffalo River watershed, preventing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding permits to operate drug stores, clarifying state public meetings law, adjusting asset limits for Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries and prohibiting youth organizations that promote diversity initiatives from receiving certain state grants.

1) Prison funding
The third time was not the charm for a $750 million prison appropriation bill that was thrice rejected by the Arkansas Senate this week. Senate Bill 354 would support construction of a 3,000-bed Franklin County prison that supporters have said is needed to address overcrowding in county jails. 
The project has caused controversy since local residents and elected officials said they were blindsided by the governor’s announcement of the project in late October. Opponents, including state lawmakers, have fought against the proposal for months. Within the Senate this week, support for SB 354 fluctuated between 19 affirmative votes on Tuesday and Thursday, and 18 on Wednesday.
While that’s a majority of the 35 senators, appropriation bills require 27 votes to advance out of the Senate. There is no limit to how many times lawmakers can vote on an appropriation bill, but they only have until the end of the session to send bills to the governor for final approval. 
It’s unclear if there’s yet a clear path to securing the needed votes by the end of the session, but Corning Republican Sen. Blake Johnson asked his colleagues Wednesday to try and find consensus.
“I appreciate everybody’s differences, but please let’s try to work together for the safety of Arkansas citizens,” Johnson said. 
2) Religious freedom 
Legislation that sponsors said aim to protect Arkansans’ religious freedoms have been popping up on committee agendas in recent weeks. 
The House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday advanced House Bill 1615, which would “prohibit the government from discriminating against certain individuals and organizations because of their beliefs regarding marriage or what it means to be female or male.” The House on Thursday approved the bill, which will next be considered by a Senate committee.

House Bill 1669, which had similar language regarding the “sincerely held religious beliefs” of parents seeking to foster or adopt children in Arkansas, failed in the Senate Monday. The bill’s sponsors, Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville and Sen. Alan Clark of Lonsdale, said it would protect parents who don’t accept LGBTQ+ children’s identities from not being allowed to foster or adopt.
Searcy Republican Jonathan Dismang, who noted Monday that not all “sincerely held religious beliefs” are Christian, said HB 1669 would set a “dangerous precedent” by shielding foster or adoptive parents from adverse government action if their faith-based actions harm children. 
But the bill received enough support to pass the Senate on Thursday and was sent back to a House committee that will consider an amendment made in the Senate.  
3) Library board
A bill to abolish the Arkansas State Library and its board advanced out of committee Tuesday before narrowly passing the Senate on Wednesday. 
Jonesboro Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan has promised to dissolve the board for some time. With Senate Bill 536 he broadened his intention to eliminate the entire State Library after the board last month did not satisfy the conditions he gave them for its survival. 
One of those requests was to detach from the American Library Association. Sullivan has criticized a section of the ALA’s Library Bill of Rights that says access to libraries should not be restricted based on a person’s age. Far-right conservatives who object to the public availability of certain content have claimed this proves ALA believes in forcing sexual activity and LGBTQ+ topics onto children.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)
While testifying against SB 536 in committee this week, Clare Graham, library director of the Mid-Arkansas Regional Library System, said the bill’s “one-size-fits-all approach” will stifle creativity and flexibility for local libraries.
“Local libraries are already governed by their local boards that know their communities best,” Graham said. “This bill takes that away, replacing it with centralized oversight that doesn’t understand the unique needs of each town and city.”
SB 536 will next be considered by a House committee.
4) New Bills
Arkansas lawmakers filed about 150 new bills this week. Nearly half were filed Monday as legislators rushed to submit their proposals in what they hope is enough time to make it through the process to become law before their April 16 deadline. Those bills included: 
Senate Bill 591 by Sen. Clint Penzo, R-Springdale, would prohibit a physician or other person from intentionally performing or attempting to perform an abortion with the knowledge that the pregnant woman is seeking the abortion solely based on race. Arkansas law already bans all abortions except to save the life of the mother.
House Bill 1909 by Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, would require state agencies to verify that adults who apply for federal, state or local public benefits are U.S. citizens who reside in Arkansas, except if prohibited by federal law.  
House Bill 1980 by Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, would create the Technology and Energy for Sustainable Logistics Act (TESLA), and add electric vehicle charging stations to the definition of critical infrastructure. 
House Bill 1985 by Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, would create the Arkansas Renter Refund Act, and provide a $500 income tax credit for certain renters. 
Despite the deadline pressure, lawmakers are taking Friday off. When they return to the Capitol early Monday morning, they’ll have roughly seven working days to finish their work. Meeting schedules, agendas and livestreams are available on the Arkansas Legislature’s website.

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.

Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
‘None of them are equitable’
In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”
Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
Economic anchors
There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.
Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”
For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

Michigan posted the largest unemployment rate jump among the 50 states over the past 12 months, the Detroit News recently reported, citing federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
The state’s jobless rate rose 1.4 percentage points between February 2024 and last February, the latest month available. The increase exceeded that of second-place Mississippi, which has long been one of the poorest states in the country.
Michigan’s 5.4% unemployment rate in February was second only to Nevada’s 5.8% jobless rate. The state’s unemployment rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than the nation’s 4.1% rate, and the gap has steadily widened over the past year.
But other data paint a somewhat brighter picture of the state’s economy, although they show a slowdown in hiring over the past year. Businesses added 35,000 nonfarm jobs between February 2024 and last February, according to state statistics. Michigan employers also posted 168,285 jobs online in February, although the number was down 2% from January.
The state’s unemployment rate is based on a monthly survey of households while the number of payroll jobs is based on a separate survey of businesses.
People are losing jobs through layoffs, of course. But the unemployment rate also is rising because a surprising number of people entered the job market and couldn’t find employment. Michigan’s labor force has grown by 64,000 over the past 12 months to 5.1 million, while 70,000 people reported being unemployed in February.
University of Michigan economist Don Grimes, who has been forecasting the state’s economy for decades, said the growth in the labor force is notable because of Michigan’s graying population.
“This is a much bigger increase than we understand,” Grimes told me. “Given the aging of the population I would have expected (the size of the labor force) to be trending down, but so far it hasn’t.”
Meanwhile the increased number of payroll jobs over the past year shows Michigan’s economy performed “relatively well,” Grimes said, although manufacturing shed 11,000 jobs.
Grimes regards the payroll data as more reliable than the household survey, but the gap between the two “makes assessing the state’s economy very hard.”
That could become much easier in the months ahead, but in a very negative way.
Experts say President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announced Wednesday are likely to hike prices on just about everything Americans buy, risking a deep recession. And as the old saying goes, when the nation catches a cold, Michigan catches pneumonia.
Michigan is expected to be one of the hardest-hit states because of 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. Even U.S.-assembled vehicles will be subject to tariffs because their parts come from many countries.
Detroit automakers won some relief from tariffs on cars and trucks they import from Mexico and Canada. Those vehicles that comply with the terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement are exempt from the tariffs, for now.
But Trump said tariffs on parts components in Canadian-and-Mexican-made vehicles will take effect after the Commerce Department “establishes a process to apply tariffs to their non-U.S. content.”
The tariff exemptions on many vehicles imported from our northern and southern trading partners is cold comfort to Michigan auto industry leaders who warn that tariff-induced costs to Detroit automakers will rise substantially and be passed on to consumers.
“These increased vehicle costs will be disproportionately borne by working-class and middle-class families,” Detroit Regional Chamber President Sandy Baruah and MichAuto Executive Director Glenn Stevens wrote in a letter to Trump administration officials.
Experts say vehicles prices, which are expected to jump by thousands of dollars because of the tariffs, will likely reduce demand for new cars and trucks. And that could lead to lower vehicle production and fewer jobs.
U-M economists were predicting a significant slowdown in Michigan’s economy over the next two years even before the April 3 tariffs took effect.
In a February 28 forecast, the economists said they expected the state to gain 30,200 jobs this year, down from 38,100 last year. Job growth further decelerates in 2026 with the economy producing just 18,500 jobs, according to the U-M forecast.
The major culprit in the jobs malaise is manufacturing, particularly in the auto sector. U-M economists expect the auto and parts manufacturing to lose about 9,000 jobs over the next two years.
Most of the state’s job growth through 2026 is expected to be in service jobs least affected by tariffs.
Trump’s tariffs could greatly accelerate the predicted loss of auto-related and other manufacturing jobs. U-M expects new steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect last month, to result in the loss of 2,300 auto-related jobs by the end of 2026.
U.S. steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs last month cut 600 jobs in Michigan, citing falling automotive demand.
One of the few people who think the tariffs will be a jobs boon is United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain, who said Detroit automakers will be forced to bring back to the U.S. jobs that left in droves to Mexico and other low-wage countries. to the U.S.
In a statement, the UAW said automakers could return thousands of jobs to the U.S. in a matter of months by adding production to underutilized plants.
But many experts say it would take years for automakers to build new plants that would substantially increase manufacturing employment in the U.S.
Michigan will be at the epicenter of Trump’s risky experiment to reorder the global manufacturing footprint. Buckle up.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)When it comes to health, we are all connected. Health policies that impact some can ultimately affect the health of the whole community.
House Bill 135, which imposes citizenship verification requirements for certain benefits like immunizations, testing for communicable diseases, prenatal care, and services like food and shelter, has passed the Idaho Legislature and now goes to the governor. Even though this bill aims to deter illegal immigration, it is just as likely to limit benefits to U.S. citizens and endanger the public’s health.
Idaho Legislature passes bill blocking unauthorized immigrants from public services

The country is facing outbreaks of syphilis, measles and tuberculosis. If we can’t screen and treat infectious diseases in our communities, we put everyone’s health at risk. That’s why we don’t require onerous citizenship documentation for these basic activities, even as immigrants are already blocked from receiving most public benefits and health coverage.
Idahoans value babies getting a healthy start in life, so we have similar exceptions for some pre- and post-natal care and nutrition programs regardless of the mom’s immigration status. The citizenship verification requirements in House Bill 135 could block pregnant women from receiving services that prevent pregnancy and labor complications, as well as birth defects. This policy could have severe and long-lasting consequences for Idaho families.
Some Idaho citizens may not have the required identification handy when they show up to the soup kitchen, the health department, or the mental health crisis center, so House Bill 135 would affect citizens and noncitizens alike. Under this bill, every single Idahoan receiving these services would have to jump through onerous hoops or may be blocked from services even if they are eligible.
Despite health and public health professionals’ warnings, over the past few years the Legislature has passed bills with adverse, unintended consequences to the health of Idahoans. This bill could be one of them.
Besides the issues above, legislators must consider the potential cost of training people on citizenship verification and setting up systems to carry out this task in the various areas impacted by this bill. There is also the cost to frontline providers, who would have to deal with the added bureaucracy and the distress of having to deny services to people in need.
Immigration is an issue that requires addressing, but this is not the way to do it — and certainly not a thoughtful, compassionate way to do it. House Bill 135 endangers the health of families, children and vulnerable people.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee lawmakers are hung up on hemp, Memphis schools and immigrant kids as they try to hustle home before being called to testify at an April 22 corruption trial.
Versions of the hemp restriction bill passed Senate and House finance committees this week but with major differences ranging from state regulation and taxes to the little elephant in the room, THCA, a derivative that delivers a high similar to marijuana when decarboxylated (lit). 
The Tennessee Journal reported that the House bill could add considerably more than the Senate bill to state coffers through taxes and fees on hemp products. Extra money could be critical as lawmakers maneuver in the closing days, especially since lawmakers want to put their own pet projects in the state budget instead of the governor’s. The Senate version nets only about $14 million extra in taxes and fees, but it also bans THCA while the House version keeps the buzz factor intact.
Memphis-Shelby schools “takeover” starts in Tennessee subcommittee

In addition to wrangling over near-weed as the kickback trial for former Speaker Glen Casada and ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren approaches, a state takeover of Memphis Shelby County Schools is hitting obstacles with the Senate balking at a plan for the state to appoint a management board to run the school district, superseding the elected school board and administration there. Leadership is not enthused with the idea of putting a board in place that could come back to haunt them, similarly to the Achievement School District, which was deemed a relative failure after 10 years and roughly a billion dollars flushed down the drain.
The Senate bill is wide ranging but a watered-down version of House Education Committee Chairman Mark White’s effort to put a state-appointed board in charge of the school district he says has struggled for decades without direction.
The Senate version allows Tennessee’s education commissioner, with approval from the Department of Education, to remove the schools director or school board members and allow the county commission to replace them. If a school district runs through three district directors in three years, a county mayor could appoint a new director for a four-year term.
The bill also would lift income caps on the Education Savings Account program in effect in Shelby County, the governor’s initial private-school voucher program, and change the process for a public school to become a charter school.
Sounds like a complete face-lift for Memphis public schools.
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis, who is carrying the Senate version, predicted the bills would go to a conference committee where differences could be worked out. 
Then again, some bills that wind up in negotiations fail to gain enough traction for passage.
Lawmakers could get stuck, as well, on restricting immigrant children in K-12 schools. The Senate bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Bo Watson of Chattanooga/Hixson would require immigration status checks on students and allow school districts the option to deny children without legal status the chance to go to school or charge their families tuition.

Watson, chairman of the Senate finance committee, made a powerpoint presentation this week displaying how costly it is to teach immigrant children. 
Because of this bill and federal deportation efforts, some already under way, immigrant parents might be keeping kids at home, potentially creating another underclass when, in reality, the kids are just as smart as anyone else, maybe smarter.
The House bill’s biggest contrast is that it gives school districts the option to check immigration status, bound to be a sticking point over the next two weeks and putting the bill in position to go through negotiations – or nowhere.
State troopers removed opponents of the bill from the Senate’s committee meeting room this week, including 80-year-old Lynne McFarland, who looked quite comfortable in the arms of a Tennessee patrol officer. She was later jailed for allegedly disturbing the meeting.
In light of the photo taken by the Tennessee Lookout’s John Partipilo, the idea was floated for installation of conveyor belts in committee rooms, enabling protesters and others wrongly accused of making noise to be loaded up and moved out. We don’t need our troopers straining their backs and making needless worker’s comp claims – especially over unconstitutional bills that are designed to challenge Supreme Court precedent but are more likely to dredge up old prejudices.
A bill for big business
Typically, you’re supposed to give a nod to the golf gods before making a backswing. At least that’s what Kevin Costner said in “Tin Cup.” 
In the legislature’s case, it’s giving a nod to the business gods, those who make big contributions to campaign accounts. 
Case in point, the Senate voted 21-7 Thursday to pass the Bayer/Monsanto bill enabling companies to dodge liability in case a farmer contracts cancer after spreading the company’s Roundup, all based, of course, on the product’s label. The company is facing more than 170,000 lawsuits over its product, and Germany-based Bayer, the parent company of Monsanto, recently agreed to pay nearly $2.1 billion to a man who claimed he contracted non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma from Roundup.
Oddly enough, the Farm Bureau and farmers, even though they are more likely to get sick from the pesticide/herbicide, support the bill because the stuff they spray on plants and weeds is said to enable them to farm larger tracts more efficiently. 
The bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. John Stevens of Huntingdon, read a letter Thursday from former U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher of Frog Jump who claimed farmers need “common-sense protections” to be able to spray the stuff, which has gone through “rigorous” testing with the U.S. Environmental Protection as the “gold standard.” Oh yes, and without the fear of political motivation.



Whaddya know! Sen. John Stevens, a Huntingdon Republican and sponsor of a bill holding Bayer — the German based parent company of Monsanto — harmless for cancer caused by the company’s products, has taken $12,000 from both Bayer and a lobbying firm that represents — you guessed it — Bayer. 			


It’s always funny to hear lawmakers brag about the federal government on one hand and then kick it around when convenient.
Stevens received $12,000 from Bayer over the past five years and $15,000 from BIV-PAC, a lobbying firm’s political action committee. The Farm Bureau is playing a heavy role in this semi-fight too.
Democrats spoke against the bill Thursday morning, with Sen. Heidi Campbell calling it “crazy” to protect big chemical companies instead of the rights of people to sue over products that darn near kill them.
Stevens countered by saying consumers can continue to sue but not over the product’s label. This means we’re depending on the EPA and the manufacturer to do the right thing and not put cancer-causing chemicals on the market.
But as long as we can get a few more bushels of corn per acre, does it really matter?
Incidentally, along with Democrats, Republican Sens. Rusty Crowe and Janice Bowling voted against the bill while Sens. Mark Pody and Kerry Roberts were present not voting, which equals a no vote. It takes a lot of people to die before you can find nine votes in the Senate.
Out of existence
The late, great Richard Stockard (my father) was ahead of his time and didn’t know it. An English and Spanish teacher for nearly 35 years, he called all students by their last name. He also employed the paddle frequently to send a message, although in later years after softening up, he would simply kick unruly students out of class, then go out and paddle the bottom of his shoe to make a lot of noise and then tell them to act like they were hurting. Those scare tactics never worked with me.
Anyway, using students’ last names made it easier to remember everyone years afterward, and he never had to worry about using pronouns, which has reached epidemic proportions in Tennessee, to the point we need state laws to make sure boys are referred to as “he” and girls are called “she.” Thank you, Archie Bunker.
And with a nod to Archie (there we go nodding again), the Senate passed SB937 Thursday making sure people such as teachers can’t be sued for using or refusing to use names or pronouns that don’t match a student’s sex at birth. The bill also allows civil suits to be filed against employers and public schools that allow a student’s preferred pronoun to be used without parental permission.
  A solution in search of a problem: A bill proposed by Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican, would make educators liable for using a student’s preferred pronouns. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Does that mean it’s OK to refer to a girl as “he,” as long as parents approve, but that parental permission means nothing when it comes to gender affirming care? I reckon so.
Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville argued during Thursday’s debate that the bill, if it becomes law, and it probably will, will “create more fights.”
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Paul Rose of Covington, countered by saying today’s youths have been led to believe there are more than two sexes created by God and that they can change the sex from which they were born. 
“This is common-sense legislation,” Rose said.
Inside and outside the chamber, we could detect the faint sound of Tennessee’s government slowly, but surely, expanding. And you know what that means: Don’t call me Shirley. But if you do, make sure you use “she” or you’ll wind up in court.
“We’re gonna have a party, y’all”
Fresh off a two-week prison sentence that morphed downward from 21 months, thanks to President Donald Trump, former state Sen. Brian Kelsey is holding (yes, you guessed it) a pardon party.
The crack investigative reporters with the Tennessee Journal unearthed an invitation from the former Germantown Republican for a party this weekend to celebrate his pardon. No doubt, the president will attend since birds of a feather flock together?
It’s always nice to see happy endings.
But what we have here is a case in which Kelsey funneled more than $80,000 from his state campaign account through two political action committees to the American Conservative Union, which paid for ads to bolster his flagging 2016 congressional run, which flopped. 
  Ain’t no party like a pardon party: Former Sen. Brian Kelsey, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations, celebrations his get-out-of-jail-free card.
It might be a bad law, but it’s illegal to use state funds for a federal campaign because they’re gathered under different rules.
Kelsey knew it was wrong and pleaded guilty but then had what “alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity” and decided he didn’t break the law and was given bad advice by his attorneys. He claimed he was also affected by the birth of twin sons and the looming death of his father, both of which are stressful (not joking). But he also said he didn’t understand criminal law, even though he earned a law degree from Georgetown and served as Senate Judiciary chairman. But enough background.
Kelsey had $197,519 in his state account before transferring it to his Red State Political Action Committee on June 1, 2023. His PAC received $1,000 from the Haile PAC of Sen. Ferrell Haile last year and $250 from the Faison Freedom PAC of Rep. Jeremy Faison, in addition to transferring $15,000 to a federal PAC account.
The Registry of Election Finance wouldn’t let him use his state funds to pay legal fees. But he might be able to use that money to finance this weekend’s party. That is, if he pretends to be running for re-election after receiving a full pardon, which would, presumably, allow him to renew voting and gun-carry rights.
Sounds like a lot of fun. Too bad I didn’t get an invitation. Maybe former, expelled Rep. Jeremy Durham, an unnamed conspirator in the case, got one. Psyche.

(Chris Jackson | West Virginia Watch)While facing the huge uncertainty around proposed federal cuts to food banks, SNAP and school feeding programs, county officials have been sounding the alarm that if their county jail bills keep increasing, they do not know how their counties can afford funding popular, non-mandated services like senior centers and food banks. 
Instead of taking seriously these fiscal concerns raised by county officials, state lawmakers have been moving legislation that would make the problem of hefty jail bills tremendously worse, funnel millions more dollars into the failed war on drugs, while providing no additional funding for prevention and treatment programs proven to work.
Senate Bill 196, which has already passed the Senate, proposes 21 increased penalties for drug offenses when the research is clear that higher penalties will not deter drug trafficking or reduce the demand for drugs.  
Not only are policies like SB 196 fiscally irresponsible, but according to recent polling data, they’re also very unpopular among West Virginia voters. 
SB 196 was rushed through the Senate under a false narrative that it solely targets fentanyl, when the truth is that SB 196 would triple the minimum time a person must serve in prison from one year to three years, for drug offenses that do not include fentanyl.
Let that sink in. SB 196 would triple the minimum incarceration time for drug offenses like possession with intent to deliver, the most common drug offense, which most often ensnares people suffering from substance use disorder.
SB 196 will have a major impact on our state budget due to the increased mandatory minimum prison sentences, and the biggest financial hit will be felt directly by counties. Higher penalties will result in higher bonds, which will lead to more people spending more days incarcerated pretrial, which are per diem days paid for by the county.

While all 55 counties can expect jail bills to increase if SB 196 passes, and all tax payers can expect to pay millions more for prison costs, it’s the poorest counties who stand to lose the most. 
Take for example Clay County, home county of the Speaker of the House of Delegates. Clay County has the smallest budget in the state ($1.7 million). According to analysis of Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation data by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, last year Clay County used 286.3 percent of its allotted jail days, resulting in a jail bill that was equal to 39.9 percent of the county’s total budget. Currently, Clay County has a jail bill debt that is roughly twice the value of its annual budget. SB 196 is poorly considered policy that would break the budgets of our poorest counties. 
Recent polling conducted by pollster Mark Blankenship also reveals significant concern among voters regarding increasing criminal penalties and incarceration costs. Nearly 6 in 10 Republicans in West Virginia believe it is important to reduce the jail and prison population in the state. The results are not surprising as they come at a time when the state is spending more to incarcerate a single person annually than the average income for someone working in the state, costing taxpayers over $420 million on its prisons and jails during the 2024 fiscal year.
Some other highlights from the poll include:

Voters believe the best way to keep West Virginia communities safe is through investment in prevention, housing, job training, and drug and mental health treatment (65%) rather than increased jail and prison sentences (32%).  
Six in 10 voters support reducing criminal penalties for possession of controlled substances and treating drug use as a public health issue, including a majority (56%) of Republicans.
Six in 10 Republicans support eliminating mandatory minimums for drug offenses.

SB 196 and bills like it threaten to undo some of the progress the legislature has made in recent years prioritizing treatment and reducing barriers to reentry. West Virginians agree: If our lawmakers want to be tough on crime, then they should spend our tax dollars on prevention and treatment, not on more of the same failed and costly policies of the past.

Andy Beshear almost two years ago as they briefed media on the mass shooting at the Old National Bank on April 10, 2023 in Louisville. (Photo by Michael Swensen/Getty Images)Two years ago, on April 10, a mentally unstable 25-year-old walked into Old National Bank in Louisville and shot five people to death — Thomas Elliott, James Tutt Jr., Juliana Farmer, Joshua Barrick, Deana Eckert — and injured eight, including Nickolas Wilt, a young police officer who was shot in the head and miraculously survived.
Two years ago, Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at University of Louisville Hospital, called on lawmakers to address gun violence. “To everyone who helps make policy, both at state, city, (and) federal levels – I would simply ask you to do something. Because doing nothing — which is what we’ve been doing — is not working.”
Two years later, Kentucky’s powerful GOP supermajority has still done absolutely nothing.
In the closing hours of the 2025 General Assembly, during which they did not so much as breathe the words “gun violence” or “firearm safety,” Rep. Bill Wesley appeared outside a women’s restroom to tackle what he clearly believes is the real threat to public safety: a drag queen standing outside the women’s restroom. 
Why? Because Republicans know what sells. They know the sick curiosity about what’s between someone’s legs – not real issues like gun deaths – is political gold.
For all the talk of Democrats running recently on “the trans issue” (a wholly made-up thing) this has been a GOP-instigated rallying cry from the start. Republicans, in the summer of 2022, suddenly found themselves desperately in need of a new culture war strategy.
The overturning of Roe v. Wade left Republicans across the country flat-footed as they lost the one issue they could count on, the battering ram they’d used for decades to drive donations and voters to the polls. With abortion suddenly illegal in many states, including Kentucky, they needed a new cudgel, a sure thing to get and keep voters’ attention, and they found it — akin to the issue of pregnancy and abortion — in the curiosity of what goes on between people’s legs.
  Rep. TJ Robert posted on X. (Screenshot)
If this sounds blunt or sick or crass to you, it’s because it is. 
It is also the truth.
The morning after Wesley bullied a trans woman outside the women’s restroom — and that is what he did, bullied someone with no power for show — the story, along with video and photos, was all over social media. 
Wesley’s buddies in the House publicly cheered him on. Rep. Ryan Dotson wrote on Facebook, “I’m so proud of State Representative Bill Wesley as he protected 2 young girls and their mother from going in to the Women’s restroom after a man dressed like a woman goes in,” and Rep. TJ Roberts posted on X, “Very thankful for KSP and @realBillWesley for keeping women and girls safe today!”
Wesley now says he will “introduce legislation banning men from using women’s restrooms at the state Capitol following an incident involving a transgender woman in Frankfort.” 
Wow! Look at how fast they can decide to file a bill when it is politically expedient.
Meanwhile, Everytown for Gun Safety reports that an average of 842 Kentuckians die each year from gun violence, at a cost of $9.6 billion each year. But what do we hear, year after year, from Wesley and his chest-pounding, gotta-protect-the-women-folk colleagues on gun violence prevention? Crickets.
As if bullying a Capitol visitor outside the women’s restroom was not enough, Wesley and others made more hay, claiming on social media that he was slapped by state Sen. Karen Berg after they exchanged words about the incident. 
I admit, I was appalled when I first read this, imagining Sen. Berg slapping him in the face, because isn’t that what a slap is? This rumor spread like wildfire.
The problem is that it wasn’t exactly true.
Berg did not slap Wesley on the face. After talking to him, she slapped him on the back of his shoulder as she was walking away. For this – for this! – House Speaker David Osborne permanently banned her from the House floor. 
When I was at church on Sunday, our retired office manager did exactly the same to me as she walked by my pew. “Good to see you!” she said as she passed by, slapping me twice on the back of my shoulder. Did I post all over social media that I was slapped at church? Should my minister ban this woman from church? Of course not. Because that would be ridiculous.
And that is what the entire Bill Wesley incident has been — ridiculous — but it sure has gotten him a lot of attention.
Two years have passed since the Old National Bank mass shooting. 
Two years since Dr. Smith addressed the media. “To be honest with you, we barely had to adjust our operating room schedule to be able to do this. That’s how frequent we are having to deal with gun violence in our community,” he said. “I’ll tell you personally, I’m weary. … I’m more than tired, I’m weary. There’s only so many times you can walk into a room and tell someone their (loved one)] is not coming home tomorrow. And it just breaks your heart when you hear someone screaming mommy, or daddy, it just becomes too hard, day in and day out, to be able to do that.”
Two years.
And what have our lawmakers — our powerful Republican supermajority — done to address Dr. Smith’s concerns? Not one damn thing. They are too busy touting their sick obsession with genitalia because that is what brings in the donations and brings out their voting base.
Need proof?
Hours after the 2025 General Assembly ended, after he and others had been wildly posting and making hay of his dramatic bathroom brouhaha, Rep. Bill Wesley posted on his Facebook page, “I came home from a good session being in Frankfort, and to come home to find out that the Democrat party is already sending out somebody door knocking to have me replaced. I didn’t even get home to rest any (sic) But so be it, let the race begin. If anybody wants to give to my campaign, I would greatly appreciate it. Just hit on the link below. It’s called Win Red. Thank you.”
Rep. Bill Wesley was not protecting women and girls at our state Capitol; he was not slapped in the face by a female senator; he went viral on social media and then asked for donations to his campaign.
The Kentucky GOP proves year after year after year that they do not care one bit about your safety from real threats like gun violence.
They care about what gets your attention.
They care about what brings in the money honey, so they can be reelected and keep their supermajority and do absolutely nothing again next year.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide.
A newly surfaced recording of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is drawing sharp criticism from Democrats and federal employee unions, who say her remarks downplaying the impact of recent federal layoffs show a disregard for the thousands of Virginians — many of them veterans — who have lost their jobs under President Donald Trump’s administration’s workforce cuts.
In the clip, released last week by the progressive media outlet Meidas Touch, Earle-Sears is heard downplaying concerns from federal workers about job losses tied to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has already axed more than 6,000 veterans and is on track to cut at least 80,000 VA employees nationwide, according to the Associated Press.
In the recording, which appears to be from a March 13 gathering, Earle-Sears addresses the recent federal layoffs tied to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 
“Now I’m hearing about DOGE and all of that,” she begins, before quickly shifting to a broader defense of Virginia’s job market. She insists that “we don’t want folks to lose their jobs,” but points to what she says are “over 250,000 jobs that we’ve created since we’ve been in office” as evidence of economic strength.
Earle-Sears then pivots to suggest that job loss is a common experience, asking the crowd, “How many here have ever lost a job?” When some respond affirmatively, she continues: “Oh, you mean it’s not unusual? It happens to everybody all the time? Okay.” She concludes by criticizing the media coverage surrounding the layoffs, saying, “The media is making it out to be this huge, huge thing. And I don’t understand why.”
The reaction from union officials and political opponents was swift.
“She was caught on tape saying she doesn’t know why this is a huge deal,” said Christine Surette, national vice president for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) District 4 and a former VA employee. 
“I’ve had to console employees who were laid off, who don’t know how they’ll make rent. Some have taken their own lives. Sears isn’t on the side of Virginians,” Surette said on a Zoom call set up by the Democratic Party of Virginia Thursday. 
Earle-Sears, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran herself, is currently leading the pack in the Republican gubernatorial primary and has leaned heavily into her alignment with Gov. Glenn Youngkin and, despite disavowing him more than two years ago, Trump. 
The layoffs, which have significantly affected Virginia’s large population of veteran federal employees, are part of a broader federal workforce reduction effort launched under Trump’s second-term agenda of fiscal reset.
A spokeswoman for Earle-Sears’ campaign declined to comment, but pointed to a video the lieutenant governor posted on X, formerly Twitter, in February, where she expressed empathy for federal workers facing layoffs.
“I have been in your shoes and I totally understand what it is to not know how the next paycheck is coming,” Earle-Sears said in the video. “I know it from being an employee and I also know it from being a small business owner, and so I want to say this to you that we see you.”
At the same time, she reaffirmed her support for Trump’s efforts to cut federal spending — even if it results in job losses. 
“Our government, without question, owes us answers to how the money is being spent,” she said. “We work very hard for those dollars in order for the government to tax us, and so the government must be accountable to us and tell us how it is spending our hard earned dollars.”
Earle-Sears added that it’s also important to ensure support is available for those who lose their jobs and want to pursue new opportunities. 
“It is also a given that we want to make sure that you have the money that you need to find a job or if you want to start a new career or even to go into business and how to do that,” she said.
Earle-Sears went on to promote Youngkin’s plan to connect laid-off federal employees with new job opportunities in Virginia.
But her critics say the damage is done.
“She’s talking about someone’s life being turned upside down,” said Monique Samuels, president of AFGE Local 1992, which represents Defense Logistics Agency workers in Richmond. “Losing a job in any situation is devastating. With thousands of Virginians facing layoffs, there will be a larger economic impact that will hurt every Virginian, but Sears doesn’t care.”
The layoffs have already disrupted essential services at facilities like the Hampton VA Medical Center, where 12 employees initially lost their jobs although one later was allowed to return, and the soon-to-open clinic in Chesapeake, where local lawmakers are already raising concerns about staffing levels. 
“We were struggling before,” said Sheila Elliott, president of AFGE Local 2328. “We’re already seeing appointments being rescheduled because doctors and nurses can’t do their jobs because they don’t have the tools that they need to get that job done. Yesterday we received 50 messages, people are worried about what’s happening next.”
Former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, also weighed in.
“Virginia’s federal employees are real people with real bills to pay,” she said in a statement. “Now is not the time for the lieutenant governor to put blind ideology and allegiance to a political party ahead of the livelihoods of our neighbors and the strength of Virginia’s economy.”
Virginia is home to the Pentagon, multiple military bases and one of the highest veteran populations nationwide. Many of those veterans transition into federal civilian roles after their service — jobs that have become increasingly precarious as DOGE enacts mass terminations in the name of “efficiency.”
“I understand firsthand the importance of ensuring that our VAs are fully staffed and prepared to care for and support the men and women who have served our country. And right now, that’s all at risk,” said Ottis Johnson, AFGE District 14 vice president and a veteran himself. 
“As VA and employees are facing layoffs, our veterans earned their benefits, and they deserve better than threats to their care. But it is not just veterans who are at risk because of these attacks on federal jobs. Virginia’s economy depends on federal jobs. People are going to feel this in every corner of the commonwealth.”
Less than a week after the leaked remarks were recorded, Earle-Sears appeared alongside Youngkin at a March 19 event in Richmond where both officials defended the job cuts as part of a larger plan for national economic health.
“Today, we know we have a federal government that is facing huge fiscal issues with $37 trillion in debt, with $2 trillion being added every year,” Youngkin said. “What that requires is real action quickly.”
Earle-Sears echoed the message, calling Virginia “resilient” and citing CNBC’s ranking of the commonwealth as the top state for business in 2024. Both touted the state’s Virginia Has Jobs platform, which they say lists over 250,000 available positions for displaced workers.
But union leaders say those promises don’t match reality.
“These workers can’t just walk into another job next week,” said Surette. “Many are specialized professionals. Some are still waiting on severance. And in the meantime, veterans are waiting on appointments, prescriptions, and essential services.”
Surette added that the disruption goes far beyond temporary economic turbulence, but that it strikes at the heart of the values many federal employees hold. 
“These are people who dedicated their lives to serving others … many of them twice, first in uniform and then in federal agencies. They deserve more than lip service. They deserve respect, support, and stability.”

(Patrick Myers, National Park Service/1.0)Having lived in Colorado for over 45 years, I have had the privilege of enjoying our public lands on the Eastern Plains, mountains, and Western Slope. I love our outdoors for its multitudes of recreational opportunities that Coloradans have enjoyed.
In 2023, Bureau of Land Management lands in Colorado contributed $8.8 billion to our economy and provided 39,000 jobs. Our public lands provide clean water and they filter pollutants, as well as provide crucial habitat that allow us to see pronghorn, bald eagles, and native wildlife in their natural habitat. Public lands generate substantial revenue through recreation and tourism while also providing invaluable ecological and quality-of-life benefits.
But these wild places are at more risk than ever. The new administration is taking action to undermine their protection. It has begun the process to disassemble the balance of how outdoor spaces are used and managed — inviting in more industrial activity at the expense of outdoor recreation, wildlife, and the preservation of cultural sites.
Bedrock environmental and cultural resource protection laws such as the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Act, and the 1906 Antiquities Act are being evaluated for dismantlement. As a result, our public lands could be further disrupted for short-term, private economic gain. Sell-offs of public lands for private gain would not benefit the general public. Rather, we would lose things that we would not get back. Coloradans recognize our public lands’ importance. According to a 2025 Colorado College State of the Rockies poll, over two-thirds of Coloradans oppose public land sell-offs.

Public lands are a source of health, prosperity and pride — they should not be profit playgrounds for industrial development. That is why I was glad for the recent passage of Colorado Senate Joint Resolution 25-9, a bipartisan affirmation of Colorado’s commitment to the protection of its public lands that highlights their economic, recreational, cultural and environmental importance. I urge our Colorado congressional delegation to follow the lead our state Legislature has taken on this issue by opposing efforts to sell, transfer or privatize these lands.
U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd’s district in southwest Colorado includes many acres of our public lands, like Mesa Verde National Park, a site especially significant to Colorado’s cultural heritage, and the Great Sand Dunes National Park, a geographical wonder and certified International Dark Sky Park where people can first-hand witness the splendor of nighttime views.
But it is not only our world class national parks, but also our national conservation areas — such as Dominguez-Escalante, Gunnison Gorge, and McInnis Canyons, as well as the numerous national forests and public rangelands — while lesser known, also hold tremendous historic significance, geologic diversity and wilderness quality. I personally have hiked in all of these special places with my family and friends, and have enjoyed the solitude and open space these special places offer to all Coloradans, and the visitors we attract from across the country.
 As Colorado continues to grow, and endures more pressure on our federally owned lands, maintaining these precious spaces, and preventing access restrictions, or transfer of ownership to private and industrial entities, becomes increasingly important to us longtime Coloradans, and newcomers, who have already experienced residential and commercial development, up to or close to the borders of these lands. We have directly seen what historic mineral exploitation and the associated contamination from these activities has done to scar many of these once  natural spaces.
These damages bring high remediation and ecological costs, which require money we can increasingly not afford due to the fiscal restraints we are experiencing both on the state and federal level. We must value what beautiful land we have left and learn from this past, damaging exploitation.
Lastly, we know that preventing the further degradation and loss of these natural spaces is important to mitigate the impact of climate change as these lands are important ecosystems for surface and groundwater storage that help minimize the flooding disasters and drought that are becoming increasingly common.
Political parties do not make a difference — we who enjoy the outdoors want our open spaces managed sensibly for our future generations, and the future of our planet.

Helen Haskell’s 15-year-old son, Lewis, died after surgery in 2000 because weekend hospital staffers didn’t realize he was in shock. The episodes turned both women into advocates for patients and spurred research that made American health care safer.
On April 1, the Trump administration slashed the organization that supported that research — the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ — and fired roughly half of its remaining employees as part of a perplexing reorganization of the federal Health and Human Services Department.
Haskell, of Columbia, South Carolina, has done research and helped write AHRQ-published surveys and guidebooks on patient engagement for hospitals. The dissolution of AHRQ is dislodging scores of experienced patient-safety experts, a brain drain that will be impossible to rectify, she said.
Survey data gathered by AHRQ provides much of what is known about hospitalizations for motor accidents, measles, methamphetamine, and thousands of other medical issues.
“Nobody does these things except AHRQ,” she said. “They’re all we’ve got. And now the barn door’s closed.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted on the social platform X on April 1 that layoffs at HHS, aimed at reducing the department’s workforce by about 20,000 employees, were the result of alleged inefficacy. “What we’ve been doing isn’t working,” he said. “Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year.”
But neither Kennedy nor President Donald Trump have explained why individual agencies such as AHRQ were targeted for cuts or indicated whether any of their work would continue.
At their first meeting with the leadership of AHRQ last month, officials from Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency said that they didn’t know what the agency did — and that its budget would be cut by 80% to 90%, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who were granted anonymity because of fears of retribution.
On March 28, the administration said AHRQ would merge with HHS’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
An AHRQ spokesperson, Rachel Seeger, said its acting chief, Mamatha Pancholi, was unavailable to answer questions.
Created on the foundation of an earlier agency in 1999, AHRQ has had two major functions: collecting survey data on U.S. health care expenditures, experiences, and outcomes; and funding research aimed at improving the safety and delivery of health care. It also has published tools and guidelines to enhance patient safety.
Its latest budget of $513 million amounts to about 0.04% of HHS spending.










There are all kinds of terrible things about our health care system’s outcomes and how we pay for it, the most expensive care in the world. “Without AHRQ, we’d be doing even worse.


– Richard Kronick, University of California-San Diego researcher and former AHRQ head


Newly sworn-in FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, a surgeon who has advocated for patient safety, wrote or co-authored at least 10 research papers supported by AHRQ funding since 1998. AHRQ research and guidelines played a key role in lowering the incidence of hospital-acquired infections — such as deadly blood infections caused by contaminated IV lines, which fell 28% from 2015 to 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Medical residents training in the 1980s were taught that such infections were an inevitable, often fatal byproduct of heart surgery, but AHRQ-funded research “showed that fairly simple checklists about preventing infections would be effective at going to zero,” said Richard Kronick, a University of California-San Diego researcher who led AHRQ from 2013 to 2016.
Medical errors caused by missed diagnoses, drug errors, hospital infections, and other factors kill and maim tens of thousands of Americans each year. Makary published a controversial study in 2016 hypothesizing that errors killed 250,000 people a year in the U.S. — making medical mistakes the nation’s third-leading cause of death.
“There are all kinds of terrible things about our health care system’s outcomes and how we pay for it, the most expensive care in the world,” Kronick said. “Without AHRQ, we’d be doing even worse.”
AHRQ-funded researchers such as Hardeep Singh at Baylor College of Medicine have chipped away at patient safety risks for more than two decades. Singh devises ways to integrate technologies like telemedicine and artificial intelligence into electronic health records to alert doctors to potential prescribing errors or misdiagnoses.
Singh has 15 scholars and support staff members supported by three AHRQ grants worth about $1.5 million, he said. The elimination of the agency’s office that funds outside researchers, among the cuts announced this week, is potentially “career-ending,” he said. “We need safety research to protect our patients from harms in health care. No organization in the world does more for that than AHRQ.”
Republicans have long been skeptical of AHRQ and the agency that preceded it. Some doctors saw it as meddling in their medical practices, while some GOP Congress members viewed it as duplicating the mission of the National Institutes of Health.
But when the Trump administration proposed merging it with NIH in 2018, a House-ordered study into health research priorities validated AHRQ’s valuable role.
Now, the naysayers have triumphed.
Gordon Schiff, a Harvard Medical School internist who has received AHRQ funding since 2001, was among the first to learn about policy changes there when in February he got an email from the editors of an AHRQ patient-safety website informing him “regretfully” that a 2022 case study on suicide prevention he co-authored had been removed “due to a perception that it violates the White House policy on websites ‘that inculcate or promote gender ideology.’”
The article was not about gender issues. It briefly mentioned that LGBTQ men were at a higher risk for suicide than the general population. Schiff was offered the option of removing the LGBTQ reference but refused. He and Harvard colleague Celeste Royce have sued AHRQ, HHS, and the Office of Personnel Management over removal of the article.
“All we were doing was presenting evidence-based risk factors from the literature,” he said. “To censor them would be a violation of scientific integrity and undermine the trustworthiness of these websites.”
PSNet, the AHRQ publication where Schiff and Royce’s article appeared, has been dissolved, although its website was still up as of April 2. Roughly half of AHRQ’s 300 staffers resigned following the initial DOGE warning; 111 staff members were fired April 1, according to an email that a top executive, Jeffrey Toven, sent to employees and was shown to KFF Health News. AHRQ’s remaining leadership was in the dark about Kennedy’s plans, he said.
HHS spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. Stephen Parente, a University of Minnesota finance professor who said he consults informally with Trump health officials, said much of AHRQ’s work could be done by others. Its most vital services have been surveys that Westat, a private research company, performs for AHRQ on contract, said Parente, who was chief economist for health policy in the first Trump administration.
At the height of the COVID pandemic, he said, data produced by AHRQ and other government sources were outclassed by private sources. To track COVID, he relied on daily feeds of private insurance data from around the country.
Still, Parente said, the virtual disappearance of AHRQ means “we’re going to lose a culture of research that is measured, thoughtful, and provides a channel for young investigators to make their marks.”
An AHRQ official said he was “generally skeptical” that AHRQ’s merger with the assistant secretary’s office would keep its mission alive. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the CDC conduct some health system quality research, but they are also losing staff, Harvard’s Schiff noted.
One of Schiff’s current AHRQ projects involved interviewing late-stage cancer patients to determine whether they could have been diagnosed earlier.
“The general public, I think, would like cancer to be diagnosed earlier, not when it’s stage 4 or stage 3,” he said. “There are things we could learn to improve our care and get more timely diagnosis of cancer.”
“Medical errors and patient safety risks aren’t going to go away on their own,” he said.
With input from Sheridan and other mothers of children who suffered from jaundice-related brain damage, AHRQ launched research that led to a change in the standard of care whereby all newborns in the U.S. are tested for jaundice before discharge from hospitals. Cases of jaundice-related brain damage declined from 7 per 100,000 to about 2 per 100,000 newborns from 1997 to 2012.
The misfortune of Lewis, Haskell’s son, led to a change in South Carolina law and later to a national requirement for hospitals to enable patients to demand emergency responses under certain circumstances.
Singh, a leading researcher on AI in health care, sees bitter irony in the way the Elon Musk-led DOGE has taken an ax to AHRQ, which recently put out a new request for proposals to study the technology. “Some think AI will fix health care without a human in the loop,” Singh said. “I doubt we get there by dismantling people who support or perform patient safety research. You need a human in the loop.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin tried to amend a bill that would require school boards to send annual notifications to parents about safe storage of prescription drugs and firearms, by adding a provision to prohibit schools from disclosing students’ gender identity questions to parents.
During the legislature’s one-day veto session on Wednesday, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said the governor’s tweak had nothing to do with the legislation, before lawmakers effectively rejected the change. The Senate initially opted to “pass by” the companion bill for the day, before rejecting it outright.
Lawmakers push back on Youngkin budget, pass bipartisan bills on probation, dangerous driving

The bill now heads back to Youngkin for consideration, but is at risk of being vetoed, since both branches failed to compromise.
Peter Finocchio, a spokesman for the governor, reiterated Youngkin’s support for parents.
“In Virginia, parents have a fundamental right to make decisions on their child’s upbringing, care, and education,” said Finocchio in a statement.
The legislation, carried by Del. Laura Jane Cohen, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax, would have tasked school boards in each district to send parents annual reminders about safely storing guns and prescription medications via email as well as text messages, if possible. The bill stipulated that school boards provide these reminders in more than one language and post them on the school district’s website.
Youngkin’s amendment would have required schools to notify at least one parent if a student seeks help from a social worker regarding their gender identity. Schools would also need parental permission before starting any plan to help students manage their gender feelings.
On Wednesday, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said the governor’s amendment has “absolutely nothing to do with the underlying bill” before asking Scott to determine if the governor’s amendment was germane.
“The governor’s recommendation strays from this original purpose by requiring notification to certain parents in limited instances, a much more specific and targeted notification not related to the subject of the original bill,” Scott concluded. “Therefore, the governor’s recommendation is not germane.”
Cohen agreed that the governor’s recommendation has no relevance to her proposal. She said this is an opportunity for him to show, as he says often, that he cares about kids. 
“I feel like the governor has the opportunity to, again, do the right thing,” Cohen said. “We’re sending it back to his desk, and he can choose to do the right thing and actually take some good preventive steps on making sure that we keep our kids safe from accidental poisonings and from accidental shootings.”
The language proposed by the governor is similar to a bill, carried by Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, which the House failed to take up during the regular session for a second straight year. Freitas’ bill, also known as Sage’s Law, was introduced by then-Republican Del. Dave LaRock during the 2023 General Assembly Session. It successfully passed in a Republican-controlled House, but died in the Senate controlled by Democrats. 
“While Sage’s Law did not even receive a hearing during the legislative session, parents have spoken loudly on this commonsense issue,” Youngkin spokesman Finocchio said.
Last year, lawmakers rejected the governor’s amendment for a similar proposal carried by Cohen and Pekarsky that would have required lawmakers to vote again on the notification bill for a second year. The amendment also prioritized parents by requiring the Virginia Department of Education to work with subject experts to create a list of parental rights and responsibilities and plan for distributing the list to parents.
“For the second year in a row, the governor has refused to address the substance of my bill,” Pekarsky said, naming gun and prescription drug safety and school-parent partnership as the goals of her measure.
“The governor refused to center the safety of children,” she said, “and instead took the opportunity to play politics with their safety.”

This week: More transparency in Richmond, a Prince William prosecutor must pay up for FOIA violations, and Virginia’s connection to the Epstein files. 
 After water crisis, Richmond launches FOIA reading room to bolster transparency

In a move aimed at restoring public trust and delivering on campaign promises, Richmond Mayor Danny Avula on Wednesday announced the launch of a new FOIA Reading Room, a public-facing online archive that will provide access to government records tied to the city’s January water crisis.
The effort comes less than three months after a major water emergency tested Avula’s leadership during his first days in office — and sparked dozens of records requests from residents, journalists and advocacy groups seeking answers.
“I said throughout my campaign and many times over the course of these first three months in office: Transparency is one of my core values,” Avula said in a statement. “The city’s FOIA team has worked incredibly hard over the last several months, and now I’m asking them to do a little bit more.”
The pilot FOIA Reading Room will serve as a central resource for documents of broad public interest that have already been released through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). According to the city, inclusion in the Reading Room is based on the judgment of subject matter experts, the city’s FOIA manager and other officials who determine which records are most likely to be requested again.
“Not every record released through a FOIA request will make its way into the Reading Room, but I hope residents and reporters alike will see this as a good-faith effort towards greater transparency,” Avula said. 
The new transparency measure also includes mandatory annual FOIA training for all city directors and deputy directors — a direct response to concerns over delays and inconsistencies in how departments handle records requests.
Since the January water crisis, Richmond has received 61 separate FOIA requests related to the incident — many of them containing multiple sub-requests — from 22 different individuals. 
About 55 staff members have been involved in fulfilling those requests, with the city taking the standard seven-day extension on 46 of them. Five were returned after the legal deadline, and the city has collected about $1,440 in total fees across all water-related requests.
Julia Holmes, the city’s FOIA manager, said the new reading room is designed to benefit both residents and city staff.
“We wanted to pilot a FOIA Reading Room to promote transparency and accountability, save Richmond residents time and money, and reduce the administrative burden to staff,” Holmes said. “My job, making sure the public has access to public records, is so important, and I’m excited for this new tool that will hopefully make it easier for folks to do that.”
The city said the FOIA Reading Room is still in its pilot phase but plans to expand it if the model proves successful.
Also on Wednesday, the city released the final after-action report from HNTB, the independent firm tasked with investigating the water crisis.
The assessment builds on preliminary and draft findings published in February and March, offering a deeper look into the root causes of the Jan. 6 outage and the city’s response. According to the final report, the crisis began with a complete loss of power at the city’s water treatment plant during a winter storm.
Two critical failures contributed to the prolonged outage: the facility was operating in “winter mode,” which relied on a single key component rather than the more resilient, redundant “summer mode.” At the same time, an automatic switch designed to transfer power to a backup source — known as a “bus tie” — failed to activate.
Together, these breakdowns resulted in an 80-minute loss of power that caused water to flood the plant’s basement, damaging essential electrical equipment and triggering a widespread service disruption.
The report also points to broader issues in the city’s emergency preparedness, including inadequate staffing and training, a lack of standardized operating procedures, and poor communication during the crisis. Several short- and long-term recommendations have already been implemented, officials said, with more concrete steps outlined in the final assessment to strengthen the city’s resilience against future disruptions.
 Prince William prosecutor ordered to pay $22K over FOIA violations

A Virginia judge has ordered Prince William County Commonwealth’s Attorney Amy Ashworth to pay $22,250 after her office violated the state’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) multiple times in response to a records request, InsideNoVa reported. 
The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed in 2023 by Valeria Juarez, a Fairfax County resident who requested 172 emails tied to the prosecution of Kevin Miles Lydon, a man convicted of multiple sexual assault charges between 2016 and 2018. Juarez claimed Ashworth’s office failed to produce the records in a timely manner and over-redacted them once released.
Chief Judge Angela Lemmon Horan of Prince William County Circuit Court found six FOIA violations in total, including a failure to provide records within the required 60-day period and insufficient explanations for withheld information.
“(Ashworth’s office) violated FOIA when they failed to ‘identify with reasonable particularity the subject matter of withheld portions,’” the court order states.
“There is no doubt that [the office] violated the FOIA statute numerous times and in numerous ways over more than a one-year period,” Horan added, pointing to delays and continued noncompliance over an 18-month span.
Ashworth’s office has filed a motion for reconsideration, asking the court to vacate the attorney’s fees award. In an email to InsideNoVa, Ashworth said her office “disagrees with the judge’s ruling.”
The motion argues Juarez did not “substantially prevail” in the case, citing a 2022 court ruling and claiming she received the requested documents before the lawsuit began. It also contends the fee award would be “unjust,” citing the volume of materials provided and delays allegedly caused by Juarez herself.
Judge Horan has paused enforcement of the ruling, pending a hearing on the motion, which has not yet been scheduled.

The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.

 Virginia FBI facility at center of Epstein document scramble

The FBI has mobilized hundreds of agents and FOIA analysts at its massive Central Records Complex in Winchester to process thousands of pages of Jeffrey Epstein records — a high-stakes scramble that’s delayed other public records work and intensified pressure on the bureau.
Epstein, previously a financier, died by suicide in prison while awaiting trial for alleged sex trafficking crimes. The internal shift comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that the FBI’s New York field office withheld Epstein files, Bloomberg News reported last week. 
In a Feb. 27 letter to FBI Director Kiran Patel, Bondi demanded the full release of the records, citing a tip from an unnamed source, according to the report. She also ordered an investigation and requested a report on potential “personnel action” within 14 days. The FBI has not said whether that report was completed and declined to comment.
Soon after, FBI employees received a directive — reportedly via text message — to begin working uninterrupted on the Epstein files. Many forwarded the messages to their official accounts to comply with federal recordkeeping laws.
Two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that special agents from Washington, D.C., and New York, as well as FOIA analysts and vetting staff, were pulled into the operation. Some employees reportedly logged more than 100 hours over two weeks and even slept on desks during a recent weekend session.
The FBI has already released thousands of Epstein-related documents, mostly from its Miami office, through its public FOIA reading room. But Bondi, during a White House event with far-right influencers like Jack Posobiec, handed out binders labeled “The Epstein Files,” suggesting major revelations — only to be mocked online when the files turned out to be previously released.
Meanwhile, conspiracy theories about Epstein’s connections and death continue to swirl, amplified by figures on the far right who accuse federal agencies of shielding the powerful. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tn., has pressed for more transparency, and FBI Director Patel has pledged to ensure the public “knows the full weight of what happened.”
But for now, as political pressure mounts, the bureau’s FOIA system remains bogged down, with its resources consumed by one of the country’s most infamous scandals.

North Carolina legislators continue not to “get it” when it comes to the state’s ever-worsening plague of gun violence. The latest disturbing example: a bill making its way through the state House that would allow private schools to arm teachers and, conceivably, even some students.
Bill sponsors say their intent is only to facilitate schools having armed security guards, but the bill is actually much broader than that.
As currently written, the legislation would allow anyone lawfully entitled to carry a concealed handgun to carry it on the premises of a private school, so long as they have the school’s permission.
Meanwhile, another bill advancing in Raleigh would allow anyone 18 or older to carry a concealed handgun without any kind of permit — an idea that polls show most North Carolinians think is a dreadful idea.
And together, in a state in which private school leaders have almost complete autonomy, the two measures are an invitation to tragedy.
The bottom line: One prays no school would ever head down this deadly road, but why lawmakers would even consider making it a possibility is impossible to fathom.

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)The main source of state funding for Ohio’s public libraries was eliminated in the House draft of the state operating budget for the next two years.
Library advocates say the changes are not in the best interest of Ohioans and could cut services from an area that is still reeling from $27 million in cuts to state funding last year.
The cuts from 2024 put them at the same funding level as they received 25 years ago, despite vastly different technology needs, social service roles, and demand for services.
The Ohio House’s budget draft rejects Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive proposal that would have increased the Public Library Fund from 1.7% to 1.75% of the tax revenue collected in the state’s General Revenue Fund.
Instead, the House version of the budget “establishes a new method of funding public libraries through a direct GRF appropriation,” according to documents.
Distribution of funds would move from the Ohio Department of Taxation to the Ohio Office of Budget and Management, where a new funding formula would send the funding to counties “in proportion to each county’s population,” the budget draft states.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
An analysis of the changes in the House proposal by the Ohio Library Council shows state funding would drop by more than $100 million over the biennium compared to what DeWine proposed.
Under the House version, public libraries in 39 counties would see funding cuts via the new distribution formula as soon as the budget is enacted, which is set to happen on July 1.
“Ohio’s public libraries have had a partnership with the state to deliver services at the local level for almost 100 years and that funding is now at risk,” said Michelle Francis, executive director of the Ohio Library Council, in a statement on the House proposal. “Public libraries serve all ages, and funding cuts of this magnitude could jeopardize the vital services that our communities rely on.”
Libraries have not only been sources of reading materials and literacy programs, but over the years have evolved into resources tailored to their areas, with food assistance programs, tax preparation, job training, and employment help. The materials that libraries house have changed as well, with physical materials joined by digital products and broadband access.
A gradual reduction in the Public Library Fund over the decades has created struggles for public libraries, and the need to tap residents for help in the form of property tax levies.
Ohio public libraries, State Library of Ohio, brace for funding uncertainty, hope for budget relief

‘This is censorship’
While potentially cutting public library funding even more, the House version of the budget also asks them to create a new system of shielding certain materials provided by the libraries.
The new budget proposal inserted a provision not included in DeWine’s executive budget, one that would require public libraries to place “material related to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression” in a part of the library that “is not primarily open to the view of minors.”
LGBTQ+ advocacy organization Equality Ohio released a statement strongly opposing the budget proposal as a whole, calling it “the most reckless bill to come out of the Ohio legislature,” including the provision on public library materials.
“Let’s be clear: No public funds should be weaponized to dismantle our rights or erase our existence,” said Dwayne Steward, executive director of Equality Ohio in a statement. “This is censorship. This is harm. And we must resist – together, for a future where every young person can see themselves and their families reflected in their libraries, their schools and their communities.”
Libraries are now also fighting battles on the federal level, where the Institute for Museum and Library Services was threatened with major cuts, and where staff at the agency have been placed on administrative leave as the Trump administration attempts funding cuts all over the federal government.
This funding impacts the State Library of Ohio, which conserves documents connected to the founding and development of Ohio, and works with public libraries in the state on resource-sharing agreements.
An email sent to the State Library of Ohio from the institute on March 31 notified the agency about the administrative leave, also noting that the employees would not be able to respond to emails or provide any information about “future timelines related to this action.”
The Ohio Senate has yet to produce its draft, with which the House draft will need to be merged before a final draft is sent to DeWine for his signature.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
In Rhode Island, roughly 329,000 people are enrolled in Medicaid, and 74% of those are working, according to 2024 data from KFF Health News.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility. In Rhode Island, about 100,000 people are enrolled because of the expansion, KFF data shows.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The House Finance Committee made its final recommendations for the state budget Thursday, sending a package to the full House that significantly cuts spending from Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s proposal, as lawmakers eye low revenues from New Hampshire business taxes.
House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, which have spent weeks in the House committee, will next go for a vote before the full House April 10, and then on to the state Senate. The final budget bills will not emerge until June.
But the House Finance Committee’s proposal reflected a sour outlook on tax revenue for next year — and a difference of opinion between lawmakers and the governor’s office. At the beginning of the process, House Finance Chairman Ken Weyler said that his committee would need to make nearly $800 million in cuts to Ayotte’s budget in order to get it in line with the revenue projections of the House Ways and Means Committee.
On Thursday, the committee passed a budget that achieves that balance, imposing a number of cutbacks to make it happen. Democrats slammed the proposal, and Republicans defended it, arguing that the circumstances required hard choices.
“This was a very difficult budget,” Weyler said. “The economy that has happened in the last few years has been terrible. (There has) been … mismanagement caused by the decisions in Washington, D.C., that have affected us all, and it has lowered the amount of revenue we expected. Obviously, that’s a reason that we have to cut the budget, because the revenue just isn’t there.” 
Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, a Concord Democrat and a former chairwoman of the committee, said, “This budget will have devastating and long-lasting effects on the neediest in our state, and for many more reasons, the minority will vote no.”
Here is a guide to some of what passed.

Slower revenue projections and bigger cuts
Off the bat, the House committee expects New Hampshire will start the next two-year budget period with a bigger revenue shortfall than Ayotte does; while Ayotte’s budget anticipates the state being $81 million behind expectations, the House projects a $149 million hole. That requires the House budget to draw $149 million out of the state’s Rainy Day Fund. (The fund currently has $293 million.) 
To make up for that gap, the House proposes spending less year to year than Ayotte’s budget. It would spend $3.7 billion from the general fund as opposed to Ayotte’s $3.9 billion. And the House budget would shrink the amount spent by the Education Trust Fund; Ayotte has proposed $1.3 billion per year and the House has proposed spending an average of $937 million per year. Under the House proposal some of that education spending would continue in the General Fund. 
To achieve those reductions, the House has recommended a series of cuts. 
Cutting state positions
Much of the reduced spending in the House proposal comes from eliminating positions at New Hampshire departments and agencies. But Weyler stressed that most of those positions are currently vacant.
“We were fortunate, as we looked at the budget, that there were as much as 16% vacancy rates across the board in almost all the agencies,” he said. “Some of those were funded, some were not, but the fact that they’ve been functioning for a year or more at that level of vacancies allowed us to take away those positions.”
The House budget would cut five positions in the Secretary of State’s Office; three in the Insurance Department; 34 in the Liquor Commission; 190 from the Department of Corrections; 14 from the Department of Business and Economic Affairs; eight from the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources; 27 from the Department of Education; and eight from the Department of Safety.
The budget would also institute “back of the budget” cuts to a number of departments — broad reductions that are not targeted to a position or program, but which the agencies must incorporate into their own spending by cutting programs and terminating positions internally.
That includes cuts of $7.9 million to the judicial branch, $600,000 to the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, $6 million to the Department of Environmental Services, $1 million to the legislative branch, $100,000 to the governor’s office, about $8.7 million to the New Hampshire Retirement System, $14.7 million to the Department of Justice, $10 million to the Department of Information Technology, and $46 million to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Eliminating agencies and commissions
In addition to paring down state agencies, the House budget would eliminate a number of smaller agencies in the state, a move that Republicans say is difficult but necessary, but that Democrats have denounced.
Most prominently, the committee has recommended getting rid of the Office of the Child Advocate, the watchdog agency created under the governorship of Chris Sununu that monitors the Division for Children, Youth, and Families after a series of child fatalities a decade ago.
The committee also recommended axing the State Council on the Arts, which provides grants to local arts programs. It also called for the repeal of the Human Rights Commission, an independent agency that hears civil rights and discrimination complaints and can make recommendations for prosecution to the Attorney General’s Office.
It would ax the state’s right-to-know ombudsman, who adjudicates disputes over public records laws to avoid parties needing to go to court, and the Housing Appeals Board, the newly created panel to speed up planning and zoning board disputes between towns and developers.
And it would cut the Office of Early Childhood Education within the state’s Department of Education. 
Cuts to university system
The House budget would reduce state spending on the University System of New Hampshire by $50 million over the two-year budget.  It would also eliminate the Governor’s Scholarship Fund, cutting $5.4 million over two years. 
The community college system would receive a $4 million cut in funding. 
Limits on funding to cities and towns, Medicaid providers, reproductive health
Among the programs cut by the House Finance Committee is the state’s family planning program, which provides funding to health centers for testing for cancers, sexually transmitted infections, and other health care. The committee has proposed cutting the $839,000 per year appropriated in Ayotte’s budget. 
The budget would also reduce spending in the state’s Medicaid program by $52.5 million in two years, a 3% reduction to providers. HB 2 would prohibit Medicaid from paying for circumcisions, a long-sought goal for Republicans. 
And the budget would also level fund the amount it distributes from the meals and rooms tax to cities and towns to $137 million a year, rather than a percentage amount, which amounts to an $11.2 million cut. 
A bigger expansion of education freedom accounts
While Ayotte had a more conservative approach to expanding universal education freedom accounts — removing income limits only for students who are already in public schools, starting in 2026 — the House has a more expansive approach. The House’s version would expand the income eligibility from 350% of the federal poverty level to 400% in the next school year, and then would make them universal in the 2026-2027 school year. 
The House budget also includes “open enrollment” legislation to allow residents of New Hampshire to attend any public school in the state that has capacity, even if they do not live in that school district. And it included legislation that would cap the amount that local school boards could increase their budgets and require a three-fifths majority vote by school district residents to override that cap. 
Meanwhile, the committee is keeping Ayotte’s mandatory cell phone ban in New Hampshire schools, but it is removing the governor’s grant program intended to help schools implement that policy. The House’s version of the committee also expands on the exemptions: Rather than just applying to students with disabilities, the exemptions also apply to students with medical needs such as insulin pumps and glucose sensors.
Repeal of motor vehicle inspections
Included in the budget is legislation to repeal New Hampshire’s annual requirement for motor vehicle inspections, which also passed the House as a standalone bill, House Bill 649. 
That also allowed House budget writers to eliminate eight positions in the Department of Safety related to the motor vehicle inspection program. 
Curtailing the Education Trust Fund
The House is proposing to curtail the size of the state’s Education Trust Fund, which pays for the state’s share of public schools and other programs such as the education freedom accounts, and is currently running a surplus. 
Ayotte’s budget also recommended that the percentage of revenues that go to the ETF be lowered, but the House recommends that those percentages be lowered further. For instance, 41% of the business profits tax goes to the trust fund currently; Ayotte would lower that to 34% and the House would lower that to 30%.
The real estate transfer tax and the tobacco tax allocations would both also be lowered to 30%.
The House would limit the use of the Education Trust Fund and override some of Ayotte’s proposals. Ayotte’s budget proposed using the fund to help pay for the community college dual and concurrent enrollment program, her cell phone grant program, and operating costs for the Department of Education. 
The House budget would also stop the Education Trust Fund from paying for student data collection and reporting, as well as building aid. Building aid and special education aid would be paid for via general funds.
 An overall increase in state fees

The new budget seeks to expand revenue by increasing a number of fees paid to the state by businesses and individuals. It would double the application fees for terrain alteration applications to the state. It would increase the price of elevator inspection fees, registration fees for dams, dredging and filling fees for wetlands, sewage fees, fees for agricultural products and equipment, fisheries habitat fees, driver’s license card fees, motor vehicle title fees, trucking fees, and vanity plate fees. 
The House budget would also defund the housing champion designation and grant program, which passed in 2023 and is designed to incentivize towns to improve their housing, and it would repeal the state Commission on Aging. 
The budget would create a new license plate: “Love NH Lakes,” which would join the state’s moose plate and provide a way for drivers to support cyanobacteria mitigation efforts for $30 a year. 
Preserving the Group II retirement reimbursements
Perhaps the one area of bipartisan agreement in the budget is the changes to retirement benefits for some state retirees.
In 2011, the Legislature reduced the retirement benefits for a number of “Group II” employees — which include police officers and firefighters — in order to address a shortfall in the state’s retirement system. Those employees have long argued that the state owes them the benefits promised to them; Ayotte’s budget would provide that reimbursement. The House budget preserves that adjustment. 
“As in any budget, there is going to be provisions the minority supports, particularly with respect to the Group II retirement,” said Wallner on Thursday. “But House Bill 2 goes on to take some radical actions.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4033243-House-Finance-1-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-04 05:58:48.233334

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.











A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture



“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)The Ohio General Assembly is considering a bill that would provide free breakfasts and lunches to children attending public schools. A strong majority of a panel of economists agreed that the measure would improve student outcomes, a survey released this week said.
Ohio Senate Bill 109, introduced by state Sens. Louis Blessing III, R-Colerain Township, and Kent Smith, D-Euclid, would provide the meals free of charge to all kids in Ohio’s public and charter schools at an estimated cost of $300 million a year.
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, claims that Ohio can’t afford public education at its current funding level. That level was derived in an attempt to resolve a 28-year-old state Supreme Court ruling that school funding was so paltry that it violated the Ohio Constitution. 
Ohio students plead with lawmakers for free breakfast and lunch in schools

This week, Huffman introduced a budget decimating the amount called for under the Fair School Funding Plan by about two-thirds, to $226 million.
Huffman claims that Ohio can’t afford to fund public schools a year after he supported giving nearly $1 billion a year in vouchers to families with kids in private school. The measure was sold as a way of helping low-income families afford private education, but nearly 90% of families receiving money are not low income and nearly 20% are in the state’s top income bracket.
Ohio subsidizes the wealthy in other ways, including the $1 billion it forgoes each year on an LLC tax break that has failed to produce the promised jobs. The subsidies also include more than $1 billion over a decade that used to flow into the state treasury from the liquor franchise. It’s now handed out as business incentives through JobsOhio — though the private agency hasn’t proven that it’s attracted any jobs.
Huffman says Ohio doesn’t have $666 million to fund public education, but his budget has $600 million to subsidize the billionaire Haslam family in building a new stadium for the perennially underperforming Cleveland Browns. The Haslams have claimed that the project would generate far more in tax revenue than the cost to taxpayers. But an expert told The Statehouse News Bureau that their assumptions were far too optimistic. And Cuyahoga County Executive Chris Ronayne has said the Haslams’ own model assumes that ticket prices would climb to $800 over the 30-year life of the bonds.
Ohio hasn’t had the best record when it comes to such deals. Cleveland.com last week reported that the state has little power to claw back $600 million it’s put up for an Intel plant that is now not expected to open until 2030 at the earliest, and is said to be unlikely to live up to its original promises.
Meanwhile, good public education seems to be at least as important to growing the Ohio economy as tax breaks and other subsidies for the wealthy. But spending $300 million a year on meals for public schoolchildren hasn’t made it out of the Ohio Senate committee to which the bill was assigned.
Majority of Ohioans are in favor of universal free school meal program, according to poll

The great majority of economists surveyed this week seemed to think it should. Asked whether “universal free school lunches will improve student outcomes such as test scores and graduation rates,” 14 agreed and three were uncertain.
“There is an abundant body of literature that finds that universal free school lunches not only improve average test scores and overall academic performance…, but also reduce suspensions,” Will Georgic of Ohio Wesleyan University wrote in the comments section of the survey. “While not every student’s academic achievement will improve, the average effect for all students will be unambiguously positive.”
Bill LaFayette of Regionomics said such a program would benefit family budgets and promote good nutrition.
“Many children, especially in urban districts, live in economically challenged families, possibly without access to fresh decent food. Hungry children cannot learn,” he wrote. “This would also relieve the household of an additional expense.”
David Brasington of the University of Cincinnati said he was uncertain of the overall benefit because he didn’t know how many families would take advantage of the program.
“It will help children who otherwise wouldn’t get the food, but this is a sufficiently small number of students that it wouldn’t move the needle,” he wrote. “My children also don’t like the food school offers, so take-up might be low, too low to make the cost worthwhile.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The economists were also asked whether they believed universal breakfasts and lunches at school would “promote equitable outcomes in Ohio’s K-12 education system.” Fourteen agreed, two were uncertain and one disagreed.
Jonathan Andreas said the program would promote student equality by not singling out those from low-income families.
“Universal benefits are more equitable than means-tested benefits because they literally treat everyone the same,” he wrote. “They increase equitability of social status by eliminating the stigma of singling out the needy for special help.”
Even though the program wouldn’t force anyone to eat school meals, Michael Jones of the University of Cincinnati disagreed that it would promote equity.  He said it would discourage some kids from staying home and having breakfast with their families.
“Encouraging children to eat breakfast at school rather than at home shifts parental responsibilities to government programs. This sends the message that providing basic needs such as food is something families can opt out of rather than prioritize,” he wrote. “Parents who value family time together should not be put at a financial disadvantage simply because they do not use a free school breakfast. Families are strengthened when children see their parents taking care of them.”

But Ohio state Sen. Michele Reynolds, R-Canal Winchester, and state Rep. Melanie Miller, R-Ashland, believe a different approach, one which drives a wedge between social media companies like Meta and the Apple and Google app stores, might survive court challenges. Instead of requiring individual apps verify a user’s age, Reynolds and Miller want the app store to impose a minimum age.
“The process is simple,” Miller said. “When a parent gets their teen a smartphone, the parent can easily go into the app store and confirm, one, that they are the parent or guardian, and number two, they can confirm and verify the teenager’s age.”
The parent would verify their child’s age, she explained, with an ID or a credit card. Third party apps would receive information about a user’s age range, but no “sensitive personal information.”
“While the ‘what’ may be the same the ‘how’ is different,” Reynolds insisted.
“For too long, we’ve expected each individual app developer to create their own age verification system, leading to inconsistent protections and privacy risks,” she said.
Reynolds argued that verifying a user’s age further upstream “recognizes the central role app stores can play in empowering parents while ensuring teens have age-appropriate online experiences.”
Why would this work?
By putting the onus on app stores, Reynolds and Miller are attempting to avoid the First Amendment challenges that sunk the last proposal. A federal judge called Ohio’s initial attempt at age verification a “breathtakingly blunt instrument.”
He determined the legislation regulated the content of speech in violation of the First Amendment because it made complicated distinctions among apps. By requiring all users to verify their age and identity, the approach also infringed on the right to speak anonymously. Instead of helping parents make decisions about what their kids see, the judge added, the bill substituted governmental for parental authority.

Reynolds and Miller were at pains to distinguish their legislation.
Reynolds argued they “address constitutional concerns that have arisen with other online safety laws by applying consistently to all apps rather than just selecting a specific platform.”
“And by protecting users’ ability to speak anonymously online,” she added, “we created a framework that can withstand these legal challenges.”
Miller said, “This legislation will put parents, not the government, in charge of their children’s online access.”
It’s not clear that focusing on app stores will be enough to overcome First Amendment concerns. But it might shake up the list of supporters and opponents.
Although Ohio’s first age verification system targeted social media, it got pushback from a much broader range of internet companies because its definitions were written so broadly.
The internet trade group NetChoice led the charge against Ohio’s law, which was put on hold in February last year. The organization secured similar rulings in three other states including a permanent injunction in Arkansas just this week.
Social media companies applaud Utah’s latest bill aimed at teen social media use

But a potential rift opened up following Utah’s approval of an app-store age-verification bill earlier this year.
Meta, which owns Faceboook, Instagram and Threads, joined Snapchat and X in a statement praising the bill. Google, on the other hand, argued the legislation was “pushed by Meta and other companies in an effort to offload their own responsibilities to keep kids safe.” In a white paper, Apple said checking the ages of app store users puts too much private data online.
Google, Meta and X are all members of NetChoice. The trade group testified against Utah’s proposal, but a split among its members might make it less likely to go to court. Apple and Google, which operate the two largest app stores, can afford to hire their own attorneys, but they won’t be presenting the same united front as previous court challenges.
In addition to Utah, and now Ohio, several other states have introduced legislation that attempts to verify age at the app store level. The group Digital Childhood Alliance, which organized to lobby in favor of app store legislation, cites seven states, not including Ohio. Other publications put the number as high as 16.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple successfully blocked one of app store bill in Louisiana last year.

The new political climate makes it even less likely that they speak up. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)Separated by six states and a time zone, students at two universities got opposite lessons about free speech last week.
In Somerville, Massachusetts, immigration officials detained a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University. It’s not certain why she was taken into custody, in full view of security cameras. However, in her university’s student newspaper last year she co-signed an op-ed that condemned her university’s investments because of links to Israel, among other critiques.
When contacted by multiple publications, the federal government fueled the suspicion that the editorial led to her detainment by refusing comment. Her friends wondered what other reason could there be, especially knowing that a pro-Israel website had spilled her private information onto the internet — an obvious intimidation effort before she was arrested by masked, plainclothes officials in unmarked cars.
The implicit message from the government: The First Amendment offers flimsy protection for international college students right now.
On that same day — more than 1,400 miles away in my lecture hall at the University of Kansas — I asked my students to take a First Amendment risk. Actually, asked isn’t a strong enough word. I needled and begged students to propose something risky. I coached them on how to recognize something truly risky. I celebrated the best risky ideas with applause and fist bumps.
In that introductory journalism class, we were proposing newsworthy journalistic story ideas. After years of teaching this skill, I know that if today’s students aren’t prodded, they overwhelmingly suggest predictable and safe story ideas.
They say, There is a new coffee shop near campus.
Or, The football stadium is under construction.
Each story has been covered before. Why would the students propose them? These topics are risk-free. Easy. Simple. Blandness is their allure.
Students routinely stash away the realities of college life — and they need encouragement to voice them.
One student raised her hand and said, What about my roommate who got a zero on a paper for using AI, even though she didn’t? Another says, What about a story about college cocaine use? From the left side of the lecture hall: I know some people who sell their driver’s licenses on Instagram for other college kids to use as fake IDs.
At that moment, they discovered the thrill of risky ideas. They laughed nervously at the off-limits ideas as they flowed from one group, then another.
Over a few class periods, we spent more than 120 minutes developing these stories, providing feedback and cajoling courage. This is the coaching that today’s university students need.
Long revered as places that liberate young people’s thinking, colleges have become more and more intellectually safe.
You don’t need to trust my personal anecdotes. After all, I am comparing memories of my undergraduate campus during the 1990s to my teaching years during the 2010s and 2020s. Just because I remember daily verbal sparring in the speaker’s circle at the University of Missouri doesn’t mean it’s true.
Instead, check out the results of the Knight Foundation’s annual study. The most recent poll relied on “a representative sample of 1,678 currently enrolled college students.”

“Discomfort with the speech environment on campus is rising, and 7 in 10 students say speech can be as damaging as physical violence.”
“Two in 3 students say self-censorship limits educationally valuable conversations on campus, and 2 in 3 report self-censoring on some topics during classroom discussions.”
“While 9 in 10 college students continue to feel that citizens’ free speech rights are very important to them, fewer students believe their freedom of speech is secure in 2024, down 30 percentage points from 2016.”

Who are the students who feel that it’s “becoming harder to express themselves”? Black students have had the lowest confidence of any segment each year, and they find free speech increasingly difficult. For their part, Republicans respond that it is more difficult for them than Democrats, but that gap has narrowed. Every segment of the college population sees free speech rights declining or, at best, holding steady.
If you need more, read this year’s report from the Foundation of Individual Rights and Expressions. While it doesn’t provide a nationwide portrait of free speech on U.S. campuses, it ranks the schools. Kansas State ranked 18 while KU ranked 203 of 251 universities. The study’s five-year run and increased scope this year point to the national interest in student speech at this political moment.
Back in my classroom, I called on a final student, asking what risky topic she imagined: the conflict in the Middle East.
Here, I paused.
Amid my lectures about being bold and taking intellectual risks, what should I tell international students about taking a risk and writing about the Middle East? The Trump administration has zip-tied a blinking, neon asterisk onto the topic.
It says, *Speak out and find out.
The Tufts student, Rumeysa Ozturk, is not alone in suffering consequences for pro-Palestinian activism and speech. According to the New York Times, another international student from Iran has been detained under unclear legal pretenses while a permanent resident of the United States was removed from Columbia University’s student housing after being involved in demonstrations against Israel.
Free speech about this narrow topic might cost students their personal freedom.
Reasonable minds may disagree about the conclusions in the commentary that Ozturk wrote. You might believe that universities should divest, that they should stand by Israel or that they should not make political statements at all. Regardless, it’s difficult to find radical language in the legislative actions that Ozturk and her fellow authors proposed.
The arrest of Ozturk redefines risk in university classrooms from the East Coast to the heartland, which seems to be the Trump administration’s objective. Why not inject free speech anxiety into campuses already hobbled by funding cuts and right-wing suspicion?
Chilling anti-Israel speech on college campuses further muzzles our already timid students. In the past decade, they’ve been cowed by a toxic cultural cocktail. Political polarization made them nervous both on social media and their high school classrooms. The murder of George Floyd supercharged discussions about racial injustice.
Pandemic-era lockdowns sheltered students from tough in-person debates. Even high school hallway fights disappeared during the lockdown. Many students can simply no longer argue.
Add to that, many students report being nervous that their authentic classroom curiosities will be recorded and posted online, leaving them “canceled.” A contentious classroom is high-stakes, unfamiliar terrain.
The ruthlessness of these arrests, therefore, is two-fold. First, university students sit in Louisiana detention centers awaiting hearings and possible detentions. That human reality bites hard.
Second, a few scattered arrests at distant universities might temper students’ courage — first about Israel, and perhaps about more to come. Will this news restrain my students in Kansas from saying what they think?
*Speak out and find out.
These arrests have changed my calculus as a teacher and mentor about how I would advise international students who want to express themselves.
Be careful, I would say. Even with summer approaching, it’s getting chilly on campus.
Let’s hope that my advice, like the weather, is temporary. But I suspect it’s the climate.

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.










There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.

Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
 ‘None of them are equitable’

In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”
Tribes, Native students sue feds over education cuts

Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
 Economic anchors

There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.
Why Alabama can’t control college tuition costs

Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”
US Education Department threatens yanking funds for schools that use race in decisions

For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

	Several candidates are vying to defeat a pair of incumbent Republican Georgia Public Service commissioners in an election that challengers say will become a referendum on rising Georgia Power bills.
Consumer watchdogs worry that the state’s largest utility will continue to raise rates on residential customers as it girds for a wave of data center growth that will spike demand for electricity over the next decade.
Qualifying for the Public Service Commission races wrapped up Thursday with Commissioner Tim Echols, who represents a wide swath of east Georgia, and Commissioner Fitz Johnson, who represents metro Atlanta, declaring their reelection bids.
Echols will face challenger Lee Muns in the June 17 Republican Primary for the commission’s District 2 seat.
The winner of the GOP primary will advance to a Nov. 4 general election against Savannah Democrat Alicia Johnson, who is unopposed in her primary.
This fall, Johnson will face the winner of the June 17 District 3 Democratic primary between DeKalb County clean energy advocate Peter Hubbard, former Atlanta state Rep. Keisha Sean Waites, technology advisor Robert Jones and Daniel Blackman, who will wage a second campaign after narrowly losing the 2020 election in a runoff to longtime Commissioner Lauren “Bubba” McDonald.
The PSC general election will be included on ballots for the Nov. 4 municipal election.
The statewide election is taking place on an irregular schedule for PSC races that typically result in staggered six-year terms in five commission districts. This year’s primary and general election will mark the first time since 2020 PSC contests will appear on Georgia ballots.
Echols’ 2022 election was delayed by a lawsuit challenging the commission’s at-large district election process as being unfair to Black voters.
Commissioners represent – and must reside in – one of the five districts but are elected statewide.
This years’ PSC candidates said they’ll work hard to drum up interest because turnout will be lower than when there are higher profile races for governor, Congress, and the White House on the ballot.
The challengers said they’ll be campaigning as the best candidate to fight on behalf of the public in Georgia Power cases that the current five member Republican commissioners have routinely given the green light to increase utility costs and fossil fuels.
Echols, who is running for his third term on the PSC, said he’ll campaign on his support of Georgia Power’s reinvestment in its power grid and natural gas system.

Echols said he’s been supportive of clean energy technologies like electric vehicles and solar energy and is proud of voting in favor of increasing affordability initiatives for Georgia Power seniors and low-income customers.
“We also want to continue to make Georgia the best place to do business because when these companies come they provide jobs and when companies compete like Hyundai and Gulfstream in Savannah, the consumer wins because they make more per hour,” he said.
Through his career in the construction industry, Muns says he learned how to build power plants in the most cost-effective way.
  Lee Muns (submitted photo)
Muns served five years on the Georgia Professional Standards Commission and is a former Columbia County school board member.
Muns said state regulators will have important decisions to make on the growth of mega data centers, the driving force in Georgia Power’s 2025 calls for significantly increasing its energy capacity over the next decade.
“In Georgia, we’ve got aging facilities,” Muns said. “We’re fortunate. We’ve got two nuclear power plant reactors that have come on board. But the thing that’s concerned me as I followed that process was the significant (Plant Vogtle) cost overruns.”
Alicia Johnson said her 25 years of policy advocacy in Savannah will help her pursuit of more clean, sustainable, and affordable energy in Georgia.
She criticized the commission’s approval of six Georgia Power rate hikes since the start of 2022.
“We believe that the underlying costs can be assumed by the companies themselves and not rolled over into the homes of everyday Georgia citizens who are now choosing between prescriptions and groceries, who are making choices between, paying their rent or their mortgage and getting gas,” Johnson said.

PSC’s Johnson faces four challengers
Fitz Johnson was appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021 to fill a vacancy on the commission and will stand for reelection for the first time.
Heading into his first bid to keep his seat on the regulatory panel, Fitz Johnson acknowledges the pushback from many Georgia Power customers about higher utility bills.
He said it’s important for the PSC to properly balance the needs of ratepayers while Georgia Power’s long-term Integrated Resource Plan case and the electric rate cases are decided this year.

“As part of our rule with the data centers… they are going to have to guarantee that contract so we don’t have the overbuild of infrastructure,” Johnson said. “Georgia Power, and I’m sure the power companies around the state, are doing a lot of pre-planning to make sure that we don’t overextend ourselves, to make sure that the fit is just right.”
Johnson attributed some of the rising utility costs to inflation and said he hopes to see rates stabilize under the Trump administration.
Blackman spent the last few years serving under President Joe Biden as a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency where he implemented $3.5 billion in federal funding for projects that includes electrifying school buses and for water infrastructure in DeKalb County.
  Daniel Blackman. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
He said he aims to add new transparency to the extent that data centers are boosting household utility rates, while advocating for low-income energy assistance programs and helping build a secure electric grid that makes up the network of infrastructure that powers homes and businesses.
“Our grid is extraordinarily important,” Blackman said. “Whether we’re protecting it from a national security risk or an extreme weather event, my goal is to campaign on a platform that ensures we can have a reliable grid without overburdening the ratepayers.”
Waites is an Atlanta Democrat who served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2012 to 2017. She resigned from the House in September 2017 to make a run for chair of the Fulton County Commission before finishing in second place. After being elected to the Atlanta City Council in 2021, Waites resigned in 2024 to launch a bid for Fulton County Superior Court clerk.
Hubbard, who works as a clean energy advocate for nonprofit Georgia Center for Energy Solutions, said he is running for the District 3 seat since the PSC “ignores” evidence he’s presented while intervening in Georgia Power Company’s Integrated Resource Plan cases since 2019.
Hubbard has pledged in campaign statement that he “will put an end to the grift and disinformation that are raising your power bills.”
“Residential power bills in Georgia have gone up $60 per month in just the last three years. This is because the current Public Service Commission approves each fossil fuel plan that Georgia Power Company gives it,” Hubbard said.
Robert Jones said he’s prepared to become the District 3 state regulator after gaining experience in energy and communications regulation in California.
  Public Service Commission candidate Robert Jones. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder
He criticizes the current commission’s decisions allowing Georgia Power to shift some construction cost risks to consumers and the company’s fight against the expansion of household rooftop solar power growth. Jones said as commissioner he would advocate for rooftop solar and reducing fossil fuel use.
“I think as an investor-owned profit making utility, they should assume more of the risk for their capital investments,” Jones said. “I think the commission erred by rejecting net metering on solar power. Rooftop solar power is where we need to be going in Georgia. It’s not a threat to Georgia Power.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)After 88 days in session, the Idaho Legislature moved closer to finishing its business for the year Thursday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
On Thursday night, the Idaho House of Representatives adjourned until 10 a.m. Friday, while the Idaho Senate adjourned until 9:30 a.m. Friday.
Legislators hoped to wrap up all of their work Thursday. But just before 7 p.m., Senate Majority Leader Lori Den Hartog, R-Meridian, said the Senate was short on staff and the paperwork and procedural work necessary to wrap up would have taxed the staff and kept everyone at the Statehouse way too late.
Moments later, House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, said the House hopes to finish its work Friday, but House members may need to work into the afternoon. 
“Hopefully we’ll be able to finish it all up tomorrow,” Monks said Thursday night. 
   Idaho legislators pass many unresolved state agency budgets 

To move closer to adjournment, legislators passed many of the unresolved agency budgets over the course of about 12 hours Thursday. 
The Idaho Senate kicked off the action Thursday morning by unanimously passing a key fiscal year 2026 natural resources maintenance of operations budget that the Senate had retained on its calendar for a month without taking action.
The natural resources budget, House Bill 248, was the last of 10 maintenance of operations budgets that needed to pass both chambers of the Idaho Legislature. The Idaho House of Representatives had already passed the natural resources budget back on Feb. 20.
By Thursday afternoon, the House picked up the budget-passing baton, passing key budgets for the Idaho Transportation Department, the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Idaho State Liquor Division — all three of which had previously failed. 
Thursday’s action by the Idaho Senate and Idaho House to pass many of the final budgets built upon the momentum JFAC generated a day earlier by rewriting the final failed budget enhancements and sending those rewritten budgets on to the Idaho House and Idaho Senate. 
  Budget committee co-chairwoman says fiscal year 2026 budget represents 6.7% increase over 2025 

During a break in the action Thursday, Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, provided a summary of the fiscal year 2026 budget. Horman said the full budget represents a 6.7% increase over the current budget, with 5% of the increase accounted for in the maintenance of operations budgets.
Horman said legislators are leaving a $400 million ending balance, in case of an economic downturn.
“We have work that we can all be proud of, because we have been able to fund essential governance services while returning as much money to the taxpayer as possible in setting a balanced budget,” Horman said. 
Thursday was the 88th day of the 2025 legislative session, which gaveled in back on Jan. 6.
There is no requirement to adjourn legislative sessions by any certain date.
Most legislative sessions run for about 80 to 90 days.

In a statement Thursday, Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai said the territory will end its satellite Internet contracts with Starlink, a Musk-owned company.
The Yukon has about 90 Starlink contracts, serving isolated road maintenance stations, hospitals, and other facilities.
Electric vehicles and chargers manufactured by Tesla — another Musk-owned company — will no longer be eligible for the Yukon’s Good Energy Program, which offers incentives to residents who buy electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.
The territory’s official communications will switch away from X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. That platform is also owned by Musk, who limits news content and uses it to spread pro-Trump positions.
“These measures build on our initial response, which included ending the sale of U.S. alcohol in government-run liquor stores and stopping any new wholesale orders for U.S. liquor,” Pillai said in a news conference.
Pillai said he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and other provincial leaders early Thursday, and that those leaders intended to take additional actions.
He noted that Alaskans share a close relationship with the Yukon and thanked Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for voting to end some tariffs that target Canada.
“We want Americans to keep coming here, keep spending money here, keep visiting your friends and family members in the Yukon and in Canada,” Pillai said. “Show your support for Canada by visiting Canada and by understanding why not as many of us may be in a hurry to come and visit you.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, returning to the Denver area Thursday after he was confirmed as a member of President Donald Trump’s cabinet, repeatedly minimized the consequences of climate change when speaking to reporters during a press conference. 
Wright, founder of Denver-based fracking services company Liberty Energy, spoke to employees at the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden for less than 10 minutes, touching on powering artificial intelligence, electricity production and growth, and supporting national labs. 
Talking to reporters after he spoke to staff, Wright said “emotional, not-fact-based stuff” like targeting hydrocarbons — the main components of climate change-causing fossil fuels — for reductions is “disruptive” and led to higher electricity and energy prices during the Biden administration.

Wright said that attributing the Marshall Fire — which in 2021 destroyed more than 1,000 homes in Boulder County, burned over 6,000 acres, caused more than $2 billion in property damage and killed two people — to climate change is “simply to not look at the data.” He said wildfires “peaked over 100 years ago” and that the U.S. government could better manage wildfire devastation through forest management to control wood fuels. 
“Calling climate change a crisis is just to say ‘I’m not going to look at the science, I’m not going to look at the economics, I’m just going to run with the politics,’” Wright said. 
Drier and hotter conditions in Colorado are widely viewed as having contributed to the severity of the Marshall Fire, making the potential for loss greater. Investigators said one of the fire’s origins was a spark from an Xcel Energy power line, and the utility company has since faced several lawsuits.
Wright has previously expressed deep skepticism of the scientific consensus that climate change is a global crisis.
Department layoffs
The Department of Energy, along with many other federal agencies, laid off probationary staff members, and a judge then ordered the department reinstate them. The Trump administration asked all department heads to plan for additional cuts through a “reduction in force” process. 
Wright did not say how many more employees within his department could expect to lose their jobs, but he said downsizing is an “ongoing process” and that “it would be downright irresponsible if we weren’t doing this.” He said department staff grew by 20% over the four years before he took over, and “what we got out of it was a little bit more restrictions in energy production around the country.” 
Energy Department leadership told workers this week it will undergo “restructuring.” Wright said each department will undergo “a very detailed organization, bottom up.” 
“Every part of the government, we have to look at, how can we make government services as good as they are today or better, but at lower cost,” Wright said. “Like I do with my business, we have to look carefully at the business of where we are today and how can we deliver services at least as good as we are today at lower cost.”
In Wright’s talk to staff at the NREL, he applauded the work and dedication of the employees he spoke with and said their work is “critical.”
“The range of stuff I saw today, different people that spoke on different technologies, incredibly impressive, passionate, smart people that you can see from their heart that believe in what they’re doing, that love what they’re doing,” Wright said.

After he was appointed, Wright said one of his first moves was to bring together leaders of the national labs from around the country to ask what they needed to make their work more efficient. Last week, he issued a secretarial order making changes he said resulted from those conversations. 
Artificial intelligence is “the next energy-intensive manufacturing industry,” Wright said in Golden, and the U.S. should not outsource that energy production to other countries. He said he issued a request for information Thursday to gauge developer interest in building on DOE land around the country to power AI.  
“We have land at all of our national labs and DOE sites around the country — who wants to come build a data center, build (a) nearby energy system, use the technology and smarts we got at the national lab … Maybe donate some computing power to us, or some lease money for the lands that’ll help fund our research,” Wright said. “We’re trying to find different ways to make the labs faster, smarter, better and more self-sufficient, more funding from other sources as well.” 
Wright said he would make “a commercial arrangement” with private data center companies that want to use federal land, because “that’s where the capital is.” 
NREL is responsible for researching and developing renewable energy systems and improving energy efficiency in the U.S. It has another campus in Arvada, as well as one in Alaska and in Washington, D.C., with 3,675 employees across the four locations.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — A $729,000 consultant contract will be added to the roughly $50 million South Dakota has already spent on a stalled prison construction effort. 
State officials signed a contract this week to pay a consultant to repeat and update a $323,000 prison facilities report that has framed three years of discussions on the state’s correctional needs.
The contract with Phoenix-based Arrington Watkins is just the latest deduction from a $62 million pool of money spent down to less than a fifth of its original size to prepare for a now-paused Lincoln County prison project.
On Thursday, representatives with the Gov. Larry Rhoden administration acknowledged that taxpayers will be out most of that money unless lawmakers vote to revive the controversial project — or a scaled-down version of it — during a June special legislative session.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

About $50 million of the money is already gone. It was spent to secure land, design a campus, and secure a stake in the electrical, water and sewer infrastructure that would’ve been necessary to house and care for 1,500 inmates. The state’s under contract to spend millions more, but has paused that work.
The state could “claw back” some of that $50 million, but Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the administration knew there could be “significant costs” to shifting course.
“We’re doing what we can to reduce that, but it could be a considerable amount, and that’s something we have to consider as we move forward,” Venhuzen said after a meeting of the Project Prison Reset work group at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance.
The state based its earlier decision to pursue an $825 million facility largely on the recommendations of a 2022 report from the Omaha-based DLR Group. Lawmakers rejected that idea in February.
That report outlined the state’s correctional system deficiencies and recommended a host of potential solutions. The lawmakers most skeptical of the Lincoln County prison proposal repeatedly cited that report’s lower men’s prison price estimate, as well as its smaller-scale alternative prison construction options. 
The forthcoming Arrington Watkins report will ask the same sorts of questions. Ryan Brunner, the Rhoden adviser who serves as his point person on prison issues, said Thursday that eight members of the work group reviewed the contract before the state signed it.
The state is also preparing to release a request for information, Brunner said, seeking interest from any landowners who might be willing to sell their property to the state for prison projects.
Work performed based on old report
After the meeting, Venhuizen said the work group would use the Arrington Watkins report and any interest gleaned from the land-seeking notice to decide where to go next on prison construction.
The DLR suggested a 1,300-bed men’s prison, but affixed a far smaller price tag than the one lawmakers were presented with last November. 
Under the direction of the Department of Corrections, a 2022 summer study group endorsed a 1,500-bed facility. 
Initial 2023 design contracts for that facility, partially redacted versions of which were given to South Dakota Searchlight by the DOC last month, put the top price at $450 million — roughly in line with DLR Group’s estimates. An amended contract soon pushed that figure higher. A contract amendment in April of 2024 put the “not to exceed” price at $740 million.

That figure was not offered during a legislative Appropriations Committee the following month, though. At that meeting, and another legislative meeting later that summer, lawmakers were told that the “guaranteed maximum price” would come in November. 
By the time that $825 million number arrived, the state had already spent millions to design the facility, drill test bores for a possible geothermal energy system, and to scan for cultural artifacts and wetlands.
The state continued to sign contracts for the Lincoln County prison project into early 2025. The $825 million guaranteed price expired in March.
Lawmakers who’d hoped to move forward with the project warned their compatriots that the price would only grow through inaction. 
Michelle Jensen, one of the Lincoln County landowners who sued the state over the prison plan, offered a different perspective in her public testimony to the work group on Thursday.
Jensen noted that a final decision from the state Supreme Court in that lawsuit could come after the June special session. 
The remedy for financial losses in Lincoln County, Jensen said, should have been for the state to “stop spending money out there if you know it’s a thing that might not happen.”
Jensen also suggested that the state could sell the land. 
The DOC transferred about $8 million to the Office of School and Public Lands to obtain the title to the 320 Lincoln County acres upon which it had hoped to build its prison. The land had passed into the ownership of the state Office of School and Public Lands years ago when the owners died without heirs or a will. 
On a roadside viewing of the property Wednesday afternoon, Brunner told the work group that the state only needed half the property for the prison, and that the other half was reserved for possible future use.
Federal funding could still benefit state, but only near Lennox
Brunner sounded a hopeful note Thursday on a $10.5 million contract with the city of Lennox for a sewer line. 
The line’s not in the ground yet, even though Lennox has collected the money.

Funding for all but $500,000 of that contract came from the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The ARPA dollars had to be obligated to a water or sewer infrastructure project by Dec. 31, 2024.
Had the prison project gone forward, Lennox would’ve been in line for $50,000 monthly payments from the state. Those monthly payments would amount to less than $30 per person for each of the people — inmates and staff — who’d have used the prison’s toilets, sinks and showers. 
“It’s not that much different than your household sewer bill,” Brunner reasoned on Thursday. “And so we don’t start paying that until we actually start running sewage.”
If the work group picks a site within 10 miles of Lennox in any direction for any other prison project, Brunner said, the state will still get something from that investment.
“If you’re within 10 miles of Lennox, it’s possible we could run that line to it,” Brunner said.
The state also entered into agreements with Southeastern Electric Cooperative and South Lincoln Rural Water to pay for portions of upgrades planned by the respective utility providers. The state has paid for some of its stake in those projects. Brunner said the state could still pull out of a substation project, since the station has yet to be placed and could move to another location.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Twenty people lined up Thursday at the Military Heritage Alliance to share their thoughts on South Dakota’s correctional needs with the group of lawmakers and other assorted officials tasked with finding ways to address prison overcrowding.
There was talk of offender re-entry, rehabilitation and second chances. The state penitentiary in Sioux Falls was called unsafe and inadequate, but also endorsed as a building with life left in it. There were calls for a work release center in Vermillion and a small, new men’s prison in Rapid City.
One prominent idea, however, drew no public support: the $825 million men’s prison the state Department of Corrections spent $50 million last year preparing to build before lawmakers shut it down. 
With $50 million spent already, state hires new consultant to restart prison planning

The public testimony came at the end of the first meeting for the Project Prison Reset work group. Gov. Larry Rhoden created the group in response to the legislative defeat of the 1,500-bed Lincoln County prison project, asking its members to determine what, if anything, should be built to ease the burden on the state’s correctional facilities.
During the first half of the all-day Thursday affair, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko repeated statistics she’s rattled off over the past three years. The state penitentiary in Sioux Falls has twice the inmates it’s designed for. Other facilities, such as the Rapid City minimum custody center, have as many as triple the inmates they ought to.
Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, a former college campus, is home to more than a thousand inmates. That population, Wasko told the work group, shouldn’t rise above the hundreds.
It’s the state penitentiary and its once-hoped-for Lincoln County replacement, however, that served as both the catalyst for the work group’s creation and the flurry of public commentary its members faced Thursday.
Safety, location concerns
A parolee who’d been ducking supervision shot a police officer on Tuesday afternoon in central Sioux Falls, Mayor Paul TenHaken noted in his testimony. He suggested the state prison system releases inmates it shouldn’t because “there’s no room at the inn.”

Without a new prison, TenHaken said, “I’m afraid we’re going to continue to see the kind of thing we saw this week.”
TenHaken has said in the past that he’d rather not have a prison in Sioux Falls city limits, but said Thursday he hadn’t come to the meeting to stake out a position on the site. 
Joel Arends did, though. Arends represents southern Sioux Falls on the Lincoln County Commission. He called the proposition of a prison on land that would otherwise become high-value homes “a buzzkill” for his county, one of the fastest-growing in the state. 
“The prison site is designed for rural housing, not commercial, industrial uses,” Arends said.
Another Lincoln County commissioner, Douglas Putnam, argued that the penitentiary has never been well-placed in Sioux Falls. It was built prior to statehood, and Putnam said the logic behind placing the Capitol in the middle of the state ought to apply as its leaders now ponder a replacement for the 1881 facility in South Dakota’s southeast corner.
“This needs to be in the middle of the state, to serve everybody,” Putnam said. 
Some call rehabilitation, second chances key to reform
Karen Schwebach, a 30-year prison volunteer, zeroed in on the potential of mercy to lessen the state’s correctional workload. There are numerous inmates with life sentences who have long since changed their ways, she said, and clemency actions for those with records of self-improvement ought to be part of any conversation on how to address the prison population.
“South Dakota can still be tough on crime, but we can strike a balance by giving another chance to the men that really have changed their lives,” Schwebach said. 
Bob Schatz, a former inmate who left the prison system in 2014, also focused on issues outside of building needs. He had several ideas for reducing the number of inmates who fail upon release and wind up back in the system.

Perhaps the simplest, Schatz suggested, would be to expand the state’s drug court program to include parolees. Currently, all the drug court participants who get 18 months of intensive supervision and support for sobriety are probationers, working their way through the program to avoid a prison sentence. 
Opening up such a program for parolees would help set more of them up for long-term success, he said.
“Six in 10 people complete that program,” Schatz said.
Pam Pakieser of Sioux Falls also spoke of her time in the state’s prison system, several decades ago at this point, and what’s helped her stay out. It wasn’t a parole officer or re-entry program, she said, but the kindness of volunteers and others willing to support her along the way.
Today, she tries to help others on the inside and their families. A loved one is currently imprisoned at the state penitentiary, she said, and fears for his safety in the face of repeated bouts of violence and the ensuing lockdowns.
A new building might be necessary, she said, but finding out the why behind the deteriorating security situation in the buildings the DOC should be just as serious a focus.
“We can put whatever we want on a pretty chart,” Pakieser said. “I would like people, mostly you people, to talk to the ones in the trenches to see what’s really going on.”
Sam Lint, a man serving a life sentence for first-degree murder, spoke into the microphone through the speaker of his mother’s phone.
Lint spent 14 years in the Jameson Annex of the Sioux Falls correctional campus unit before transferring to “the Hill,” the informal name for the 1881 penitentiary. The state “needs a new prison,” Lint said, but it also needs to find a way to better serve its inmates and protect correctional staff.
In the past three years, he said, life behind the walls has gotten more difficult, particularly for the majority of inmates who, unlike him, will be released into their communities eventually.
“What we have here are buildings full of classrooms that sit empty most of the time,” Lint said.

Defense lawyer, former warden: Consider more than one location
Ryan Kolbeck, a Sioux Falls defense lawyer, asked the work group to look beyond one Sioux Falls-area prison as a solution. 
His clients often struggle with addiction, Kolbeck said, and they have better chances in his city because there’s a better chance they’ll get a slot in treatment. 
He said the state ought to find ways to expand probation supervision and addiction treatment in rural areas so defendants there have as many chances to sidestep a prison sentence as those in Sioux Falls do. 
Ideally, Kolbeck said, a judge is able to deal with a defendant the way a parent deals with a child who spills milk: by giving them a chance to correct the problem. 
“When the kid cleans up the milk, there’s nothing for the parent to do,” Kolbeck said.

Kolbeck suggested smaller work release centers around the state, in addition to any higher-security facility. He pointed to Vermillion, where voters just approved a new jail and students at the University of South Dakota might partner with the Department of Corrections to help boost the number of inmates earning their high school diploma behind bars.
Earlier in the day, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko ran through slides showing how many of the 3,900 or so inmates in the state system had earned high school equivalency diplomas in the previous year.
Between male and female inmates, the number was 135. Just one was female, Wasko said, owing to the loss of an instructor for the program last year.
Kolbeck reacted strongly to those statistics.
“That’s embarrassing,” he said.
Darin Young was warden at the penitentiary until 2021. That year, he and a handful of other DOC employees were removed by the administration of then-Gov. Kristi Noem under allegations of nepotism and harassment that were never fully publicly explained and never resulted in criminal charges. Since then, four people have cycled through as Sioux Falls warden. Former Warden Teresa Bittinger resigned last fall, shortly after a weekslong lockdown that saw the complex’s sweat lodges dismantled in a search for contraband. 
The current warden, serving in an interim role, is Amber Pirraglia, who had been working as director of prisons until Bittinger’s departure.
On Thursday, Young told the prison reset group that the penitentiary could still safely house inmates if the state were to think beyond a single replacement for it. The DOC could build a floor onto the Jameson Annex, he suggested in a letter to the group. It could also put a new building on 28 acres of land it owns to the north of the penitentiary, build a smaller medium-security unit on state land near the Human Services Center in Yankton and take a handful of other steps to upgrade facilities across the system.
In his spoken testimony, Young reminded the group that lawmakers have set aside nearly $600 million for prisons in recent years. If the state’s going to spend that kind of money, Young said Thursday, “it has to be a home run.”

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Two Arkansas lawmakers expressed frustration Thursday that their efforts to allow food stamp recipients to save more of their income were delayed.
Arkansas is one of 13 states with an asset limit for SNAP recipients. Assets include cash on hand and in the bank, savings certificates and stocks and bonds, among other things.
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, attempted in 2023 to raise the asset limit from $2,250 to $6,000 for Arkansans to qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. He and Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, are cosponsoring a bill this year with the same provision, and House Bill 1915 would also require the asset limit to be adjusted for inflation every two years. 
HB 1915 did not receive a vote Thursday after members of the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee said they wanted clarity about how much the change would cost the state.
SNAP is entirely federally-funded with the exception of administrative costs, Department of Human Services Secretary Kristi Putnam said. Even so, Putnam said she opposed new changes to the SNAP asset limit while the state has not yet seen the impact of Act 675, the final version of Dismang’s 2023 bill.
Act 675 kept the $2,250 asset limit — which the federal government increased to $3,000 last year — but authorized a USDA waiver request to allow exemptions for individual families with more assets. Those families would have a new asset limit of $5,500 and remain enrolled in SNAP as long as they receive an exemption within a year of exceeding the current limit, and they would only be allowed one exemption every five years. HB 1915 would repeal this provision and replace it with the $6,000 asset limit.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 675 after it had been amended twice. The original version would have raised the SNAP asset limit to $12,500, but Sanders said she opposed “expanding welfare,” even after Dismang reduced the proposed limit to $6,000.

Advocates for child well-being call for removal of barriers to Arkansas SNAP participation


Earlier on Thursday, the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive Subcommittee approved an emergency rule to amend DHS’ SNAP Certification Manual with the requirements put forth in Act 675.
When asked why the policy took two years to enact, Putnam told the subcommittee that DHS “made it more complicated than it needed to be.”
Act 675 and the new emergency rule allow families who qualify for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to also qualify for SNAP. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families expressed support for this policy change in a January report that called for the state to remove barriers to SNAP qualification and enrollment.
DHS Division of County Operations Director Mary Franklin told lawmakers in January that enacting Act 675 did not require a USDA waiver as stated in the law, but the department needed to ensure it had the funding to enact the policy.
Dismang said at the time that he was “disappointed” that Act 675 had not been implemented at all in two years. He repeated this statement in an interview Thursday.
 Committee debate

Eubanks similarly expressed disappointment with the lack of action on HB 1915. He told the Public Health committee that he had been under the impression DHS was neutral on the bill.
“How long are we supposed to wait?” Eubanks said. “I believe we need to move forward on this.”
Republican Reps. Jeremy Wooldridge of Marmaduke and Cameron Cooper of Romance said they were sympathetic to the intent of HB 1915 but wanted to know the fiscal impact of the bill before voting on it.
Putnam said DHS will examine income trends and try to project how many people will remain on SNAP longer under a $6,000 asset limit.
She said DHS will have the fiscal impact report ready by Monday, and committee vice chair Wooldridge said members will vote on the bill Tuesday.

The bill would have to advance with no roadblocks or amendments in order to reach Sanders’ desk by the end of the legislative session on April 16, Dismang said.
He also said potential fiscal impact should not be an issue, not only because SNAP is federally funded but also because allowing SNAP recipients to collect more assets while enrolled in the program “should eliminate some of the turnover that may be occurring right now, so there may actually be a decrease in the demand that’s getting placed on DHS.”
“I sure wish they were as diligent running impact [statements] on this as they are with some other bills that have run through the session,” Dismang said.
If HB 1915 does not clear the Legislature by April 16, Dismang said he is willing to try again in 2027, but there might be some ways to address the asset limit “that do not require legislation” in the meantime.
In addition to Putnam, Opportunity Arkansas CEO Nicholas Horton spoke against HB 1915, saying it would keep low-income people reliant on government aid.
Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance Advocacy Director Lance Whitney disputed Horton’s statements while speaking in favor of HB 1915. He said most SNAP beneficiaries are only enrolled in the program for 18 to 22 months on average.
“We are currently looking at seniors, veterans and households who are looking for the ladder to get out of the hole… to get out of these safety net programs, but they need to have the rungs on the ladder to reach that,” Whitney said.

Ed Byrne said on Thursday.
The Bigfork legislator’s bill isn’t that way anymore and has become a property tax option for the Montana Legislature.
“It was beautiful, because nobody in the House knew it was coming, except the coalitions we built around it,” Byrne said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “So the support I had throughout the whole thing, building at this for two months to get the votes.”
HB 528 drops agricultural land to a property tax rate of 1.7% from 2.61%, while residential properties less than $1.5 million would be taxed at 0.76%, currently at 1.35%.
Residential property at more than $1.5 million would be taxed at 1.35% and commercial property in Class 4 would be taxed at 1.35%. Currently, residential property more than $1.5 million and commercial property in Class 4 are taxed at 1.89%.
Two major property tax bills — House Bill 231 and House Bill 154 — were tabled in the Senate Taxation Committee on Wednesday as debate continues on a fix for homeowners across the state.
HB 528 has bipartisan support, and Byrne, a Republican, worked with Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, on the legislation. It passed 12-11 out of the appropriations committee on Tuesday.
It previously passed the House on a 88-9 vote on March 21.
Byrne’s bill adjusts property tax rates on agricultural, residential and “Main Street” commercial properties, Dunwell said. It’s similar to SB 189, which was brought by Dunwell and tabled in the Senate Taxation Committee on April 1.
The hope was that either Byrne’s or Dunwell’s bill would gain traction in the Legislature.
“And at the end, if it’s not the vehicle, which it very well may not be, at least the meat of it would be in there, because our bills were simple, no complications,” Dunwell said.
Dunwell also said their bills could be implemented immediately, giving Montanans access to property tax relief sooner.
Byrne stressed the bipartisan nature of the legislation, noting how he watched then-speaker Sen. Matt Reiger, a Republican, work with Democrats, Rep. Mary Caferro and then minority leader Kim Abbott, last session, as they worked on problems they had with the Governor’s budget.
“When you can work bipartisan on the budget issues, you still don’t agree on the social, moral issues, you’ve got to put all that aside,” Byrne said. “It’s not personal, and you come in to fix what’s right on fiscal and taxes. And our biggest mandate here was taxes.”
  ‘It’s not over ‘til it’s over’ 

HB 231, brought by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, would have shifted some of the tax burden onto those who are not residents of the state, but own property in Montana. 
Jones called HB 528 the “preferred bill for implementing tax cuts” in an email to lobbyists on March 28. The bill also ran into trouble in Billings and Sunburst.
During the bill’s Senate hearing, Billings officials said HB 231 would shrink the tax base by about 12%. 
Sunburst and Billings have a unique charter, which has specific stipulations around how many mills they can levy without voter approval. Leaders there say they would have to go back to voters in their towns to raise taxes for critical services, like police and fire.
HB 231 was supported by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, and the legislation came to be known as the “Homestead bill.” Gianforte said he was disappointed in the tabling of the legislation, “the fairest approach,” during a Thursday press conference.
“It’s not over till it’s over, but we collectively, including myself and the legislature, we can’t leave here without implementing permanent property tax relief for the people of Montana,” Gianforte said.
HB 154, brought by Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, was a tax credit seeking to give direct help to renters and middle class property tax payers. HB 231 and HB 154 were both tabled.
“So, of course, it’s disappointing, but tabling a bill is not permanent,” Karlen said. “We take bills off the table all the time. We can blast bills in the Senate. So by no means I view it as the end of the line.”
Republicans have also brought a steady flow of rebate bills. Those aren’t the whole answer, Karlen said.
“My take on a rebate is that it’s like putting a band aid on a very deep wound that needs surgery,” Karlen said. “And so I think that any place for rebates should be to augment structural tax reform.”
Senate Bill 90, brought by Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, sought to use lodging and rental car tax revenues to provide relief, but was tabled in the House Taxation Committee on Thursday morning.
Other property tax bills have also been discussed. Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, has SB 117, which puts limits on what government property tax increases local municipalities can do and changes the inflation limitation for calculating property tax levies.
Both bills were cited by Senate President Matt Reiger as part of the solution for property tax relief. However, Reiger also said two bills from Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson — SB 204 and SB 205 — would have completed the needed fix. SB 204 failed on a third reading in the Senate and SB 205 was indefinitely postponed.

“It was always going to be difficult, because anything that we do in Montana is just shifting taxes from one taxpayer to another,” Hertz said to the Daily Montanan. “And that’s a very difficult thing for anybody to raise somebody else’s taxes.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-652093876-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 22:03:59.179055

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Editor’s note: A previous related article on the bill passing the Idaho Senate was mistakenly removed from the Idaho Capital Sun’s website Thursday afternoon. This article includes information from that article, and the bill’s House passage.
In one day, the Idaho House and Senate floors widely passed a bill to let ivermectin be sold as an over-the-counter medicine.
Typically used to treat parasites in humans, ivermectin has drawn interest since the COVID pandemic — after largely conservative activists, doctors and politicians inaccurately touted it as an alternative medicine. 
The U.S. Food and Drug and Administration, or FDA, hasn’t approved ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19, saying the federal agency finds existing clinical trial data don’t show “ivermectin is effective against COVID 19 in humans.”
Idaho’s Senate Bill 1211 would let ivermectin be sold over-the-counter, without a prescription or consultation with a health care professional.
Supporters argue making ivermectin more widely available for human use would avoid people buying versions of the drug intended for animals, and it would make human use safer by providing more information on appropriate doses. 
Idaho lawmakers didn’t hear public feedback on the bill from doctors, pharmacists or health care professionals.
In arguments supporting the bill, Idaho Republican lawmakers often leaned into national rhetoric that inaccurately suggests ivermectin is a medical cure-all drug. That portrayal conflicts with national medical guidance that supports ivermectin in limited applications.
Dr. Sky Blue, who works with ivermectin in his practice as an infectious disease doctor in Idaho, told the Idaho Capital Sun the bill is part of a broader trend to promote unproven medical remedies and disregard their risks — over more proven treatments. 
“We have had very well done, well-executed and favorable clinical trials showing that paxlovid, molnupiravir and remdesivir have positive effects (as anti-viral COVID treatments),” Blue said in a Tuesday interview. “And all the studies with ivermectin have not shown to have benefit,” adding that severe toxicities have been found in ivermectin’s COVID use. 
Rep. Faye Thompson, R-McCall, said she recently went to a local feed store hoping to buy ivermectin for herself and her family to use, but stopped out of confusion over the appropriate dose. 
Usually, the FDA handles whether drugs should be made available over-the-counter, a process that uses data on safety and effectiveness.

 In the House, only 1 lawmaker voted against the bill. Several Democrats supported it. 

On Thursday, the bill cleared both chambers of the Idaho Legislature, which appears to be approaching the final days of its 2025 legislative session. 
In the Senate, the bill passed on a 25-9 vote. In the House, it passed with 66 votes in support and just a single vote in opposition: by Rep. Steve Berch, D-Boise. 
Debating in favor of the bill, Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, drew a comparison with medical marijuana.
“It’s the same argument. … There are people who believe that it works, that it is a better way of dealing with pain,” he argued. 
The bill now heads to Idaho Gov. Brad Little for final consideration.

If Idaho’s ivermectin deregulation bill becomes law, it would take effect immediately — through an emergency clause.
When the bill is transmitted to the governor, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.
The bill is cosponsored by the top Republicans in the Idaho House and Senate — Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star — along with two other lawmakers: Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, and Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene.

 Pharmacies won’t be ready, Idaho industry representative testifies

One of only two people to testify in support of the fast-moving bill, an Idaho pharmacy industry representative testified that without an over-the-counter label, pharmacies can’t sell ivermectin over the counter. 
The bill does not direct drug manufacturers to develop such a label, which could warn about the drug’s risks if used in too high of doses, or ivermectin’s interactions with other medications. 
The FDA warns large doses of ivermectin “can be dangerous.” Overdoses can risk death, the federal regulator’s website says, and human-appropriate doses can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners. 
Two states allow ivermectin to be sold over-the-counter, according to local news reports: Arkansas passed a law this year, and Tennessee passed a law three years ago. North Carolina is considering a similar bill.
 Many Idaho Republican senators tap into ivermectin cure-all rhetoric — conflicting with medical guidance

When he pitched the bill in committee on Wednesday, bill cosponsor Anthon appeared to tap into the broader national rhetoric, saying ivermectin has been called a “wonder drug.”
“This is a drug that has had really immeasurable impacts on improving the lives of billions and billions of people throughout the world since it was discovered. It’s been called, in many places, a wonder drug,” Anthon, the top Idaho Senate Republican, told lawmakers in committee. “It’s been able to serve in treating and in many ways curing human diseases — treating parasites, worms in humans. And in most countries, it is legal over the counter.”
The Senate passed the bill on a 25-9 vote Thursday, sending the bill to the House. Five of the Senate’s six Democrats opposed the bill, joined by four Republicans; Democratic Sen. Ali Rabe, from Boise, was absent. 
 Sen. Tammy Nichols touts ivermectin as cure-all. Doctors, FDA disagree.

In opening arguments for the bill on the Senate floor, Nichols spoke for about seven minutes — out of the roughly 35-minute debate. 
She listed a range of ailments people have used ivermectin for.
“Some people will use it like taking vitamins,” Nichols told lawmakers.
Anthon has said the bill would mean people aren’t turning to veterinarian sources to find the drug, arguing patients could use it more safely with better dosing information.
Stressing he wasn’t a doctor or pharmacist, Sen. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls, said the doctors and pharmacists he’d talked with say making ivermectin available without a prescription is “not a good idea because there is no testing yet. … We don’t know all the benefits or the faults of it.”

Debating in favor of the bill, Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, incorrectly claimed the FDA never fully approved a COVID vaccine.
“If we’re using the FDA as the benchmark for what’s approved or not approved, if you trust that, I believe that — I don’t think the COVID shot ever got out of emergency use authorization. That was never approved by the FDA, as far as I’m concerned,” Bjerke told the Senate. 
In 2021, the FDA approved Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine — which was the first COVID vaccine to advance past emergency use authorization. 
 Some committee members worried about lack of doctor input

The lack of input from medical experts drew consternation from some lawmakers on the Senate State Affairs Committee, which spent about a half hour considering the bill on Wednesday.

In committee, Sen. Treg Bernt, R-Meridian, said he wanted to talk to a couple doctors about the bill. But he repeatedly suggested the bill’s risk wasn’t high.
“I’m not a tin-hat-wearing legislator. I’m not a conspiracy theorist. I think we’re going to be OK with ivermectin,” he said. “I’m not — certainly wouldn’t be against it, I guess. But I just … want to know more about it.”
On Thursday, Bernt voted for the bill on the Senate floor. 
The committee’s only Democrat, Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said he’d oppose the bill. He said the drug is being politicized.
“Political reasons are not a good basis for making a decision to make a prescription drug an over-the-counter drug,” Ruchti said in committee. “That decision should be driven by the science. It should be driven by data and research. And we have none of that in front of us.”

The committee’s chairman, Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCannon, said he’d oppose the bill in committee but he might change his mind later.
His younger brother took ivermectin when he got COVID, and “he thought he was going to die,” Guthrie told the committee.
“Now, was that the ivermectin or advanced COVID? Who knows. But he felt like it could have very, very well been the ivermectin. Did he think that if a little’s good, a lot will do better? Possibly. And maybe that’s … the risk you take when you don’t have that consultation,” Guthrie said. 
Guthrie opposed the bill on the Senate floor, joined by four other Republican lawmakers: Sens. Van Burtenshaw, from Terreton; Cook; and Dave Lent, from Idaho Falls. 
 What the committee heard: Opposition from pharmacy industry representative, and support from attorney

Only two people testified on the bill:

Brian Festa, an attorney who is the co-founder of the nonprofit Caldwell-based public interest law firm We The Patriots USA. Saying he represented himself, Festa testified briefly in support of the bill. He referenced a lawsuit his law firm was involved in over a Minnesota patient’s struggle to get ivermectin as a need for the bill. 
And Pam Eaton, the CEO of the Idaho Retailers Association which represents Idaho pharmacies. In the past eight hours, she told the committee she’d heard from more pharmacists than she’d heard from throughout this year’s Idaho legislative session, adding that 99% of people she’d heard from were opposed to the bill. 

Eaton said without an over-the-counter label, pharmacies can’t sell ivermectin over-the-counter. Some might be able to, but she said most are saying they can’t.
Throughout her testimony, Eaton stressed she is not a pharmacist. But she relayed patient safety concerns she said she’d heard from a pharmacist about ivermectin.
“It has serious interactions with five medications, and requires close monitoring with 51 medications, including commonly used antibiotics, cholesterol, heart medications and other (over-the-counter) antihistamines,” Eaton said. 
That’s the sort of information that would be on an over-the-counter medication label, she added.

[&#8230;]","State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha. Aug. 15, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After anger, threats of stalling legislation and accusations of discrimination, the Unicameral on Thursday resurrected a priority bill by State Sen. Terrell McKinney to help keep at-risk youths out of jail. It’s now part of another proposal that advanced.
Earlier in the day, McKinney’s Legislative Bill 48 was doused on a 22-14 vote. Eleven lawmakers marked present but not voting.
That led the North Omaha legislator to call opponents hypocrites. He said they claim to “care about kids” but are more interested in “keeping up with the status quo” and “keeping black kids in the system.”
 ‘Because he is Black or a Democrat’ 

His priority bill calls for an around-the-clock Family Resource and Juvenile Assessment Center pilot program in Omaha. The goal is two sites that address family dynamics, mental health, substance abuse and educational challenges contributing to juvenile delinquency.
  State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The effort would integrate “culturally relevant services delivered by and for the communities served.” Subject to available funds, up to $1 million annually for five years would come from a Medicaid cash fund.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, after the earlier vote that sank LB 48, promised not to sit down until lawmakers “fixed” the McKinney situation. She said she believed opponents have been unfairly dismissing his ideas.
“I don’t know if it’s because he is Black or a Democrat,” Cavanaugh said, imploring certain colleagues to “have a frickin’ backbone.”
During later debate on a different bill, State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln helped revive McKinney’s pilot program. The rescue came in the form of a floor amendment attached to an aging services-related proposal championed by State Sen. Glen Meyer of Pender.
Meyer’s LB 382, which had seen little opposition, proposes to direct $4 million over two years from a Medicaid cash fund to keep afloat activities and services offered by the state’s eight designated agencies for the aging. That includes nutritional programs such as Meals-On-Wheels.
The floor amendment that revived McKinney’s pilot program passed 27-7, picking up six new Republican votes and losing one from State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney.

Four of those six additions had sat out the first vote — Speaker John Arch of La Vista and State Sens. Myron Dorn of Adams, Jana Hughes of Seward and Mike Jacobson of North Platte — while the other two, State Sens. Mike Moser of Columbus and Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, originally voted “no.”
Meyer’s revised LB 382, including McKinney’s proposal, moved on to the next phase of debate with a 37-2 vote. 
Meyer, a member of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, was part of the group that advanced McKinney’s pilot program bill out of committee and onto debate. But after that he voted twice against it, including when it was being attached to his LB 382.
 ‘Unnecessary bureacracy’ 

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston was among those who remained opposed to the McKinney pilot program partly because of its cost. He also said Omaha has various nonprofits devoted to youths that already seek to curb juvenile delinquency.
Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, another opponent, said she’d prefer to see a comprehensive assessment of all Omaha-area programs available for at-risk youth. She views the McKinney-backed Family Resource and Juvenile Assessment pilot program as “unnecessary bureaucracy.”
Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha called it “foolish” not to embrace programs that intervene in a youth’s life on the front end rather than pay back end costs such as incarceration.
  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston. Aug. 16, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
McKinney said his pilot program was supported by law enforcement groups with whom he is typically at odds. He said his priority bill was a preventative effort to provide mentoring, mental health care, parenting and other support before youths sink into trouble.
It comes at a time when other public officials, including Riepe and Gov. Jim Pillen, are pushing to lower the age at which youth offenders can be detained and charged as adults. Riepe’s priority bill, LB 556, would lower the age at which a Nebraska youth could be detained for an alleged crime from 13 to 11, and it would drop the age at which a minor could be charged as an adult for the “most serious” felonies from 14 to 12.
McKinney argues adamantly that the Legislature should be doing more to prevent youths from going down the wrong path, one he said costs taxpayers more.

At a brief meeting of the Montana Board of Regents this week, Chairman Todd Buchanan said “enthusiasm was palpable” during a visit last week by two finalists for “clearly one of the more important jobs in the state.”
The finalists include a former dean at the University of Montana.
“It was really exciting to see the quality of folks seeking this opportunity,” Buchanan said.
One finalist is Dr. Kurt Schnier, vice chancellor for planning and budget and the chief financial officer at the University of California, Merced, according to a news release from the MSU search committee. It said Schnier also is a professor of economics there.
The other finalist is Dr. Brock Tessman, president of Northern Michigan University and former dean of the Davidson Honors College at the University of Montana in Missoula. The news release said Tessman also has been an associate professor and assistant professor at the University of Georgia’s Department of International Affairs. He also served as served as the Deputy Commissioner of Higher Education overseeing the 16 campuses that comprise the Montana University System.
In August 2024, MSU President Waded Cruzado announced she would retire in June 2025 after 15 years in the role. MSU is the largest public institution in the state of Montana.
In an email Thursday, Galen Hollenbaugh, with the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, said a decision should be made soon, although a timeline isn’t set.
“The Montana State University Presidential Search Advisory Committee and the Board of Regents are moving closer to a decision, but the process is ongoing and the timeline for an announcement remains in flux,” Hollenbaugh said.
The Board of Regents went into a closed, executive session after a brief update of the search process to discuss the finalists.
“We have determined that the discussion of the finalists involves individual privacy rights that outweigh the public’s right to know, and we are closing the session to ensure confidentiality,” Buchanan said.
Buchanan said the visits by the top two candidates came after a “robust and thoughtful vetting process,” which included numerous interviews. He said on campus, both finalists met with staff, faculty, students, alumni and the public.

(Photo by Hal Bernton)The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has long struggled to compete with corporate America to recruit tech workers to maintain the complicated computer systems that track the federal seafood harvests off Alaska.
These chronic staffing shortages at NOAA Fisheries’ Alaska Region have been greatly exacerbated by the Trump administration’s efforts to cut the federal workforce.
As of mid-March, the Alaska Region had 29% of its staffing positions vacant, and the Information Services Division, staffed largely by tech workers, had a vacancy rate of 45%, according to an internal agency memorandum obtained by the Alaska Beacon.
The memorandum offers a window into the impacts of the Trump administration downsizing campaign on the agency’s Alaska Region, which plays a vital role in overseeing federal harvests in a nearly 1.5 million square mile swath of the North Pacific that produce about half of the fish caught in U.S. waters. The memorandum states that the region is “evaluating core functions necessary to maintain minimal functionality to keep the fisheries operating…we are aligning existing staffing resources to maintain and ‘keep the lights on.’ “
That task will likely become more challenging in the weeks ahead.
NOAA Fisheries is part of the Commerce Department, which has been instructed by a Trump executive order to shrink its federal workforce in a quest to “eliminate waste, bloat and insularity.”
Some NOAA Fisheries workers who had not completed a probationary period of employment already are off the job. They were let go earlier this year, then placed on paid administrative leave after a judge, in response to a lawsuit, found fault with that move.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department is encouraging employees with long years of federal service to take early retirement. Others can leave and collect “lump sum” exit payments of up to $25,000, according to a copy of the NOAA offer obtained by the Beacon. Employees have until April 17 to decide whether they want to leave NOAA Fisheries voluntarily. If they do not, they will still face the risk of getting laid off at a later date by a reduction in force, according to the offer. As the deadline for voluntary departures approaches, staff members say that morale has eroded. Some who had considered staying are opting to leave as they confront expanded workloads with less support. Three current federal workers who spoke with the Alaska Beacon declined to comment publicly due to concerns about retaliation, but said that there was fear among frontline workers and one worker said that extended to leadership.
The responsibilities of the NOAA Fisheries Alaska region include enforcement of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, marine conservation, and collecting and managing catch data. The regional offices also work closely with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, which is charged with carrying out much of the fishery survey work and also has been slammed by staff losses.
The Trump administration cuts to NOAA Fisheries alarm Bill Tweit, vice chair of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, a federal advisory group that develops harvest policies for the 200-mile U.S. fishery zone off Alaska.  As climate change intensifies, the council faces an increasingly challenging task of helping to manage the fisheries. And if Alaska staff cuts substantially weaken NOAA Fisheries’ scientific capabilities, then he expects the council may consider tighter harvest limits.
“‘That’s because the less information we have – the more conservative we have to be,” said Tweit, a Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife official who has served on the council for almost two decades.

Sources within the Alaska regional office say some of the  greatest concern is focused on the Alaska Region’s Information Services Division. The division staff support an aging computer system, and   “Development work to improve our IT (Information Technology) systems is particularly at risk,” said the Alaska Region internal memorandum, which stated that the division’s vacancy rate will soon reach 55%.
The computer division tracks the progress of a multitude of harvests, along with the bycatch of accidentally caught species. Accurate tallying of the rapidly changing harvest totals is essential to preventing overfishing in derby-style fisheries, such as the Gulf of Alaska pollock harvest,  which have boat crews who race to grab as much fish as possible before a fleet-wide quota is reached. 
In a public document filed March 28 with the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the Alaska Region listed eight of the staff who were “lost,” including two supervisors and a  software developer from the Information Services Division.

“This will be a new paradigm, less staff and less capacity,” Kurland said in testimony to the council. “I can say we will have limitations and delays in delivering things that council and stakeholders are expecting…. Our staff have been under quite a lot of stress, and they have really been touched by numerous, very kind acknowledgements of their public service.”
In later remarks to the council, Kurland said “we are expecting to see some further big changes, and those changes will have impacts on the services that we can provide. But…. I really can’t go into any more detail than that at this point.
Also on Thursday, Bob Foy, director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, testified to the council. He noted staff losses, travel restrictions and an effort to keep “any of the core balls from being dropped.”
“That’s really the space we are in right now. A heck of a lot of uncertainty,” Foy said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate Education Committee advanced a number of bills impacting both K-12 and higher education on Thursday, ensuring they will remain active as the session’s second funnel deadline looms.
Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said during the committee meeting the group will have one more meeting early next week, but will focus on appointments instead of policy.
K-12 education
The first bill discussed during committee, and one of the most contested of the day, was House File 884, which would allow public and nonpublic school districts to bring in a chaplain to work with students. It states in the legislation that schools cannot “require or coerce a student to utilize” chaplains’ services and bars chaplains from being used as guidance counselors.
An amendment from Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, to prohibit chaplains from proselytizing on school grounds, failed. Sen. Mike Pike, R-Des Moines, floor manager for the bill, submitted an amendment to require chaplains be mandatory reporters and “have a certification from a nationally recognized school Chaplain professional credentializing organization,” he said, which passed.
Senate democrats voiced concerns about the amendment limiting who would be allowed to work with a district as a chaplain, with Trone Garriott saying the only organization providing the necessary credentials is a Christian advocacy group that would not allow those who don’t follow its goals to receive credentials.
“State sanctioned Christian indoctrination,” said Sen. Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Cedar Rapids. “That’s what this is about.”

Once passed, the bill as a whole also caused worries for Trone Garriott and others. She said being a chaplain is hard work that is not for everyone, and this legislation would allow “untrained, unvetted, unsupervised individuals” into their children’s schools and gives them a title and authority.
“It is a groomer’s dream to have access to our children this way, to have this authority, and then to be able to come in and operate with no guidance and no guidelines and no oversight,” Trone Garriott said.
Pike said the bill would give control back to local school districts, and to the communities within them, to decide for themselves whether they’d like to have a chaplain working with students.
“If the parents and the district chooses not to be involved with the chaplains, then they’re not going to be,” Pike said. “But if the district chooses so, then they will, with the agreement of the parents. The parents always have a say in their school board.”
House File 785 would modify rules for charter school boards to allow no more than one board member to reside outside of Iowa, but would require that all members be U.S. citizens.
Sens. Mike Zimmer and Herman Quirmbach expressed concerns that allowing people living outside of the state could take control away from the people who utilize the school.
“I do believe that one individual from outside of the state sitting on that board could have an undue influence,” Zimmer said.
Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, said in closing comments the legislation will be useful to the charter schools located close to Iowa’s borders. There are no such constraints in place for nonprofit boards, he added, calling into question why school boards should need one.
“There’s only three states right now that have restrictions on board memberships, and so we’re pretty unique in that we’re requiring only in-state board memberships,” Green said.
The committee moved the legislation ahead with a vote of 11 to 5.
House File 189 would set requirements for public school districts with nonpublic school students wishing to participate in extracurricular athletics. Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, said it would require school districts to allow students living in the district but attending a nonpublic school to participate in athletics provided by the district but not the nonpublic school in the past two years.
Trone Garriott called the legislation a “one-way bill,” as it does not allow students from public schools to join sports only offered by the nonpublic school in the district.
“It’s really inappropriate that even though we’re funding both school systems, only one student gets to pick and choose from all of the available opportunities while our public school students are shut out,” Trone Garriott said. “This is inherently unfair.”
The legislation passed with an 11-5 vote.
Four pieces of legislation were passed unanimously during the committee meeting, aimed at making those allowed to direct students with concussions to sit out of activities and school district budgets more flexible.
House File 471 would add those with a doctorate in psychology and specialized training in concussion management or neuropsychology to the category of licensed health professionals who can direct a student to be removed from an extracurricular activity due to showing signs or symptoms of a concussion or brain injury.
House File 579 would allow the modified supplemental amount ratio school districts can levy for dropout prevention programs to go up to 5%, Sen. Tom Shipley, R-Nodaway, said, if approved at an election. It cannot increase by more than .5% every fiscal year.
House File 316 would make changes to career education and exploration in K-12 schools, Evans said, including expanding career planning curriculum to fifth and sixth grades and adding additional criteria for career education in seventh and eighth grades.
The bill would also have the Iowa Department of Education form a list of industry recognized credentials, create a seal and provide it to schools to add onto student transcripts and other documents if they have earned a credential before graduating.
House File 315 would make school districts impacted by a natural disaster eligible for an additional year of budget guarantees, Evans said. No districts would have need of this adjustment the majority of the time, he said, but it would help those who have.
Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said the bill needs to move forward and urged its adoption. A similar version of the House bill, Senate File 64, has been assigned a subcommittee in the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
Higher Education
House File 295 would prohibit higher education accrediting bodies from taking negative actions against state universities and community colleges for following, or refusing to violate, state law, like eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programming that an accreditor may require.
If an accreditor does take an action against an Iowa university, the institution can seek authorization from the Iowa attorney general to file a civil suit against the body.
Winckler and Quirmbach pointed out the removal of any mention of the Higher Learning Commission, an accrediting body they said provides accreditation to 51 colleges and universities in Iowa, from the legislation, and said taking it out allows for universities to use lower-quality accreditors.
“I can’t support the bill. I think it dumbs down our higher education system,” Winckler said. “I think that with the possible elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, it puts us and any of our higher learning institutions in a very precarious situation.”
Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, agreed with Winckler that accreditation is important, and added that this bill will protect it. Names in the bill aren’t important, he said, as new accreditors may come down the line later on.
It passed 11-5 and will head to the Senate calendar for debate.
House File 401 would set new general education requirements for Iowa’s public universities, mandating a certain number of credit hours be taken in English, math and statistics, American and western heritage, natural and social sciences and the humanities.
While the bill states instructors’ academic freedoms and the freedom to discuss ideas in the classroom will not be infringed upon, it also states general education courses cannot “distort significant historical events or include any curriculum or other material that teaches identity politics or is based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, or privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States of America or the state of Iowa.”
Lawmakers said in a subcommittee meeting Wednesday they anticipate amendments will need to be added to the legislation.
Quirmbach said universities are perfectly able to set their own standards for general education, and the Legislature would probably do a much worse job at it. Echoing comments he made in the subcommittee meeting, he said including “identity politics” without a definition would throw educators into “complete chaos.”
He would also like to know what is expected to be excluded from education due to the section about systemic oppression, bringing up slavery and its inclusion in the Constitution as an example.
“Our history is one of institutions that have supported sexism and racism, oppression and privilege, and if we are going to require a course on American heritage, we cannot, we cannot, honestly avoid those topics,” Quirmbach said.
If the argument from the subcommittee persists that the language is in the present rather than the past tense, Quirmbach said it could then bar instructors from speaking about the Legislature removing transgender protections from Iowa Civil Rights code this session.
Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, provided his own definition of “identity politics” — “identity politics politicizes certain demographic traits, thereby defining people by their sex, race, sexual orientation and so on, and prioritizing public policy issues on that basis.”
While there were systems of sexism, racism and oppression in the U.S. 200 years ago, Taylor said that is not the case today and that is why it is barred in the bill.
“I’m not saying that there isn’t racism, that there isn’t sexism, that there isn’t oppression or privilege — all of those things still exist, but they are not institutionalized,” Taylor said.
The bill passed with an 11-5 vote.
House File 440 would direct the state higher education system to study the pros and cons of implementing a tuition freeze for first-year students so they won’t see increases during their first four years of study, as well as set tuition prices for the upcoming year by April 30.
Universities would also be required to develop three-year baccalaureate degree programs and work study programs for students working part-time while attending classes paid for by their employer.
An amendment introduced by Quirmbach to provide an exception to the April 30 deadline if the Legislature has not yet approved higher education appropriations failed to pass.
Green thanked Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, for his work on the bill in his closing comments, and it moved ahead to the Senate calendar.
House File 856 would bar state entities from spending any money, from public funding or otherwise, on opening or maintaining DEI offices or officers. Community colleges are included in the legislation as well as private universities, who would risk Iowa Tuition Grant ineligibility if they do not comply.
Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, introduced an amendment to strike the division dealing with private universities from the legislation, which passed unanimously.
Quirmbach and Zimmer reiterated concerns during the meeting they expressed on the Senate Floor during debate on Senate File 507. Zimmer said the use of the word “promote” could bar local and state government departments from encouraging good initiatives aimed at getting more women into male-dominated fields, and Quirmbach said entities could potentially be stopped from celebrating Black History Month and other established events.
“This bill, more than anything else I think, suppresses freedom of free speech, it suppresses freedom of opinion…,” Quirmbach said. “It’s one of the saddest pieces of legislation I’ve seen coming along.”
Rozenboom said this legislation is in line with others considered last session, and it “addresses a problem that needs to be addressed.” While the definition of DEI in the bill is a wide-ranging one, and one he said that is “what you make of it,” but added it is well thought-out and gets to the core of the issue he sees.
“It is not the proper place of a state entity to promote ideologies and opinions as their official role,” Rozenboom said.
The legislation passed with an 11-5 vote.

Free.,"U.S. Senate GOP moves ahead with budget resolution, setting up final vote this weekend",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-moves-ahead-budget-resolution-setting-final-vote-weekend,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday advanced a budget resolution that, once approved by both chambers of Congress, will pave the way for trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts.The 52-48 vote moved senators one step closer to a marathon amendment voting session, which will likely take place Friday or Saturday, before they give the budget their final stamp of approval. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul was the only member of his party to vote against moving forward.The House will have to vote to adopt the revised budget resolution in order to unlock the complex reconciliation process that GOP leaders plan to use to enact an extension of the 2017 tax law, hundreds of billions in new funding for border security and defense, and substantial cuts to federal spending.The compromise budget resolution, released Wednesday, will also clear the way for Republicans to raise the debt limit later this year by between $4 and $5 trillion.The tax-and-spending blueprint is not a bill and never goes to the president for a signature. It’s what’s known as a concurrent resolution, so only the House and Senate need to approve it for its provisions to take effect.Once GOP lawmakers do that, they can move their sweeping policy goals through the Senate without garnering the support of at least 60 lawmakers to move past the legislative filibuster.That means GOP leaders won’t need to negotiate any part of the yet-to-be-drafted reconciliation bill with Democrats, only the various factions that make up the party.But that will prove a challenging task given their especially narrow majorities.In the House, there are only 220 GOP members at the moment, a much smaller number than when the original tax law package passed during Trump’s first administration.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can only lose three Republicans on partisan bills if all members of the chamber are voting. There are currently two absences, but if that changes before Congress clears the bill, Johnson’s margins might shift slightly.Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate and can lose only three members on the reconciliation package, if Vice President J.D. Vance is available to break a tied vote.",,,,2025-04-03 20:02:46.120772

Much of the discussion around the resolution centered on whether to delay a vote on the controversial proposal made by board member Christina Boggess. There were questions about specific examples of Utah schools not complying with a 2024 law restricting DEI efforts in all public institutions, and also whether a rule, and not a resolution, would be a more appropriate path to eliminate DEI programs. 
LeAnn Wood, a board member who supported postponing the discussion indefinitely, said she worried about the hundreds of calls and emails she received from constituents in her district about the resolution. That much angst, she said, indicates something is not right.

“I don’t think a resolution is the answer. If we need to define what compliance looks like, then we need to do that,” she said. “We need to do our job. We do not need a political statement of what we think should be happening.”
Boggess, however, pushed back against an indefinite postponement.
“I think we’re giving the proverbial middle finger to the Legislature,” Boggess said. “I think we’re giving the proverbial middle finger to our federal agencies who have spoken very boldly on these issues and have asked us to address them.” 
Utah State Board of Education to consider resolution tying DEI programs to communist goals 

The draft, which had been controversial among Utahns for tying DEI programs to communist goals, was updated to eliminate references to communism and to make distinctions for special education programs, among other provisions. But, ultimately, like all of the proposed actions to postpone the discussion, the resolution failed.
A couple of members from Latinos in Action, a nonprofit that offers a year-long elective course aimed to bridging opportunity and graduation gaps for Latino students, spoke against the resolution during the meeting’s public comment section. 
Christian Hernandez, a social studies teacher, highlighted how immigrants have vastly contributed to innovation in the country and why programs like Latinos in Action are necessary to provide leadership tools and academic support for students who may feel overlooked. 
“The notion that programs like (Latinos in Action) are Soviet style is divisive and misleading,” Hernandez said. “Programs like this embody the very spirit of America, and how we can become leaders promoting progress and opportunity.”
  Utah State Board of Education votes on an anti-DEI resolution on April 3, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)
Under Utah’s anti-DEI law, affinity and cultural groups in public institutions are still permitted as long as they don’t exclude anyone based on their race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion or gender identity. However, according to Hernandez, the program would have to be eliminated if the resolution passed.
However, Boggess pointed to an addition to the draft made by Utah’s congressional delegation, she said: “Without a firm directive to comply with the Executive Order, the State of Utah stands to lose Federal Funding for education,” the newest version of the resolution states.
And, she said the resolution had to be considered seriously, since she’s personally aware of over 100 complaints of DEI violations in Utah schools made in a U.S. Department of Education online portal. 
Board members also raised other concerns about the resolution. 
“​​This appears to be a rule dressed as a resolution,” said member Joseph Kerry, questioning whether approving it would go against the board’s policies.
It would actually violate two of their policies, a member of the board’s legal counsel said — backing a resolution that mandates something to happen as if it were a rule, and the board’s policy on policies, which dictates that all board policies are binding. 
Should the U.S. Department of Education be dismantled? 
The majority of the board also voted against signing a letter of intent addressed to President Donald Trump, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and the Utah congressional delegation to allow the state to manage federal dollars for education purposes.



Let us know what you think...


 


“I think there’s nothing wrong with us saying, ‘if you’re going this direction, we’ve got the qualifications to do this,’” member Jennie Earl said. “I think this also lets the legislature know we can do this.”
But, that proposal also failed despite some attempts to make it shorter and “less disparaging” to federally-managed programs, according to board member Carol Lear. 
But, still, after the Utah Legislature rejected to fund some items the board deemed important for Utah students, many of the members said they don’t trust the state to protect some programs that are managed at the federal level.
Lear cited programs like Utah Fits All, the school voucher program that the state’s largest teacher union is challenging in court for its constitutionality, and a 2025 bill that — before it was vetoed — would have rerouted property tax revenue for schools into the state general fund. 
She also fears for programs like the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, which provides students experiencing homelessness with equal access to public education.
“That’s not going to be a popular use of funds for either the state or for individual LEAs, so I am one very grateful person that those children are served directly by federal regulations,” Lear said.
Other members, like Boggess, said that while they believe government is best when it is closer to the people, they still were skeptical about the move, especially because it would imply that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would take over Department of Education tasks 
“It presents this conundrum wherein we advocate for the abolition of an agency which only redirects to an agency that is not an expert in education,” Boggess said.

Free.,"Contempt finding possible for Trump officials behind deportation flights, judge says",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/contempt-finding-possible-trump-officials-behind-deportation-flights-judge-says,,"WASHINGTON — Judge James E. Boasberg on Thursday strongly implied there was probable cause that the Trump administration violated his orders over deportation flights carried out under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.“It seems to me ... that the government acted in bad faith throughout that day,” he said of March 15, when the administration sent three flights of Venezuelan nationals to a notorious El Salvador mega-prison and seemingly defied his order to return them.“If you believed everything you did was legal, I can't believe you would have operated the way you did that day,” Boasberg said to Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general who is representing the administration in the case.An order of contempt could come as soon as next week, Boasberg said. He said if he finds the government in contempt, there would be hearings to determine the official, or officials, who defied his order and the possible consequences of those actions.Contempt would allow Boasberg to issue a fine against certain officials in order to force compliance or he even to order U.S. marshals to jail an official.During Thursday's hearing, Boasberg questioned why the proclamation was signed “in secret,” noting it was put into use before a judge could review it.“Is there any other inference (than) that there was an expedited effort to get people on planes…before my hearing,” Boasberg asked, referring to a March 15 hearing that ended with the judge placing the temporary restraining order blocking the use of the law.For more than an hour Thursday, Boasberg grilled Ensign about the timing of three deportation flights after the wartime law was invoked.In the order, Boasberg also required the return of any mid-air flights to the U.S.But rather than return the flights, the government delivered more than 261 men to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador known as CECOT. Boasberg questioned Ensign on which government officials were aware his temporary restraining order was in place and asked for the name of the person who decided not to turn the flights around.Ensign said he was not sure and then cited attorney-client privileges, which Boasberg seemed skeptical about. Ensign then said he was not aware of who made the decision to not turn the flights around.The Trump administration has denied it violated any orders and has said that it followed the law.Contempt hearings possibleBoasberg asked American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt what process for a contempt finding they would recommend.Gelernt said having the government write sworn declarations answering pointed questions and having officials questioned under oath would be acceptable steps.“We feel the order was violated,” Gelernt said. ACLU has already filed for a preliminary injunction while the case proceeds.In the motion for a preliminary injunction, ACLU argued that the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act violates administrative and immigration laws and constitutional rights to due process.“Plaintiffs will suffer severe and irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction, as demonstrated by class members who have already been removed and consigned to a life sentence in a Salvadoran prison without … notice or the opportunity to contest the government’s designation,” according to the brief.A hearing for a preliminary injunction is set for April 8.The Trump administration on March 28 made an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to allow for deportations under the wartime law – something that until now, had only been used during wars: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. A decision from the high court is expected soon.Seeking informationPresident Donald Trump has publicly attacked Boasberg, calling for his impeachment. The Justice Department has also tried to have Boasberg removed from the case.Attorney General Pam Bondi invoked the “state secrets privilege” late last month to refuse to answer Boasberg’s detailed questions about the flights.Boasberg rejected that argument in Thursday's hearing, asking Ensign if the information was classified.Ensign said it was not classified.Boasberg then questioned why the Trump administration refused to show him the information he was seeking, as is common in cases with sensitive information such as national security details.There are specific rooms called Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIFs, where sensitive information can be discussed with officials, such as a federal judge.Boasberg said the administration was acting “pretty sketchily"" in not showing him the information. In various hearings, Boasberg has expressed doubt that the Trump administration can use the wartime law to deport Venezuelans accused of gang ties without due process. Boasberg has agreed that the president has broad authority over foreign policy and deportations, but has deemed deportations can’t be done without due process.Aside from determining if the Trump administration violated his restraining order with the deportation flights, Boasberg is trying to determine if the president violated the Alien Enemies Act by deporting Venezuelans without proper judicial review.Department of Justice attorneys have argued that those subject to the Alien Enemies Act do not need to be notified. Instead, they argue anyone subject to the proclamation who wants to challenge it can make a habeas corpus claim – that is, challenge the legality of their detentions.Flights to El SalvadorAt issue are three deportation planes that eventually went to the prison in El Salvador on March 15. Two of the planes left before Boasberg gave a verbal order to pause deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.One plane left after Boasberg issued a written order, but the Trump administration has said those on the third flight had removal orders under Title 8, not the wartime law.Ensign said the proclamation was signed on March 14, but didn’t go into effect until the next day.Boasberg questioned how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was able to have enough time to load up three planes and deport Venezuelans under the proclamation if they only knew about it that day.Ensign conceded that ICE likely was preparing for the proclamation ahead of time.“If that’s true, one could infer, they were working on the proclamation before it was public,” Boasberg said.Boasberg also noted public comments the president made, where Trump said he wasn’t sure who or when the proclamation was signed.Ensign said he had not seen the press conference during which the president made those remarks.Deportation errorsBoasberg questioned Ensign about who was notified when he first placed the temporary restraining order. Ensign stuttered and seemed uncomfortable, and said he could not remember. Boasberg gave him time to recall.Ensign listed off members of his DOJ team and points of contact at the State Department and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.Boasberg again noted the “rushed” nature of the flights and how the government has erred in deporting people, including a Maryland father who originally from El Salvador who was sent to prison due to what ICE and DOJ have called an “administrative error.”Boasberg also noted that eight women and one Nicaraguan national were returned from the March 15 flights because the prison was only for men and El Salvador was only taking Venezuelans and their own nationals.Boasberg asked Ensign why the Trump administration would “risk putting people on these planes that should not be on (the) planes.”Ensign said he didn’t have specific operational details.Family members and attorneys for many of the men have disputed the Trump administration's claims that those taken to El Salvador were members of the Tren de Aragua. They claim the men were deported because ICE agents misinterpreted their tattoos. Many deportees had no criminal record and were in asylum hearings before an immigration judge, they added.",,,,2025-04-03 20:02:46.120772

The Crowley Act was first introduced in 1997 and lets the state education department seize control of underperforming school districts. The act’s sparse instructions for state intervention — about 380 words in all — is not exactly adored by present-day lawmakers, its unpopularity concentrated in the capital city of Providence, where the school system’s many stakeholders continue to lament the state’s 2019 seizure of its schools. 
“I am one of three councilors back in 2019 that actually testified against the takeover by the state,” said Providence City Councilor Helen Anthony at a meeting Wednesday of the Rhode Island Senate Committee on Education. “One of the reasons that I was strongly in opposition to the takeover was because of the Crowley Act itself. It was woefully inadequate, in my opinion still is, in what it does [and] doesn’t do.”
Anthony was testifying in support of two bills, S0860 and S0861, by Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat who previously visited city councilors to discuss his plans to codify a better receivership model should state takeovers happen again. The bills belong to a suite of four pieces of legislation crafted during a special legislative study commission led by Zurier in 2023 and 2024 that sought new ways to structure the relationship between the many stakeholders in the Providence public school system.
Zurier’s tweaks to the state’s framework for intervention are based on the Springfield Empowerment Zone in neighboring Massachusetts, where a school district staved off state control through a radical revision of teachers’ union contracts.
“That vision, I am pleased to report, is union friendly,” Zurier said of the Springfield initiative, noting that 96% of the district’s unionized teachers approved of the most recent contract.  
Zurier’s bills would apply to Providence only, and would create a statute authorizing a third-party receiver to manage the district, rather than the state doing so directly. The state would appoint the receiver, who would be “a nonprofit entity or an individual with a demonstrated record of success in improving low-performing schools or districts or the academic performance of disadvantaged students,” according to one of the bill texts.  
The receivership would be authorized for up to three years, and allow the third-party to oversee staffing and budget decisions, teacher renewals and a turnaround plan with clear metrics to determine the takeover’s success. The receiver would also have some power to modify collective bargaining agreements, and Zurier’s bill specifies time periods for contract and dispute arbitration.
The current Crowley Act fails to specify much in its regulation of state takeovers in its two paragraphs on the process of state intervention, compared to the 10 pages of regulations in one of Zurier’s bills.  
 “I know it’s strange to be thinking about amending the Crowley Act when the city of Providence is considering returning to local control, but I think it’s absolutely critical,” Anthony said, arguing that the bills have value for school districts statewide. “Even though this is Providence specific, they will ensure future interventions are more effective, more accountable, and ideally less necessary.”
Former Providence schools superintendent Susan Lusi told senators that Zurier’s bills “will create legal clarity regarding the state’s authority moving forward.”
One example of the Crowley Act’s ambiguities: Last year’s protracted legal battle between the state and Providence in which a judge agreed the city owed at least $15 million to plug up deficits in the state-controlled budget. The parties had contradictory interpretations of the city’s statutory obligations for school funding under the Crowley Act. 
Rather than dismiss the possibility of state control, Zurier’s bill is actually meant to codify a stronger form of receivership, should it happen again.  
“None of this could have happened in Springfield if they weren’t scared of a state takeover under the rigorous Massachusetts law,” Zurier said. “The argument is that you need to have a structure like this in order to…incentivize people to do the right thing.” 
Jeremy Sencer, testifying on behalf of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers, disagreed. 
“We can do many of the things, if not all, of the things that they do in the Springfield Empowerment Zone,” said Sencer, who was part of Zurier’s study commission. “It is possible, but that requires building trust, and we are not going to have trust at the end of a threat. It’s just not going to happen after this takeover…You cannot legislate trust.”

Contemplating alternatives to takeover
Two other Providence Democratic senators on the education committee offered alternate visions of state takeovers. Sen. Jake Bissaillon’s S922 would permit state takeovers but only for individual schools, not entire districts. Union representatives spoke in favor of this approach, which stemmed from Bissaillon’s utter dissatisfaction with the state takeover.  
“What grade would you give the takeover over the last six years?” Bissaillon asked Anthony when she spoke on Zurier’s bill. 
The city councilor gave the takeover a “C,” but when Bissaillon spoke on his bill, he graded it without a curve: “The takeover in 2019 completely foundered…I think I would give it an F for abject failure.” 
Sen. Tiara Mack also offered a school-based solution, with legislation that would require Providence schools to “form local elected school-based councils” at each of the district’s public schools, according to the bill text. 
All four bills were held for further study, which is standard practice.
The same day state senators mused on the mechanics of receivership, the collective voices of Providence public school students were compiled in a document released by OurSchoolsPVD, an assembly of youth-led activist groups that began in 2019 in response to the state takeover.  
The 11-page “community needs” document details the trends and prominent concerns about the city’s schools shared by students themselves at a December event,.
The students’ collected opinions reflected a ground-level vantage point, describing a number of more material and social issues like poor school buildings with mold and falling ceilings, subpar transportation and curriculums that don’t make space for students of different backgrounds or center people of color.  
The report noted that “People are not satisfied with school leadership broadly…They are frustrated by a lack of progress, transparency, accountability, and care for students.”
But the biggest complaint was a general lack of support, which was mentioned 54 times by students who attended the event.
“There is overwhelming agreement that students feel unsupported in school,” the report states.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The lawyer for four Lincoln-area gun owners told the Nebraska Supreme Court during oral arguments Thursday that his clients shouldn’t need to break a Lincoln city ordinance to gain the legal standing to sue and stop a weapons ban on city property.
Jacob Huebert, a Texas-based lawyer for the Liberty Justice Center who represents the Nebraska Firearms Owners Association, argued that all four of his clients have altered their practice of arming themselves when visiting public parks and public spaces because of the ordinance.

Thursday’s case against Lincoln echoes the argument in a separate lawsuit against the City of Omaha over a similar ban. Both lawsuits argue Lincoln and Omaha cannot ban guns in parks, trails and other public spaces because the Legislature outlawed most local gun restrictions with Legislative Bill 77 in 2023.
That law allowed Nebraskans to carry concealed handguns without a permit or state-mandated training. It also curbed some of the power of Nebraska’s larger cities to more stringently regulate guns than Nebraska law does in the rest of the state.
The Omaha case is essentially in a holding pattern in Douglas County District Court after a judge paused enforcement of an executive order from Republican Mayor Jean Stothert, who just advanced Tuesday to the May general election for a fourth term.
Lawyers for both cities have argued that past practice and ordinances and the language of LB 77 itself left room for cities to maintain some ability to restrict weapons on property the cities directly control. Attorney General Mike Hilgers disagreed.
On Thursday, Lincoln City Attorney Yohance Christie argued, as he had in his brief, that the people suing lacked standing because they had not broken the law and the city had not prosecuted anyone for the offense. He described the lawsuit as hypothetical.
He argued a district court had correctly tossed out the lawsuit because the plaintiffs lacked standing. He said the people suing had suffered no “injury.” Justices asked if he was saying they needed to break the law to sue. He said he wasn’t suggesting that.
“The only issue in front of you today is standing,” Christie said. “The standing inquiry is not whether the claim has merit. It’s whether the plaintiff is the property party to assert the claim. … There’s no reason to even get to the merits.”
Huebert said Nebraska risked holding the plaintiffs to too high a standard to sue. He said they should be allowed to make their case, because the city took away their choice to exercise their 2nd Amendment rights and feel safe.
“In the federal courts and in other state courts, plaintiffs do not have to violate a law that carries criminal penalties,” Huebert said. “To challenge that law in court, they don’t have to subject themselves to arrest, prosecution or other enforcement actions.”
Many of the justices’ questions sidestepped the constitutional issue of whether the City of Lincoln overstepped by banning weapons in city parks and some public spaces. Instead, they focused on the narrower legal issue of whether the lower court had mistakenly decided that the gun owners lacked standing to sue.
The Nebraska Supreme Court does not immediately decide such cases. It will issue a written order once the court decides.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley said Thursday that a woman’s conviction for stealing $1.8 million from the state should send a message.
“Don’t do that,” Jackley said during a press conference after the announcement of the verdict.
At the end of a three-day trial and an hour of deliberation, a Hughes County jury found 68-year-old Lonna Carroll guilty on two felony counts of grand theft. She’ll be sentenced later.
Jackley said he also hopes the case sends a message to potential whistleblowers.
“That they can come forth to us, that we will take action on it, and we will do everything that we can to protect those employees that are doing the right thing,” he said. 
Carroll’s conviction is the highest-profile outcome in a recent wave of white-collar prosecutions in South Dakota state government, which have also spurred reforms and increased scrutiny on departmental financial controls.
During the trial, Jackley’s prosecution team laid out a paper trail illustrating Carroll’s scheme, played her recorded confession, and showed a document she signed saying she committed the crimes.  
Carroll formerly worked as an administrative assistant for Child Protection Services in the Department of Social Services. Her crimes were discovered by a department employee after Carroll had retired and moved to Algona, Iowa.

Carroll was found guilty of submitting fraudulent financial requests on behalf of children no longer in the state’s care, depositing the funds into accounts opened under their names, and withdrawing the money in cash for herself. Prosecutors said she did that 215 times between 2010 and 2023, stealing a total of $1,777,665.73. 
She faces up to 25 years in prison and a $50,000 fine for one count of aggravated grand theft, and 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine for the other count.
Defense makes its case
Carroll’s defense attorney, Timothy Whalen, argued the state bore responsibility due to lax oversight. He also contended that the statute of limitations should have prevented the prosecution. 
Whalen had Logan Aukes, who manages Williams & Company CPAs in Sioux Falls, testify as an expert auditor. He said the compartmentalized nature of responsibilities within the state department created an environment where employees could look around and say, “I’m not really being looked at in anything I do.” 
Prior testimony explained that Child Protection Services has three tiers of approval for payment requests, and Carroll was authorized for all three levels.
Whalen said that because “my client was authorized,” the charges don’t fit the behavior.
Jackley called that absurd. He said there is no question the department left the door open for Carroll. But he said that leaving a door unlocked does not give someone the right to go through it. 
Afterward, when asked why the case went to trial, Whalen said Carroll exercised her constitutional right after plea discussions failed to result in a resolution.
Asked whether an agreement was ever close, Whalen responded that there were plea offers back and forth, “for pleading to one count, two counts, different recommendations of sentence.”
“My client made the decision,” Whalen said.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The University of Louisiana at Monroe will ask the University of Louisiana System Board of Supervisors for permission to furlough staff to head off an approximately $5 million to $6 million budget shortfall that must be addressed by June 30. 
The earliest the UL Board can approve the plan is April 24, so the furloughs would start no sooner than early May, acting ULM  President Nick Bruno said in an interview with the Illuminator. Because they would begin so late in the academic and fiscal year, the furlough schedule may have to be aggressive to achieve the savings necessary by June 30, the last day of the current state fiscal year. 
“We’re going to work hard to minimize the impact on [employees],” Bruno said. “I will make sure [my furlough] is heavier than anyone else’s.” 
Faculty and staff layoffs are not currently being considered, Bruno said. The university is also planning to restructure, although Bruno said no specifics have yet been ironed out. 
Bruno, 73, previously served as ULM president from 2010-20 before he retired. The UL Board tapped him to lead the campus on an interim basis while they conduct a search for a permanent replacement for Ron Berry, who was removed ahead of his planned resignation in May.
UL System Board Chairman Mark Romero said Bruno was needed to deal with the university’s budget shortfall. Berry is on administrative leave, though he is expected to return to his faculty position in the fall. 
The university instituted a hiring freeze Monday, Bruno’s first day as acting president. It is also looking at other cost-saving measures, including a temporary pause on travel and shutting air conditioning off at night. 
Gov. Jeff Landry announced a statewide hiring freeze for the executive branch Wednesday, which includes higher education. The UL Board will have to seek permission from Landry’s budget chief, Commissioner of Administration Taylor Barras, to fill any position, including the ULM presidency. 
Bruno said he would not allow the university to end the year in the red and that he does not intend to seek a handout from the system office. 
ULM is not alone in its fiscal crisis. The University of New Orleans faces a much larger budget deficit and has been working since last fall to address the shortfall. The Board of Regents last week recommended moving UNO back to the LSU system to address the crisis.

Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, speaks on the Senate floor during debate on a property tax bill on April 3, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate unanimously passed a property tax bill Thursday, but adopted major amendments that could set up a conference committee showdown between the House and Senate.
Amendments to House Bill 1176 reduce the maximum primary residence credit from the $1,450 approved by the House to $1,250. Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who backs the original bill, had proposed a credit of up to $1,550 for homeowners.
The Senate also adopted what Senate Majority Leader David Hogue called a “skin-in-the-game” amendment that would limit the credit to 75% of the property owner’s total tax liability. Homeowners would get a minimum tax credit of $500, the same level approved by lawmakers in 2023.
Committee advances North Dakota property tax bill but reduces level of tax credit

Another amendment includes language urging lawmakers in the 2027 session to consider reducing property taxes for other property types, such as agricultural and commercial.
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said she worries about excluding agricultural property from the tax credit when about 40% of the Legislature represents rural areas. She added rural areas depend more on property taxes than urban areas and excluding agricultural land from the bill puts a greater burden on those taxpayers.
The Senate version of the bill would provide an estimated $478 million in tax relief for citizens for 2025-27, Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said he is still advocating for the House version of the bill, but he’s shifting his focus to the conference committee.
“I think if the original version was on the floor of the Senate it would pass,” Armstrong said. “I think there is plenty of room to get it back to where it was.”
The bill will now be sent back to the House for approval of the amendments. If the House does not concur with the Senate’s changes, a conference committee made up of three members from each chamber will be appointed to iron out the differences.
Hogue, R-Minot, who advocated for the amendments, said it’s possible the conference committee won’t be able to agree on how to reconcile the bill. 
He added the Senate Finance and Taxation Committee still has two property tax bills, House Bill 1575 and House Bill 1168, under consideration. Both of those bills would reduce taxes for other  property types, while House Bill 1176 only affects primary residences.
Senate lawmakers weigh questions of fairness in North Dakota property tax debate

“There may be no compromise and so we’ll go onto some other form of tax relief for North Dakotans,” Hogue said. “The Senate consensus is that what we passed today reflects the will of the Senate.”
Armstrong said the Senate may have property tax measures in reserve, but they still need to clear both chambers.
Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, primary sponsor of the bill, said the House supports the version of the bill with a $1,450 primary residence credit. 
“This is the No. 1 issue coming into this session and people have spoken loud and clear, and that’s what’s so disappointing about these amendments being kept on and reducing the benefits,” Nathe said. “I don’t understand why they did what they did.”
Sen. Mark Weber, R-Casselton, chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation Committee, said if the bill gets to a conference committee, there will be some haggling over the primary residence credit that could go on for multiple days.
He added the two property tax bills in his committee could be used to provide technical corrections for House Bill 1176 depending on what happens during the conference committee.
“We’ve come a long ways and now we’ll begin the third period,” Weber said. “I think the governor obviously wanted the bill to come out as is so he could quickly sign it and get it out there, which is a noble thing. But there was a little difference in thinking on some of this and that’s why we have the Senate and the House.”

Free.,Judge to temporarily block Trump administration from yanking $11B in health funds from states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-temporarily-block-trump-administration-yanking-11b-health-funds-states,,"A federal judge in Rhode Island will grant a request from Democratic state officials to temporarily prevent President Donald Trump’s administration from cutting state health grants, the judge said at a Thursday afternoon hearing.U.S. District Court Judge Mary McElroy said the 24 Democratic attorneys general and governors were likely to prevail on the merits of their case seeking to restore funding that the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services abruptly rescinded late last month.““I’m going to grant the temporary restraining order. The balance of the equities are to maintaining the funding as it is,” McElroy said after brief arguments from attorneys representing a consortium of state governments and HHS. “The harm to the plaintiff states and the plaintiff agencies if we cease that … is clearly irreparable.”HHS, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., revoked $11 billion in grant funding to states beginning on March 24, the states wrote in a Tuesday filing requesting the court block the move.McElroy indicated at least part of her decision was based on the broadness of the Trump administration’s argument.The administration was hampered from fighting the case after receiving the states’ motion for a temporary restraining order and “4,000 pages of exhibits” mere days ago, Leslie Kane, who represented HHS, said.“Given the time limitation … it really significantly limits any substantive argument I can make at this time,” Kane said. She still offered a general objection to the “extraordinary emergency relief” she said the states were seeking.But McElroy, whom Trump appointed during his first presidency, ruled that the “voluminous” record provided by the states weighed in favor of granting the order.“Given that the government really hasn't had time to make any kind of objection except a broad objection, I don't see how I can deny the temporary restraining order on the record that's before the court, which, again: quite voluminous,” McElroy said.States scramblingThe rescissions of grant funding in late March from COVID-19-era laws surprised state health departments and led to rapid layoffs and pauses in contract work while states scrambled to understand what other cuts they would need to make.Sarah Rice, an assistant attorney general in Rhode Island who argued for the Democratic states, listed several effects already or soon to be felt by the states.In Minnesota, 170 employees had already been laid off, with hundreds more at risk of job loss. Rhode Island employees with extensive training on vaccine storage might be laid off. Subcontractors in Wisconsin were told to pause their work, and Washington state may be unable to move substance abuse and mental health patients from a “high-acuity” treatment setting to community treatment, Rice said.“These are just exemplars from the very many declarations that the state employees put together,” she said.States had no advance warning their funding would be pulled, and were especially shocked by the reversal of funding because HHS had told them how to continue to use COVID-19 funding, Rice said.“This was quite a surprising turn because HHS had prior issued guidance that instructed the states how to modify these programs to comply with the appropriations statutes after the public health emergency related to COVID-19 had ended,” Rice said.The department had even granted states extensions for various grants as late as June 2027, Rice added.The attorneys general of Colorado, Rhode Island, California, Minnesota, Washington, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin and Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania brought the case.",,,,2025-04-03 19:04:51.154754

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)Humanities Montana received notice Wednesday from the National Endowment for the Humanities that its $1 million general operating grant was “terminated immediately,” according to executive director Jill Baker.
The federal money represents the bulk of the budget for Humanities Montana, which supports arts and civics programs across the state.
“Today is not a great day,” Baker said Thursday morning.
Established in 1972, Humanities Montana is a nonprofit affiliate of the NEH, “created in order to better infuse the humanities into public life.”
Baker said the $1 million pays for grants that support cultural institutions in Montana and the Humanities Montana staff, who support the grants and programs.
It pays for public humanities programming, such as a program that funds visits to schools and communities by the poet laureate or workshops by other artists, historians and philosophers.


Humanities Montana dollars
In 2023, Humanities Montana funding was spent as follows:
Programs: $371,045
Grants: $184,631
Administration: $299,892
Fundraising and outreach: $47,039
In 2023, it received $817,342 from the NEH; $160,000 from other grant revenue; $20,188 from royalties and income; and $13,699 from individuals.

Poet Laureate Chris La Tray, a Métis storyteller, said he has put roughly 40,000 miles on his truck in the last 10 months in Montana talking to people about the arts, and it connects people across cultures, ages and political leanings.
“It’s something that binds us all and is critical to our society, in Montana and beyond,” La Tray said.
A letter from National Endowment for the Humanities Acting Chairman Michael McDonald to Baker said the grant “no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities” and is subject to termination “due to several reasonable causes.”
“NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” said the letter, provided to the Daily Montanan by Baker.
It cited an executive order by President Donald Trump called “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy” and said termination is necessary to “safeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal priorities.”
“The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority for the administration, and due to exceptional circumstances, adherence to the traditional notification process is not possible,” the letter said.
The letter is dated April 2, 2025, and said the grant was terminated “in its entirety” effective April 2, 2025.
The Trump administration and billionaire Elon Musk, through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have been making deep cuts to the federal government.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the extent of the cuts at the National Endowment for the Humanities.
However, citing a senior official at the NEH, National Public Radio said the decreases are estimated to be in the millions, and no awards will be made in 2025.
Humanities Montana said its programs operate in museums, libraries, community centers, parks and educational institutions, including homeschool settings.
“It’s an essential part of building vibrant communities,” Baker said in a statement.
Michelle Nowling, executive director of the Ravalli County Museum and Historical Society, said the funds are a way that communities keep their own histories alive, and the cuts will hurt institutions in small towns.
“I think it’s a tragedy,” Nowling said.
In 2024, the museum received a $7,000 grant to support a documentary, “Bitterroot at War: The Vietnam Era.”
Nowling said the film was timed to screen this year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, and it features five Vietnam veterans from the Bitterroot.
“Most of them, all but one, had never spoken publicly about it before,” Nowling said.
An estimated 70 people attended the first screening, an emotional event, she said, and the museum honored all veterans who attended.
With a template in hand for such a documentary, Nowling had hoped to embark on a similar project with Bitterroot veterans of the Korean War.
However, she said small institutions don’t have many places to turn to for projects that educate and build community, and now, she isn’t sure if that idea can get off the ground.
“If we don’t have the funds to pay the people with the skills to tell our stories, how will future generations know who we were?” Nowling said.
Baker said Humanities Montana has received federal dollars for 50 years, including some increases for inflation, and the funding has been consistent.
Last year, the funding reached all 56 counties, according to Humanities Montana. The organization said the impact is “particularly significant in rural areas,” where other sources are limited.
“Investing in our communities has always been a point of pride for Montanans, and most of us have benefitted from a grant from Humanities Montana,” Baker said in a statement.
On its website, Humanities Montana shares quotes from rural educators, who said bringing quality speakers to schools is expensive, and the program is meaningful.
Money covers a stipend and travel costs, and an administrator from Baker said it’s important, “particularly for our very rural school district.”
“It can be incredibly costly and difficult to bring quality speakers to Baker, so we are very grateful that a program like this can help to make it possible,” the principal said in a quote on the Humanities Montana website.
La Tray, also a book author, said he travels the state in various capacities, including in ways supported by Humanities Montana, and he will continue to look for ways to talk with rural audiences.
He said he doesn’t imagine Trump will be able to hold onto power beyond this term, but he also said this administration isn’t the only one that hasn’t cared enough about the arts to ensure it’s an integral part of society.
In other words, La Tray said people haven’t chosen leaders, Democrat or Republican, who made funding for the humanities reliable, money that couldn’t just be “yanked” away.
“We need to change that. That begins with us at the ground level, at the grassroots level,” said La Tray, an enrolled member of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians.
A list of Humanities Montana grants for the 2024 fiscal year includes $500 awards to rural book clubs, Big Sky Reads, and $1,000 to $10,000 awarded for films and community projects.
Projects include support for a Cree language revitalization program; an oral history of the Jewish community in Montana; and a program about “unsung hero” York, William Clark’s slave.
Baker said Humanities Montana had received the federal three-year grant of $1 million a year. The grant was set to conclude at the end of September 2025, and the termination notice ends the grant five months early.
She said continuing resolutions in Congress might affect some funding. A lot of the implications of the cut are still unclear, but she believes it would be DOGE’s intent not to reopen humanities grants.
“We’re learning this as we go,” Baker said.
Baker also said she hopes Montanans will reach out to the Congressional delegation and their friends.
She asked them to share the reasons the humanities are significant to them or to find “creative ways to safeguard this funding and the programs and individuals it supports.”
Baker said the organization has implemented a contingency plan and has “a limited privately donated reserve fund to assist with essential expenses for now.” She said staff have not been terminated but furloughs may be necessary “in the near future.”

Instead, he was on the defensive over his office's investigations and losses. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State legislators rebuked Attorney General Matt Platkin Thursday for several recent high-profile court losses and suggested New Jersey needs an inspector general to oversee his office’s work during a legislative hearing in Trenton Thursday.
Platkin, appearing before the Senate’s budget committee to discuss his $1.6 billion budget request for the next fiscal year, pushed back on the attacks that peppered nearly three hours of testimony, prompting the committee’s chair, Sen. Paul Sarlo, to chide Platkin for being “combative” and urge all parties involved to quit talking over each other.

Some of the testiest questioning came from Sen. Doug Steinhardt (R-Warren), who interrogated Platkin over gun data in the wake of Bruen, the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision that forced states like New Jersey to remove restrictions on carry permits.
Steinhardt and Platkin sparred over whether an increase in people carrying firearms results in more violence. Platkin maintained that it does, which Steinhardt called a “false narrative.” Steinhardt noted that Platkin himself testified that the 778 people who were shot last year in New Jersey represents the smallest number of people shot here since state police began tracking shooting data in 2009.
“What you’re saying makes zero sense,” Steinhardt said. “You come in here telling us that shooting stats are down, yet 60,000 more people have carry permits than they did in the two and a half years preceding Bruen. With people running around carrying firearms like they would be, why aren’t the stats through the roof?
Platkin responded: “I’m not sure that anything I said doesn’t make sense … The statistics that I’m referencing are kept and collected by the state police. I don’t cook them up in my office.”
A 2022 study by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found gun assaults rose in states that relaxed restrictions on conceal carry permits.
The criticism of Platkin was bipartisan, with several senators bringing up recent losses by Platkin’s office of public integrity and accountability. That office led a racketeering investigation into South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross that resulted in a 13-count indictment a state judge dismissed in February. Platkin’s office has appealed that dismissal.

Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) told Platkin the Norcross case was “painful to watch.”
“That case did appear to be a very personal matter,” Burzichelli said. “I would say, if we were talking off to the side, that a number of people feel equally aggrieved at the Norcross event, top to bottom.”
He zeroed in on comments Platkin made when he appealed the Norcross dismissal, when Platkin said the dismissal, if allowed to stand, would send a message that the “most wealthy and well-connected few” live under a diferent criminal justice system than everyone else. Those comments, as well as the loss itself, created “a distraction of confusion that doesn’t reflect well on you,” Burzichelli said.
But Platkin defended the public integrity and accountability office’s record, saying it’s had “well over 100 successful cases and … less than a handful” of losses. The media, he complained, typically ignore the wins and focus on the losses.
On his lament about two systems of criminal justice, Platkin said: “Whatever case it is, I’m the attorney general of the state. I want people to believe in the criminal justice system.”
Both Steinhardt and Burzichelli also questioned whether the Attorney General’s Office should continue overseeing state police or should be subjected to oversight itself, suggesting Platkin has a vendetta against the state police that is illustrated by recent investigations by his office that uncovered widespread problems in the agency.
Platkin rejected both suggestions. Keeping the state police under the state attorney general’s supervision would ensure coordination and oversight, he said. Supervision by an inspector general is unnecessary, he added.
“We already have robust procedures to ensure that any allegation of misconduct is taken seriously, is addressed independently within our office, and is handled appropriately,” he said.
Republican legislators in February called for Platkin’s ouster, partly over his lawsuits targeting the Trump administration.

Jessica McGowan/Getty Images (2018 file photo)Georgia senators will get one last chance this year to pass a divisive bill that spells out legislative committee investigative powers to subpoena witnesses and require them to turn over evidence. 
The Senate could take up the latest version of Senate Bill 255, which cleared the House Wednesday by a 91-67 vote following a debate over whether legislative power to conduct probes could be wielded as partisan political attacks against public officials and advocacy groups.
Rep. Rob Leverett, an Elberton Republican, said Wednesday that the measure does not expand current legislative powers but instead provides more explanation into how committees are able to legally exercise their subpoena powers in a transparent manner.
The bill was filed while Athens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert chaired a Senate special investigative committee that became embroiled in a legal battle over the right to issue subpoenas compelling Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to testify and turn over a trove of documents related to the election interference case she brought against President Donald Trump and 18 codefendants. 
The Senate special committee was convened last year after Willis came under fire last year when she admitted to a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she hired to lead the  sweeping felony election interference case following former President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory.

House Minority Whip Sam Park argued Wednesday that SB 255 could be used by lawmakers to continue  efforts like the Senate committee’s investigation of Willis despite a state appellate court recently disqualifying the Fulton district attorney from the case over prosecutorial misconduct accusations. Willis has said her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade did not overlap with the time she retained him to press the case against Trump and his allies.
Park, a Lawrenceville Democrat, said future legislative committees could begin using its powers to “subpoena election workers, nonprofit leaders, poll observers while demanding private emails and phone records from individuals who never committed a crime but now they’re forced to testify under oath and spend thousands on legal defense.” 
Park said GOP legislators with majority control of a chamber could also target advocacy groups they oppose on other hot button issues like women’s reproductive rights.
Cowsert’s Senate Special Committee on Investigations is also expected to begin a probe of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams’ ties to a voter registration nonprofit recently slapped with one of the largest campaign ethics fines ever levied by the state.
Earlier this session the Senate advanced Cowsert’s Senate Resolution 292, which would allow the committee to investigate the Abrams-founded New Georgia Project following a Jan. 15 settlement in a 2019 case alleging illegal campaign contributions to Abrams’ 2018 gubernatorial campaign.

In March, Cowsert said the committee’s purpose is not to target prominent figures in the Democratic Party, but is about holding candidates running for public office and nonprofits accountable for potentially using “dark money” to make illegal campaign contributions. 
“We’re wanting to make sure we restore the faith in our in the public that you don’t have to worry in the future that funds donated to nonprofit advocacy tax-free organizations aren’t used illegally to collaborate support campaigns on either side of the partisan divide,” Cowsert said late last month.

(Sean McCallister | Charleston Gazette-Mail photo)On the heels of a federal office in Morgantown firing dozens of employees, union representatives of West Virginia’s federal workforce call on the state’s elected leaders to speak out against what they say are “reckless cuts.” 
“We need congress to ask our president to stop the reckless cuts and take a measured approach to reforming government and balancing the budget such as was done in the 1990s,” said Dan Doyle, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1995. “The current actions are chaotic, disruptive, counterproductive and frankly wasteful.” 
Doyle’s comments came during a press conference Thursday outside the House of Delegates chamber at the West Virginia State Capitol. Since January, hundreds of thousands of federal employees have lost their jobs as President Donald Trump and Elon Musk carry out their plan to downsize the government through the Department of Government Efficiency. 
About 23,000 employees work at 20 federal facilities in West Virginia and 33,000 federal workers live in the state, Doyle said. The total number of West Virginia federal workers who have been laid off is difficult to say, because many are under orders not to talk about it. Doyle said West Virginians will also be affected by potential cuts to federal programs and services like Social Security and the Mine Health and Safety Administration. 
“Instead of letting cuts be made by powerful interests to enrich the hands of a few, we came here today to ask our elected officials in Charleston and our citizens in our state, speak up together with us for the good of the families, for working people and for West Virginia,” Doyle said.  
About 400 workers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown have lost their jobs, Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of AFGE Local 3040 said. Tinney-Zara had initially said the number was around 200. The new estimate includes 185 bargaining unit employees, nonbargaining unit employees, management, contractors and others, she said. 
“We have millions of dollars of research that is just sitting there, I guess, to be destroyed,” she said Thursday. Tinney-Zara and other workers there are terminated as of June 7. At this point, the office is expected to close completely, she said. 
Altogether, a restructuring of the federal Health and Human Services will include cutting the workforce by 10,000, federal officials have said.
“I was [at NIOSH] 32 years, and people do not get into public health unless they care,” she said. “It’s devastating. People are going to die.”
The Trump administration has said it plans to cut 80,000 employees from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Bryan Hunt, president of AFGE Local 2384, said that any cuts to staffing at the state’s four Veterans Affairs Medical Centers will have a negative impact on the veterans seeking care and the communities where employees live. 
“I just ask that our representatives speak that, how concerning that is,” he said. “And know that our veterans in West Virginia are important and the VA is important. The employees are important.” 
Democrats in the state Legislature also called on Republican leaders to stand up for West Virginia workers as DOGE and the Trump administration’s tariffs potentially lead to more job loss. 
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, said since January, the state’s north central region has lost about 1,000 jobs. Those include cuts at NIOSH and around 200 jobs that will leave Fairmont when the Novelis facility closes after 100 years in the community. The Legislature’s Republican supermajority have done nothing to mitigate those job losses, Williams said. 
“No one is sticking up for West Virginians,” he said. “No one that they elected is sticking up for them. We can talk about it until we’re blue in the face every single day, but until Republicans start working for the people that elected them and stop trying to win MAGA member of the month, none of this is going to change.” 
Asked about recent job cuts for West Virginia workers during a press conference Thursday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said the state should do everything it can to drive job development and pointed to some initiatives the Legislature is considering, including universal licensing reciprocity, a bill to speed up permitting processes for businesses looking to locate in the state, and legislation meant to incentivize the creation of microgrids and data centers in the state.  
“No one wants to lose a job and certainly my heart goes out to everyone. We’re going to work and fight so that there’s so many jobs in West Virginia that we’re going to really succeed as a state,” Morrisey said. “I know that there have been a number of stories [about job losses] recently, but I’m optimistic the long-term arc, if we do what we need to do here, is going to work out well for the people of our state.”

A review by the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office found 15 additional people who may have voted in the 2024 general election despite not being U.S. citizens—a significant increase from previous reports. The newly identified voters are scattered across Michigan, with no immediate indication of any broader coordinated effort, officials said.
The information comes as lawmakers at both the state and federal level consider requiring documentary proof of citizenship before voters are able to register.
The results of the review, first reported by The Detroit News, are in addition to the single reported instance of noncitizen voting: Haoxiang Gao, a University of Michigan student who allegedly cast a vote in Ann Arbor last year despite not being a U.S. citizen. Gao faces felony charges for the accused crime and is expected in court later this month.
Though the 15 potential noncitizen voters represent a tiny fraction of the more than 5.7 million ballots cast in the 2024 general election, Michigan Republicans pointed to the findings as justification for their recent proposed constitutional amendment, which would require new voters to prove their citizenship at the time they register. The amendment leaves it to future Legislatures to define what qualifies as valid proof. Voters already registered could also be forced to prove their citizenship as the proposal requires the state to run continual citizenship checks on the voting rolls.
“First it was 1, now it’s 15,” Rep. Bryan Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford and the primary author of the proposal, said in a social media post shortly after news broke. “The truth is, we have no idea how many. And now that everyone knows the loophole exists, how many more if we don’t close it!”
Angela Benander, spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office, said the state began cross-checking Michigan driver’s license records with the Qualified Voter File — the state’s official list of more than 8.1 million registered voters — late last year. Noncitizens can legally obtain Michigan driver’s licenses and state IDs, so the comparison focused on individuals listed as noncitizens in licensing records who also voted in the general election.
Officials noted that newly naturalized citizens don’t always immediately update the state, instead opting to show their new citizenship when they next renew their license.
Of 15 new potential cases, 13 were referred to Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office for investigation. One of the 15 people has died since voting. The final person is being investigated for other potentially fraudulent voter activity, SOS spokesperson Angela Benander told Votebeat.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, in an emailed statement to Votebeat, said that noncitizen voting was a “serious issue” but one that required “a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.”
“Our careful review confirms what we already knew – that this illegal activity is very rare. While we take all violations of election law very seriously, this tiny fraction of potential cases in Michigan and at the national level do not justify recent efforts to pass laws we know would block tens of thousands of Michigan citizens from voting in future elections,” said Benson, a Democrat who is running for governor. “Instead of those failed policies, we will continue to work with lawmakers on reasonable, data-driven efforts to improve security while ensuring that eligible citizens can always make their voice heard.”
Nessel’s office confirmed it was reviewing the cases, saying it would announce charges if they were filed.
“Attorney General Nessel is, of course, disappointed to learn any number of non-citizens were able to cast ballots in our recent elections, and Michiganders should be assured that those criminally responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Nessel spokesperson Danny Wimmer said.
Benander said Michigan’s findings are consistent with other states. In Georgia, for instance, officials last year found that about 20 noncitizens on the state’s voter rolls of more than 8.2 million registered voters. Benander said the state will do similar analyses in the future to ensure only citizens are voting in the state’s elections.
Benson has acknowledged noncitizen voting as a legitimate concern, but argues that requiring broad documentary proof would not solve the issue. Benson said in February that she would instead work with Democrats in the legislature to close loopholes that make noncitizen voting possible, although no such legislation has been introduced yet.
The proposed constitutional amendment, known as House Joint Resolution B, passed out of the House Election Integrity Committee last month and is now before the full Michigan House, where it has the support of a Republican majority. But even if it passes the House, it faces slim odds in the Democrat-controlled Senate.
A parallel citizen-led effort may move the proposal forward instead. “Prove It, Michigan,” the group backing a ballot initiative to require proof-of-citizenship, is scheduled to appear before the Board of State Canvassers as soon as this month to confirm their proposed ballot language. If approved, they could immediately begin collecting the more than 446,000 signatures required to be on the ballot.

Tony Evers and the Department of Public Instruction [&#8230;]","The seven members of the Wisconsin Supreme Court hear oral arguments in 2023. (Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday in a case related to a statewide literacy program that considers Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto power and lawmakers’ handling of emergency funds.
The case comes as the result of the last state budget and efforts by state lawmakers, Gov. Tony Evers and the Department of Public Instruction to overhaul literacy programs in Wisconsin. 
During the 2023-25 budget cycle, lawmakers placed $50 million aside in an emergency fund controlled by the Joint Finance Committee that was meant to go towards funding new literacy programs. Lawmakers also passed AB 321 — now 2023 Wisconsin Act 20 — to establish the policy portions of the initiative, which included creating a new office in the Department of Public Instruction and instructing the agency to hire literacy coaches and create a grant program. 
Lawmakers subsequently passed SB 971, now 2023 Wisconsin Act 100, to create a mechanism for DPI to spend the money when the funds were transferred. A partial veto by Gov. Tony Evers caused lawmakers to sue, saying it wasn’t an appropriations bill therefore not subject to a partial veto.  Evers argued that the law included an appropriation and further asserted that DPI has been urging lawmakers to release the funds, which will lapse back into the state’s $4 billion budget surplus if not used before June 30.
Before the Supreme Court heard the case, a Dane County judge had ruled Evers’ veto proper, but said there wasn’t a case for the release of the funds. Both parties appealed to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed to take the appeal directly
Assistant Attorney General Charlotte Gibson, the Department of Justice lawyer for DPI and Evers, argued that lawmakers don’t have the power to withhold the money and the court should order the release of the money to DPI. 
The issues at hand, Gibson said, “reflect an interlocking strategy to control how the executive branch spends funds and to limit the governor’s partial veto power. It involves dissecting appropriations into multiple bills and crediting funds set aside for executive agency programs to [the Joint Finance Committee] to control their destination and use. Those efforts are illegal, and they misread the governor’s veto authority.” 
Gibson said that the intention of the law, and the money being placed in the emergency fund, was to give money to specific agencies for specific purposes. A brief notes that “over the past few decades, the Legislature has increasingly used that appropriation not for emergencies, but rather to fund anticipated expenses through a legislative committee that purports to retain veto power over how the executive branch spends appropriated money.” 
Gibson said that the purpose of the emergency fund statute was not to serve as “a holding pen for lots of money that the Legislature wanted to give [the committee] power over,” but lawmakers are using it “to say, actually, we can spend it on whatever purpose…” 
“We think to correct the constitutional violation here, this agency can order those funds to be released,” Gibson said. 
Justices questioned Gibson on why the funds would need to be released to DPI if there was never an appropriation.
“The reality is the money’s sitting in a fund right now, and it hasn’t done anything with it,” Justice Rebecca Dallet said. “For all, we know they are going to use it for an emergency and not give it to anybody for anything else … that just hasn’t happened yet.”
Gibson replied that DPI has asked for the money and lawmakers haven’t given it to the agency. 
“But, I’m saying, [JFC] hasn’t appropriated it anywhere,” Dallet said. “Is DPI having an emergency where you think this is emergency money that you should get…?” 
“No, we think it’s unconstitutional for DPI not to get the money.” Gibson said. 
“Even if you were right, that the statutory structure here is constitutionally problematic, I still don’t see how you win and get the money, because that is not what the law says,” Justice Brian Hagedorn said. “There’s no provision of law that actually gives the money to DPI or appropriates the money to DPI.”
Gibson noted that the co-chairs of the committee Sen. Howard Marklein and Rep. Mark Born have said the money is earmarked for the purpose of the literacy programs. 
“What we’re struggling with is that we understand that there are hints and clues, earmarks — so different from an appropriation — and the way I’m looking at it, it could probably be parked in that fund indefinitely and that’s where I’m struggling with what’s the legal nexus,” said Justice Janet Protasiewicz. 
Ryan Walsh, the attorney representing the Legislature, argued Evers’ veto was inappropriate because the bill was not an appropriation bill, and that the remedy should be that the bill is law as passed by the Legislature, without Evers’ veto. 
“You can’t have an appropriation bill that makes no appropriation. It just doesn’t make sense,” Walsh said. However, he also said that if he is wrong then it means the law was improperly enacted because lawmakers passed it by voice vote, not roll call as is required of appropriations bills. 
Walsh said that under his argument the money would stay in JFC and go back to the treasury at the end of the biennium. 
“It doesn’t go to DPI,” Walsh said. “There is no obligation for [JFC] to disperse this money.” 
Justice Jill Karofsky said that she didn’t disagree about the discretion of the committee, but asked about the potential for lawmakers to abuse the discretion. 
“There aren’t really any guardrails here,” Karofsky said. 
Walsh said abuse “just doesn’t happen.” 
“What would stop the Legislature from emptying every last dollar of the Wisconsin treasury into a [JFC] emergency account?” Karofsky asked further. 
Walsh said many things could prevent that from happening, including the governor refusing to sign a budget that does so. 
Walsh also said the emergency account is a small portion of the state budget. He said that in the last 10 years the percentage of the budget that has gone to the supplemental account has ranged from 0.06% in the 2017-19 budget to 0.33% in the 2021-23 budget.
Justice Ann Walsh Bradley said she thought “part of why we are here [is] that some want us to take a look at this structure — allowing JFC to have this discretion — and that to not address it would be a rather lame opinion.”
Walsh said that he didn’t think the Court needed to reach the constitutional question. 
“I don’t think anybody is insisting that you decide whether [Wisconsin should retain the] supplemental funding structure, which has been in place a long time, and by the way, the governor and the Legislature are assuming it’s still in place,” Walsh said. “We have a new budget pending… There are lots of reasons to be cautious here.”

Child care expenses are a concern that hits home for John Jackson, head of financial planning and analysis for BlackRock in Atlanta and a member of the board of directors for Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students.  
“As a dad of three daughters, I know how challenging it can be to find reliable, high-quality child care,” Jackson said. “I’ve had mornings where our backup child care is unavailable, and it’s instant chaos in terms of my wife and I trying to figure out who’s going to miss work, what schedule and meetings will be changed and how we are going to close those gaps.”
Several nonprofits like GEEARS and Voices for Georgia’s Children are advocating for financial support for families, especially those with young children. In the COVID era, many parents pulled their children out of child care facilities while teachers also left their workplaces due to stay-at-home orders. This allowed providers to lower their prices significantly, but as parents have returned to work and new families search for a place to take care of their children, providers have struggled to maintain enough openings at an affordable price.  
“The child care system that we have now really doesn’t work for families who need care, or for the teachers who teach and care for the kids who are in care,” said Ife Finch Floyd, director of economic justice for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. “Often people call that a market failure, where we can’t always meet the needs of the demand.” 
Child care providers face a hard time attracting new employees and retaining current workers while keeping prices affordable for families. Since other employers can offer more competitive wages, many workers may opt for a career outside of the child care industry. Many providers have raised prices to cover their expenses and increase workers’ wages.   
A bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Brian Strickland from McDonough aims to ease the pressures of the increasingly expensive cost of raising a family for Georgians.

Strickland proposes to allow taxpayers to claim 50% of a portion of their child care expenses on their state taxes, up from 30%. His bill would also create a new $250 credit per child six years of age or younger. It also aims to offer a $1,000 tax credit for child care facilities for each employee whose child is six years of age or younger and is enrolled in the facility.
Strickland’s bill has now been tacked onto House Bill 136, legislation designed to increase financial support for foster care providers. Last year, Strickland was involved in a Senate study committee that explored child care costs in Georgia, where he says he learned more about how child care access affects not only families but businesses too. His work on this bill comes from a personal place – his own family life. 
“Having two young children myself, a lot of people that I come in contact with have kids the same age as my kids and we’re are all struggling with the same thing,” Strickland said. “We’re all trying to figure out ‘can we make enough money working to cover child care costs?’ It’s something that’s affecting people all around our state.” 
 The bill has received bipartisan support throughout the session. Advocates and legislators emphasize the economic benefits of strong support for early education. A flyer passed out by GEEARS at a recent press conference read, “Every $1 invested in high-quality early learning yields as much as $13 in savings.” 
“This is a piece that is designed to help the taxpayer,” Strickland said. “This is keeping more of the money that you’d otherwise be paying the government.” 
Since the credits offered by Strickland’s bill are non-refundable and cannot exceed the taxpayer’s tax liability, they would cost the state tax revenue. State estimates of the original bill’s cost calculated the hit to the state budget to be about $179 million in the first year. Floyd said that the cost is likely higher than this number now, as the federal match provision increased the the state credit from 40% to 50%. 
“We are supportive of tax policy that supports families with low to moderate/middle income,” said Floyd. “GBPI has long supported tax credits for the families of everyday Georgians and individuals to make sure that they can afford their basic needs and help plan for their futures.” 
While there is bipartisan consensus on the reality of rising child care costs, there are differing views on the best ways to offer relief.
  Rep. Lisa Campbell Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Kennesaw Democratic state Rep. Lisa Campbell proposes the “Georgia’s Children First” trust fund in House Resolution 396. Her bill would take a portion of Georgia’s budget surplus to support the Child and Parent Services Program, allocate money for child care providers and help purchase supplies that young children need, like diapers.  
“The annual rate of child care in Georgia right now is about $11,000 per child per year,” Campbell said. “And that’s in many cases more expensive than a college degree.” 
Creating a new trust fund in Georgia requires a constitutional amendment. Although her proposal did not receive a committee hearing before the Crossover Day deadline in early March, Campbell hopes to continue supporting this bill next year when bills filed this year that don’t pass in 2025 can have a second chance. She said Strickland’s tax credit is a “great thing to do.” 
She also recognizes the role that gender plays in the fight to support families. 
“When women exit the workforce to care for children and come back, it’s often very difficult to catch up in terms of the types of roles and responsibilities that they are offered,” she said. “It’s very rare that a woman will catch up to her peers who did not leave the workforce.”  
The proposed tax credit was unanimously approved by the Senate in late March. Strickland frames this bill as a “step” towards increasing support for Georgia’s working families. Inside and outside of the Capitol, supporters of legislation like this are advocating for Georgia’s young children to be prioritized in various ways. 
“We at Voices are big advocates for dollars and support for quality afterschool and summer learning programming as well,” said Polly McKinney, advocacy director for Voices for Georgia’s Children. “We know that school aged children deserve developmentally appropriate, safe, educational and fun places to grow into the happy, healthy and wise adults who will carry the rest of us into the future.”
The House approved Strickland’s proposal Wednesday but made a tweak to an unrelated part of the bill, so it still needs another vote in the Senate to make it to the governor’s desk and turn into law.

,DC,2025-04-03 21:47:56+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Economists blast calculations for 'bombshell' Trump tariffs as faulty while stocks plunge,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/economists-blast-calculations-bombshell-trump-tariffs-faulty-while-stocks-plunge,,"WASHINGTON — Markets and business owners in the United States and around the world reeled Thursday following President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping and steep tariffs that are not “reciprocal” but rather punish many countries that U.S. importers heavily rely on, experts say.U.S. stocks plummeted to their lowest levels since June 2020, financial media reported at the closing bell Thursday. Business groups issued criticisms, experts predicted increases in household spending and even a conservative Republican senator pushed legislation that would increase congressional power over tariffs.Trump unveiled the tariffs Wednesday during a White House Rose Garden event billed as “Liberation Day,” where he told the crowd that trading partners and allies have “torn apart our once beautiful American dream.”His answer: Signing a “historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them. Very simple.”But economists say the new U.S. tariffs Trump revealed Wednesday — illustrated on a large display table — do not match one-for-one other countries’ levies, as Trump said during his remarks.Trump held in his hands a chart that claimed to show a list of other countries’ taxes on American imports.But it was wrong.The problem with the chartVietnam does not charge a 90% tariff on American imports, as the chart said. Rather its rate for imported U.S. goods was on average 9.4% in 2023, according to the World Trade Organization.“The actual calculation (circulated by the White House) doesn't factor in other countries’ tariffs,” said Brad Setser, senior fellow on global trade at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank focused on international affairs.In other words, Setser told States Newsroom Thursday, “It’s a tariff on big bilateral trade deficits.”And so, what does that mean? And why did the president’s chart say that the U.S. would now be charging a 46% tax on every imported good from Vietnam?Vietnam is a small country, but a competitive exporter, particularly in broadcasting equipment, microchips and computers. And the U.S. is a big customer.In 2023, the U.S. imported $118 billion in goods from Vietnam, while Vietnam imported about $9.6 billion in U.S. products that year, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a trade data project with roots at MIT.The White House claimed on the chart that Vietnam applies a 90% tariff on the U.S. — when actually that percentage is roughly the dollar amount of the U.S. trade deficit divided by the dollar amount of how much the U.S. imports from the country. So, $120B - $10B = $110B, then divide that by $120B, and you get roughly 91%.Trump said he would be “kind” and give trading partners “discounted” tariff rates by about half, and that’s how Vietnam landed at a 46% tax on its imports into the U.S.“So Vietnam got hit with a huge tariff. It is literally that simple,” Setser said.Economists and journalists almost immediately took to social media to question the glaring inaccuracy.‘Bombshell’ tariffsThe new rates are a “bombshell” on U.S. allies and trading partners, said Jack Zhang, a professor of political science who runs the Trade War Lab at the University of Kansas.Vietnam tried to head off Trump’s announcement in March by cutting levies on U.S. imports and signing “big purchase agreements,” Zhang said, but it didn’t work.Historically countries have negotiated tariffs product by product in “laborious” talks, Zhang said.“You know, ‘You reduce tariffs on your stuff, I will reduce tariffs on maybe some other stuff.’ And it nets out to be fair. This sort of lazy, back-of-the-envelope kind of calculation based on the trade deficit, it makes it really hard to negotiate in those terms,” he said.Products from the European Union will now be taxed at 20%, Japan’s new rate is 24%, and South Korea’s 25% — all significant U.S. allies and trading partners. The EU has already threatened to retaliate if the U.S. does not come to the negotiating table.Countries carrying a trade surplus with the U.S. — meaning they import more American goods than they sell back to the U.S. — did not escape the policy, as Trump imposed a universal 10% tariff on every nation.The United Kingdom, which runs a trade surplus with the U.S. and in 2023 charged an average of 3.8% on imported American products, will now see a 10% tax on its items headed to U.S. buyers. Australia, whose Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the tariffs “totally unwarranted,” faces the same situation.Trump’s informational table falsely stated that the U.K., Australia and a host of other countries — including the Heard and McDonald Islands, inhabited by penguins and seals — have been charging a 10% tax on American goods.‘Damage to their own people’Trump did not include Canada and Mexico in his announcement Wednesday.But those countries are already subject to up to 25% taxes on steel, aluminum and other imports that the administration enacted in March, after declaring emergencies over illicit fentanyl and immigrants crossing the northern and southern borders.Additionally Trump’s 25% foreign car tax launched Thursday.  The neighboring countries factor big into the automobile supply chain.“Given the prospective damage to their own people, the American administration should eventually change course, but I don't want to give false hope. The president believes that what he is doing is best for the American economy,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Thursday in remarks that streamed on C-SPAN. Carney said he and Trump have agreed to economic and security negotiations next month.The proposed tariffs will amount to an average $2,100 tax increase per American household, according to an analysis released Thursday by the center-right Tax Foundation, which advocates for lower taxes.The average levy on all imports will reach 18.8%, compared to 2.5% in 2024, according to the foundation’s modeling.Numerous trade and advocacy groups spoke out against the tariffs.The National Association of Manufacturers urged the Trump administration to “minimize tariff costs for manufacturers that are investing and expanding in the U.S.”The center-right Taxpayers Protection Alliance issued a scathing statement Thursday. “​​American consumers and taxpayers should be appalled by this executive overreach,” said its president David Williams.States Newsroom spoke to small business owners from around the country who expressed fear about the cost of day-to-day supplies. One Arizona coffee shop owner told the news outlet that he purchased a year’s supply of disposable coffee cups from China last year in anticipation of Trump igniting a trade war.Trump announced a 34% tax on Chinese imports Wednesday, and some experts say that will stack on top of the existing 20% tariffs Trump imposed during his first administration that were kept in place by former President Joe Biden.Senators want more control over tariffsA bipartisan pair of senators introduced on Thursday what they’ve titled the “American Trade Review Act of 2025,” aiming to claw back congressional power over the president’s near unilateral decision-making on U.S. tariffs.“Inflation and high costs are a threat to the stability and prosperity of American businesses of all sizes, to our farmers and to our consumers,” Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state said on the Senate floor. She and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa are co-sponsoring the legislation.“We live now in an interconnected world, a global economy, and advances in technology and transportation have brought that world closer and closer together. We have a global economy,” Cantwell continued.States Newsroom sent a list of questions to the White House regarding their informational table of tariffs presented Wednesday and an opportunity to respond to criticism.In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, “Trillions in historic investment commitments from industry leaders ranging from Apple to Hyundai to TSMC are indicative of how this administration is working with the private sector while implementing President Trump’s pro-growth, pro-worker America First agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts, and the unleashing of American energy.“These America First economic policies delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and everyone from Main Street to Wall Street is again going to thrive as President Trump secures our nation’s economic future,” the statement continued.TSMC, a Taiwanese mega semiconductor producer, received $6.6 billion in direct funding from the U.S., plus $5 billion in cheap loans, under Biden’s administration after he signed the CHIPS and Science Act, according to an analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations. The country announced an additional $100 billion investment in early March.Trump announced a 32% tariff on the island nation.",,,,2025-04-03 18:06:33.935065

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.)Here’s the real kick about how President Donald Trump’s tariffs are going to hike prices for everything: Once that happens, even if the tariffs go away, the prices are never, ever going back down again.
This will impact nearly every item you can imagine: clothing, shoes, computers, phones, tablets, gaming consoles and controllers, automobiles, wine and spirits, everyday household items, furniture, coffee, chocolate.
The White House expects the tariffs to raise $6 trillion in tax revenue. That would be the largest tax hike in U.S. history.
The businesses that pay the import taxes will pass nearly all of it on to consumers by raising prices. So the responsibility for paying for this tax hike will fall hardest all regular American families, especially those who already have fixed and limited incomes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Ohio, that’s a significant chunk of our population.
Ohio currently has the 12th highest poverty rate in the nation.
The current poverty line for a family of four is a household income of $32,150.
Ohio’s overall poverty rate is 13.4%, and the child poverty rate 17.7%.
Ohio has about 11.8 million people, including about 2.6 million children.
This means that roughly 1.5 million Ohioans are living at or below the poverty line, including about 460,000 children.
These families will suffer the most, especially in the short-run, and are anticipated to lose about 4% of their disposable income.
When your entire household is trying to survive on less than $32,000 per year, that $1,280 loss in buying power hurts a lot.
That’s more than $100 per month, money that could’ve been used on groceries, toiletries, bills, basic necessities.
Imagine what $100 a month means to our senior citizens on the fixed incomes of their retirement and Social Security.
Ohio’s median household income is $69,680. A family at that level can’t afford to lose $100 a month either. And it will probably be even more for them.
While the impact as a percentage of income hits those on the lowest end of income the hardest, the actual dollar amount goes up alongside earnings/spending.
If you split up household incomes into tenths from the bottom up, the Yale Budget Lab projects that the average annual cost to households in the 2nd, 5th, and top decile rise to $1,700; $3,000; and $8,100 respectively.
We all get to pay the price for this in one way or another.
Trump’s auto tariffs, for instance, are expected to cost more than $30 billion in higher vehicle prices and reduced car sales in the first year.
Stellantis has temporarily laid off 900 U.S. workers affected by plant pauses in Canada and Mexico due to the tariffs. The UAW has hit back, calling that unnecessary. Regardless, the chaos will push corporations to protect their profits first, considering human damage control second, and to expect anything else would be foolish.
American auto companies can expect to be hit with retaliatory tariffs, which may impact auto-manufacturing and jobs and workers in Oho.
Ohio farmers can also expect to be impacted by retaliatory tariffs.
More than 20% of farm income comes from exports. Ohio is a major exporter of soybeans and corn. Ohio soybean exports generate $5 billion to $6 billion annually, but soybean exports have sank significantly in recent years, starting with the tariffs of the first Trump administration.
A potential $110 billion economic hit: How Trump’s tariffs could mean rising costs for families

The current Trump trade war with the entire rest of the world will only sink them further. The impacts on soybean and corn will affect more than 75,000 Ohio farms statewide.
Many farmers also rely on imported goods like fertilizer. The price hikes on that will raise the cost of production, and that cost will again be passed along to Ohio and American families.
Trump is promising that a revival of manufacturing will happen, eventually, because of this trade war.
Even if that comes true, it will take years, and therefore it will take years of suffering this trade war — with no guarantee of benefit to follow, much less anything better than where we were before Trump blew up the American-led world economic order.
But don’t worry America, all that Myanmar-style garment factory work you’ve been clamoring to do is coming, baby. 
That’s the message, apparently.
But I think Ohioans should remember that during his first term, Trump made the same such promises about manufacturing revival.
One of his primary boasts way back then was that Republic Steel was going to be bringing back 1,000 jobs to Lorain, Ohio.
It never happened.
Being great again is always just around the next corner, isn’t it?
In the meantime, we all get to suffer for Donald Trump and Elon Musk so that they and their country club buddies can have more.
They’ve got massive tax cuts for the rich that add $9 trillion to the national debt to pass next.
Isn’t that fun? A $6 trillion tax hike on everyday Americans, and a $9 trillion tax giveaway to the rich.
But I don’t want you to worry. If they tank the economy, Donald Trump and Elon Musk are going to be OK, even if your 401k isn’t.
When the economy tanked during the pandemic, workers lost $3.7 trillion worth of wealth while billionaires gained $3.9 trillion.
And even if they do needlessly tank the economy, we can all rest easy knowing that they shredded the social safety net before they did.

Byron Donalds was in Tallahassee Thursday, where he met with House Speaker Daniel Perez and members of the House he once served with.
“Well, I mean everybody knows we had some scheduling changes in Washington,” Donalds said, referencing the decision by GOP leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives to cancel votes after failing to block a change in rules. 
Donalds was one of nine Republicans to buck GOP leadership and agree to allowing new parents serving in the chamber to vote by proxy. 
 “So, it opened up a day for me to come down here, have some meetings with people in Tallahassee about what their views are, what their goals are for the future of the state, share with them my thoughts. 
“And then, it’s always good to be back at the Florida House. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on the House floor.”
Donalds was a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2016 to 2020. He has served in Congress since 2021. 
In a media availability with reporters, Donalds defended President Donald Trump’s economic policies, played down recent Florida election results that saw Republicans win by smaller margins than in the recent past, and dismissed increasing tensions between Perez and Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Regarding the Perez-DeSantis relationship, Donalds said it’s “actually pretty typical.”
“I think the most unfortunate thing is now it’s spilling out,” he said. “They’re going to finish their business here. I’m quite sure that the governor, the House, and the Senate will come to a resolution on a lot of these issues.”
President Donald Trump has endorsed Donalds to be the next governor of Florida. The endorsement has strained his relationship with DeSantis, who has repeatedly said his wife, First Lady Casey DeSantis, would be a good choice to replace him. The first lady has not publicly announced any run.
Donalds said he didn’t collect any gubernatorial endorsements from state legislators while in Tallahassee.
He didn’t share his opinion about whether he preferred DeSantis’ approach to reduce property taxes or House Speaker Danny Perez’s push to pare back the state sales tax rate from 6% to 5.25% instead. Donalds said he didn’t want to get in the way of negotiations.
“Because, to be blunt, there’s one governor at a time. They are going to take care of this and we move on from here.”
He said the goal is to “make sure that the people of Florida are getting what they need.”

(File photo by Amanda Gokee/New Hampshire Bulletin)A Vermont-based company’s proposal to build a landfill in a tiny, northern New Hampshire town took a major blow this week.
The Department of Environmental Services issued a “denial by dormancy” Thursday to Casella Waste System’s solid waste permit application for its proposed landfill in Dalton. This permit is one of several sought by the company for the project, and without it, the project cannot go forward.
The company has 30 days to file an appeal with the state’s Waste Management Council. A Casella spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment regarding whether the company would do so.
For years, local residents have rallied against the project, citing its proximity to a pristine lake and forest, and related fears about how the landfill would impact the environment and public health. Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte joined them in their efforts, vowing in her inaugural address in January that the landfill would not be built. At the same time, solid waste management across the state has come under greater legislative scrutiny, especially after the state approved hotly contested updates to its landfill regulations in December.
A permit application becomes dormant when the applicant fails to submit required information requested by the department within a year of first being notified that the application is incomplete. For Casella, that one-year mark came on Feb. 28, according to a letter sent to the company Thursday by Mike Wimsatt, the agency’s solid waste management division director.
A dormant, incomplete application “shall be deemed denied without further action by the department,” per the letter.
Wimsatt said the application remained incomplete for a number of reasons. For one, it lacked a “site report that demonstrates that the location of the proposed facility complies with all applicable siting requirements and that the site is a suitable location for the proposed facility …,” according to the letter. Additionally, “the maps, figures, and hydrogeological report” submitted by the applicant in 2023 had not been updated to show compliance with the state’s regulations that were updated in December, Wimsatt said.
Legal agreements submitted by the company “failed to fulfill application requirements because they were heavily redacted and referenced other legal agreements, which were not provided,” Wimsatt said.
The company also had not submitted “copies of the documents that demonstrate that the applicant and their successors and assigns will have a legal right for the use of the properties as proposed in the application,” which the state requires, according to the letter.
For those who have invested years in fighting the landfill, it was a moment of optimism. But for many, the work doesn’t end in Dalton. Adam Finkel, a former federal regulator and Dalton resident who has advocated for solid waste reform in the state, pointed to pending legislation to bolster the state’s landfill siting requirements and other aspects of the recently updated regulations that raised deep concerns last year.
“Very happy that DES has done the right thing, but it doesn’t in any way, large or small, deter me from the larger goal,” Finkel said, “which is making sure that no community in New Hampshire ever has to deal with this kind of inept vanity project in a terrible location, unneeded, ever again.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7519-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 18:06:33.935065

Photo by A.J. Olmscheid/Senate Media Services.Minnesota Senate Democrats are proposing a first-in-the-nation tax on large social media companies that collect data on Minnesota consumers.
The bill, chief authored by Senate Taxes Committee Chair Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, would impose a tax on social media companies based on the number of monthly active Minnesota consumers from whom the company collects data.
Minnesota is facing a looming multi-billion dollar budget deficit, and lawmakers are working to cut spending and generate new revenue to offset the imbalance. In an interview, Rest said taxing social media companies is a solution that doesn’t hurt Minnesotans — it doesn’t cut critical social services or increase their taxes.
“We know we’re going to see some cuts, but I also felt it was my job to look for some fair ways to provide the revenue,” Rest said. “We’re talking about folks like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. We’ve been giving to them for years and years, and now we’re going to ask those social media businesses to participate in solving Minnesota’s budget challenges.”
Under the bill (SF 3197), if a social media company has fewer than 100,000 monthly consumers from Minnesota, it wouldn’t be taxed. If the social media company has between 500,000 and 1 million Minnesota consumers, the tax per month would be $40,000 plus 25 cents times the number of consumers over 500,000.
For the largest social media companies — those that have over 1 million Minnesota consumers — the tax per month would be $165,000 plus 50 cents times the number of consumers over 1 million.
The Department of Revenue estimates that the tax would apply to 15 social media companies. The tax, which would begin in January 2026, would generate around $46 million in the first fiscal year, $92 million in the second and about $100 million annually after that.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, reported $62 billion in profit in 2024, on $164 billion in revenue.
Even as the companies make hundreds of billions of profit, social scientists are sounding the alarm on the widespread use of the apps, especially by young people.
Republicans this year have said that they will not support any new taxes on Minnesotans, so lawmakers have been looking for areas to cut spending. When asked whether House Republicans would support a tax on social media companies, a spokesperson said no.
“Our position is no tax increases,” a House GOP caucus spokesperson said.
New York since 2021 has proposed taxing social media companies for data collection, or data mining, and a similar bill is again being considered by the New York Legislature this year.
Rest said that she hopes Minnesota’s legislation can be regarded as a model for other states that are experiencing budget shortfalls.

(Photo Courtesy NMHC website)An organization that provides small grants to uplift and explain New Mexico culture and history will have to close its doors, following deep cuts to the National Endowment for the Humanities and local humanities councils across the country.
The New Mexico Humanities Council has been around since 1972 and has provided schools, tribes, colleges, cultural centers, libraries and others grants to engage “New Mexicans with history, culture and humanities topics.” 
Recent events that credit the council include a Taos exhibition honoring Hispanic stories of northern New Mexico; a youth history competition; and virtual learning experiences at the New Mexico Farm & Ranch Heritage Museum in Las Cruces.
“Those will essentially go away,” said Brandon Johnson, executive director of the humanities council, in a phone interview Thursday with Source New Mexico. 
Johnson received two letters around 11 p.m. Wednesday from Michael McDonald, the acting director of the National Endowment for the Humanities, related to two NEH grants the council received. About $500,000 had not been awarded to the council, Johnson said, from what online records show were initially $11.3 million contracts.
“NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” McDonald wrote in the letter dated April 2, citing a February Trump executive order seeking to reduce the federal bureaucracy.

“Your grant’s immediate termination is necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal priorities. The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority for the administration,” McDonald wrote.
The letter goes on to note that an audit may still occur, even though the grants were terminated, and provides a Microsoft email address to contact “with only urgent questions.”
An unnamed official told NPR that McDonald recently told senior staff of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” team that he wants to “claw back” $175 million in grant money that has not been disbursed.
A large number of NEH employees will soon be fired, as well, according to the New York Times. 
Johnson said the news came as a shock and called the cuts “very disappointing,” though he acknowledged he’d withheld much stronger words he wanted to say about the abrupt cancellation of the program. He noted that the NEH has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades and that the council here has done great work across the state.

“That’s money that won’t go to our New Mexico communities,” he said. 
A statement from the National Alliance for the Humanities, an advocacy group, called on members of the public to fight back against the cuts, noting that the spending was already approved by Congress. 
“We condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms,” the alliance wrote. “We support the mission of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the agency staff who make that mission possible, and we call upon Members of Congress to ensure that this crucial government agency fulfills the mandate set by Congress.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NMHC-NHD-TopHat_0-4-2-web30.jpg,,,2025-04-03 18:06:33.935065

Kevin Stitt’s proposal to eliminate the state Forestry Service after the Republican criticized its response to wildfires last month.
The legislative remarks came a day after Stitt told reporters he wanted to axe the agency amid frustrations about its response to wind-fueled wildfires that ripped through parts of the state, damaging or destroying over 400 homes. Stitt said he lost a ranch in the blaze. 
He later fired Mark Goeller, the head of the Oklahoma Forestry Service. Goeller has said nothing was held back after Stitt criticized his agency’s response. The agency is responsible for preserving the state’s forests and is the primary state body responsible for wildland fire detection, prevention and suppression. Several firefighters have defended how Goeller handled the historic wave of fires that swept across the state.
Stitt on Wednesday said officials can’t get answers about where the resources were and questioned why the state had the agency, which takes up 33% of the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry’s budget to the tune of $75 million a year.
He suggested getting rid of it or giving a portion of the funds directly to local fire departments.
Republican lawmakers on Thursday criticized the suggestion.
“It sounds like a really bad idea to me,” said Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, a longtime volunteer fire firefighter.
Paxton said the Legislature created the Forestry Service, adding that it is a useful tool for the state.
He said he has had no conversation with Stitt about abolishing it.
It would have been a more prudent course of action to issue a burn ban earlier, Paxton said.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said elimination of forestry services is “unacceptable.”
Hilbert said he and other lawmakers are hearing from firefighters in their districts “who are frankly furious about what has happened and the insult not only to the Department of Forestry but also to the fire service in general.”
The state needs to fully fund and staff the positions in the Oklahoma Forestry Service, Hilbert said.
The mid-March fires left four dead and injured 200 people, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. A state of emergency was declared for 12 counties.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida high schoolers would not need to pass algebra or English final exams to graduate under a bill the Florida Senate unanimously passed Thursday.
That proposal is part of SB 166, which its sponsor, Sen. Cory Simon, a Republican representing 13 counties in the Panhandle and Big Bend, called public school “deregulation.”
The bill would remove a state requirement that students pass the Algebra I and 10th grade English finals. Students would still have to pass the classes notwithstanding a failing test score. (The test would count toward 30% of the course grade.)
“As we focus on providing parents with the choice in education, school districts must be given the chance to compete,” Simon said on the Senate floor Thursday. 
Last year, under Speaker Paul Renner, the House rejected removing the testing requirements. ExcelinEd, former Gov. Jeb Bush’s education think tank, opposed the idea then and now. In office, Bush established the A+ Plan for education, which put in place school grades based on student test scores and the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test.
Several school districts lobbied in support of the bill.
The bill would expand eligibility for teachers’ professional certificates, looks to enhance teacher recruitment, and would remove requirements for schools to have internal auditors. 
Third-graders who score a 1 out of 5 on their third and final reading progress monitoring tests could  advance to fourth grade if they scored a 2 on the first two progress-monitoring tests. A score of 3 is considered “on grade level.”

Students testing like ‘robots’
Simon said adding progress monitoring has allowed teachers to understand in real time how to shape instruction. 
In 2024, 55% of third graders could read at grade level. In 2023, that level was 50%.
“A few years ago, when we passed the universal school choice bill, we made an obligation to parents that we were going to fund students and we were going to fund their choice to choose the school that is best suited for them. Well, 75-to-80% of our parents are choosing our public schools, and it is part of the choice. It’s not the default,” Simon said. 
Focusing on test scores only can turn students into “robots,” Simon said. 
“​​We all learn differently, but we take a test that doesn’t focus on all of our strengths, and so it’s important for us to continue to do this work, making sure that our kids leave our schools, and they’re not defeated, they’re encouraged. They’re emboldened to take on their future,” Simon said. 
The bill looks to “level the playing field amid other school choice options,” Senate President Ben Albritton said in a news release. 
“None of this bill decreases the rigor of what our schools are doing. What we’re saying is, what they’ve done all should add up to something,” Simon told reporters following the vote. 
The bill does not have a companion in the House, which will have to pass it before the governor could sign it into law. 
“Thank you for your leadership and continued work on education and helping our public schools to have an environment where those that are running and trying to create policy to manage the district gets a little relief from all of the things that we mandate on them on the state level, as well as being focused on our children and helping them to learn and grow without overburdening them,” Sen. Rosalind Osgood, a Democrat representing part of Broward County said.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — A Senate committee on Thursday rejected the governor’s pick to lead the state’s public health agency over criticisms of the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
After running the Department of Health and Environmental Control for three years, Dr. Edward Simmer was Gov. Henry McMaster’s nominee to run the newly created Department of Public Health.
The second day of Simmer’s confirmation hearing brought a bigger, louder crowd that several times prompted Chairman Danny Verdin to call for decorum, as he both reminded a freshman senator of Senate rules and warned the audience he would clear the room.
The opposition centered around the state’s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccinations were in beginning stages when Simmer took over the department in February 2021.
The 17-member Senate Medical Affairs Committee voted 5-12 against recommending that the Senate confirm Simmer. But that doesn’t automatically reject Simmer’s nomination. It’s essentially on pause indefinitely. The full Senate could decide to take up his confirmation and vote, despite the committee’s disapproval, which is what McMaster is encouraging.
Simmer will remain interim director of the department for the time being.
“I remain resolute in my support of Dr. Ed Simmer and am hopeful that the full Senate will see through the falsehoods and mistruths being spread about his service to our state and nation,” McMaster said in a statement posted to X soon after the vote.
Odds appear to be against Simmer if the full Senate, which has a Republican supermajority, decides to take a vote on his confirmation. Only one of the committee’s 13 Republicans voted in favor of his confirmation Thursday.

“There’s just no way I can sugar coat it,” said Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney, before voting against advancing Simmer’s nomination. “I’m not telling you something you don’t already know. Your confirmation is facing an uphill battle.”
Unless a nominee has a glaring issue in their background, senators traditionally give the governor deference in confirming Cabinet nominees, said Sen. Tom Davis, the only Republican to join the panel’s four Democrats in a favorable vote.
“At the end of the day, do you truly think that the governor is in clear error?” the Beaufort Republican said to his fellow senators. “Do you think that he truly has put forward somebody who is unfit? Who is not qualified? Who doesn’t have the competency?”
This is not the first time the Senate has rejected one of McMaster’s nominees to a Cabinet position. In 2020, the full Senate voted 41-2 to reject McMaster’s nominee to run the Department on Aging over accusations that he made derogatory comments to women and minorities, which he denied.
The year before, another Senate committee gave an unfavorable report for McMaster’s pick to lead the board of state-run utility Santee Cooper, citing a lack of experience working for utilities.
Other Cabinet nominees over the years have withdrawn from consideration, knowing they either wouldn’t legally be able to take the role or didn’t have the votes. Among them were McMaster’s 2020 nominees to lead state departments overseeing veterans’ affairs and public safety, as well as former Gov. Nikki Haley’s choice to run DHEC in 2015.
Simmer sailed through the confirmation process in 2021, when senators voted 40-1 to confirm him. When he took the agency’s helm, it had been without a permanent director for eight months.
In his opening statement two weeks ago, and again in answers Thursday, he said his detractors were spreading lies about him and pointed to his accomplishments aside from the COVID-19 pandemic.
“There have been a lot of falsehoods said about me,” Simmer said Thursday. “I think, in the end, the results speak clearly.”
Senators didn’t ask about his background, and they asked little about other problems the state health department addresses, except to compliment the agency’s work. Instead, senators Thursday took aim primarily at the state’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
“To be clear, what’s being scrutinized is not your ability to lead the Department of Public Health during ordinary times but during extraordinary times, should another pandemic arise,” said Sen. Richard Cash, R-Piedmont.
Trying to encourage more people to get vaccinated, DHEC deployed mobile vaccination units, set up vaccine booths at events across the state and offered perks such as free beer to people willing to get the jab.
In each case, people getting vaccinated were advised of the possible rare side effects of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, Simmer said. He never required people to get vaccinated, nor did he support businesses mandating employees and visitors be vaccinated, he said.
What Simmer did was encourage people to get the vaccine if they chose, based on the information he had about it at the time, he said.
“No one forced anyone to get a vaccine,” he said. “I’ve never mandated anyone to get a vaccine.”
What Simmer described as encouragement, Verdin said he and other senators saw as a different sort of mandate, which they opposed.
Some senators repeated debunked claims that the COVID-19 vaccine contains harmful strands of DNA and questioned whether it was wise to offer the shot to children, despite its federal approval for that purpose.
Those concerns demonstrate a larger issue, Verdin said.
Following the pandemic, public trust in the state’s health care system — and, by extension, Simmer — frayed. Senators are looking for a nominee who can rebuild that confidence among the state’s residents, Verdin said.
“We need to enjoy a greater level of trust than we enjoy now, and that’s where I’m going to be putting all my energy and efforts,” the Laurens Republican said.
At issue was not whether Simmer was qualified, Verdin said.
Simmer spent three decades in the Navy, including overseeing Tricare Health Plan, the military’s massive health system for care outside military hospitals. As the head of DHEC, outside of pandemic response, he was very capable and accessible to legislators, Verdin said.
As a naval doctor, Simmer worked in psychiatry, which prompted Peeler to ask whether he might be interested in working instead at the Department of Mental Health, though Peeler didn’t clarify what role he had in mind.
Simmer said he’d leave that decision up to the governor and his wife.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-03-at-4.41.35-PM-1024x515.png,,,2025-04-03 18:06:33.935065

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A divisive prison sentencing bill introduced by Attorney General Drew Wrigley’s office failed in the House Thursday after more than 90 minutes of debate by lawmakers.
Senate Bill 2128 sought to make sure inmates in the state prison system spend most of their sentence behind bars.
This included a requirement that inmates spend at least half of their sentence in prisons before they can be eligible for a transitional center or parole.
It also contained provisions that would have established steeper penalties for fleeing and assaulting law enforcement.
North Dakota attorney general calls for more prison time; opponents say spend more on police

Earlier this week, the House Judiciary Committee voted 9-5 to forward the bill to House Floor with a do-not-pass recommendation. The House on Thursday rejected an amendment proposed by the committee, which included language giving lawmakers the option to study parole and the state corrections during the upcoming interim session.
“This bill is trying to make too many sweeping changes too quickly,” said Rep. Nels Christianson, R-Grand Forks, who carried the bill on the floor.
Opponents of the bill, which included the head of the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, have said Wrigley’s proposal would further encumber the state’s already overcrowded prisons. They also said it would have prevented inmates from accessing programs that reduce recidivism and help them prepare for life outside of prison.
“The Attorney General and Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation fundamentally disagree on the facts and the solutions, and we shouldn’t rush to make these sweeping changes to policy with far reaching consequences without having all the facts,” Christianson said.
Proponents of the bill said the proposals would best serve the interests of the public, as well as crime victims.
“We’re talking about the victim here, and the responsibility of the people in blue and brown,” said Rep. Bill Tveit, R-Hazen.
The original bill was estimated to cost the state $22.7 million in the 2025-2027 biennium and another $21.3 million for the 2027-2029 budget cycle.
The Senate in February passed the proposal by a 28-18 vote.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline) Colorado’s four Republican members of Congress urged Gov. Jared Polis to veto a bill that would set safety training requirements to purchase some firearms.
U.S. Reps. Jeff Hurd, Lauren Boebert, Jeff Crank and Gabe Evans sent the letter to Polis, a Democrat, on Wednesday asking him to reject Senate Bill 25-3, which has been passed by both chambers of the Legislature.
“Despite making some amendments to the legislation to appear less restrictive, the Colorado State Legislature proceeded with a partisan vote to pass one of the most restrictive gun ownership laws in the United States — on par with California and Illinois’ gun laws. The bill would impose a deceptive ‘permit-to-purchase’ system riddled with bureaucratic hurdles and impedes our constituents’ ability to freely exercise their right to self-defense,” the letter, first reported by Colorado Politics, reads.

SB-3 would limit the ability to purchase semiautomatic firearms with detachable magazines to those who have completed a safety training course — either four hours of training if they already have a hunter safety license or 12 hours if they do not. It would not criminalize possession, but it would be one of the largest changes to Colorado’s gun purchasing laws in recent years.
The bill originally would have outlawed those guns with detachable magazines outright, but it was amended in the Senate to create the permit-to-purchase system. It passed the Senate and House on partisan votes, with some Democrats joining Republicans in opposition.
It now sits on Polis’ desk for him to sign into law or veto. A bill can become law without the governor’s schedule after 10 days. It was officially sent to Polis on Thursday.
The congressional Republicans wrote that the process laid out in the bill is burdensome, time-consuming, potentially costly and violates the Second Amendment. A person would need to undergo a background check and obtain an eligibility card from their sheriff before they could enroll in a class. Sheriffs could deny applicants if they believe the person is a danger to themselves or others.
“Not only does this new scheme come with additional fees and time commitments that no criminal will ever participate in, but it also gives any sheriff hostile to the individual — or semi-automatic firearms in general — carte blanche authority to block the enrollment,” they wrote.
Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman wrote in a statement that the governor welcomes input on legislation that comes before him.
“The Governor was clear he would oppose banning any guns, and his team worked with the sponsors, and got feedback from the hunting and sport shooting community, and members of law enforcement to amend the bill to address the overarching concerns, remove any bans on guns, and ensure people could continue to purchase the gun of their choice. The final bill allows responsible Coloradans to continue to purchase the gun of their choice as long as they receive gun safety education,” she wrote.
Members of Congress do not often weigh in directly on matters at the state Legislature, unless a bill is especially controversial or consequential. Democratic Reps. Diana DeGette and Brittany Pettersen lent their support last month to Senate Bill 25-5, which would eliminate a second election required in the union organization process. That bill passed the Senate but has not been debated on the House floor. Polis has expressed desire for labor and business groups to work out a compromise on the issue.
The legislative session ends in about one month.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Funding for foster care has been slashed in the House Finance Committee as members opted to ignore Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s proposed budget, including his $182 million request for a child welfare system in crisis. 
There are more than 5,800 children in foster care, and there aren’t enough Child Protective Services workers, in-state available beds or services to help them. 
The House’s version of the fiscal year 2026 budget, up for passage this week, would give roughly $121 million to the Department of Human Services to manage its foster care system. 
The governor’s proposed budget was still less than what the department needed. It proposed $3 million for CPS, which was less than a third of what the agency had said it needed to hire more than 100 new CPS workers. The state’s CPS workers are often managing overwhelming caseloads.
Now, the agency could have to operate with even less.
Angelica Hightower, a DoHS spokesperson, said the original $182 million requested by the governor was “essential funding” to meet the ongoing needs of the Bureau for Social Services, including serving children in foster care and operating critical services for families. 
“In contrast, the proposed budget reduction put forward by the House Finance Committee would significantly hinder the department’s ability to deliver services effectively and respond to the pressing challenges currently facing the foster care system,” Hightower said. 
House Finance Chairman Vernon Criss, R-Wood, disregarded Morrisey’s budget, opting for the House to present its own budget bill that includes a surplus “cushion,” as he put it. “It’s our job to tell him how much money to spend,” he said. 
Criss said his committee looked at last year’s foster care funding to determine what to allocate for the upcoming fiscal year. 
“We didn’t necessarily take cuts from what he did, but what we did was ignore his budget entirely and used our ‘25 budget to drive a ‘26 budget,” he explained.
  Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, minority chair of the House Finance Committee, said that skinny budgets passed under Gov. Jim Justice meant that foster care had already been underfunded. Foster care can’t be fixed without putting money into it, he said. 
“When you have any foster kids living out of trash bags in a hotel, that is not a point in time in which you give tax breaks to the rich,” he said. “These programs are struggling.”
Morissey, when responding to a question from West Virginia Watch on Thursday, said that he put forth a “common sense proposal” on foster care funding. The state may need more funding to make positive changes to foster care, CPS and more, he said.
“My philosophy … is that when you have ongoing programs, you generally try to have ongoing revenue that matches. And that’s what we’re trying to do,” Morrisey said.
Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the House’s budget bill fell short of what was needed to truly improve child welfare outcomes. She cited more than $50 million in proposed cuts to Medicaid along with no new financial investments in public education.
“The ability to make those investments is hindered by a stubborn commitment to keeping the budget flat, even if that leaves critical needs unfunded,” she said. “Without making much-needed investments in evidence-based primary supports, it will be challenging to stem the untenable flow of children into our overburdened foster care system.”

Some line item increases for CPS and other child welfare
The House’s budget bill does include a few million dollars more specifically for CPS workers than what was requested by Morrisey. It also includes $5 million for guardians ad litems, which are attorneys who represent the interests of children in child welfare court proceedings. There’s also $1.8 million allocated to Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a volunteer program that helps abused and neglected children in the court system. 
  Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis
“I am glad to see we are making some investments in child welfare, specifically for our [guardian ad litems] and CASA. I can always wish that we would have received more for child welfare but these allocations shouldn’t be overlooked. Any investment is a step in the right direction,” said Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, a foster parent who has spearheaded child welfare legislation this session.  
Criss said he felt confident that DoHS would be able to adequately operate the foster care system under the House’s proposed budget.
“If not, we’ll be back in January, [and] there’ll be additional supplementals at that time,” he said. “We know that we’ve got a $100 million surplus in the current year.  If there’s monies left over, we’ll be able to maneuver and take care of things as things move along, and in January, we’ll have a better picture.”
The Senate’s budget version, vetted by the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, would fund foster care at the same level requested by the governor.
Morrisey said he believed that issues with foster care funding would be resolved by the end of lawmakers’ budget process. The legislative session is scheduled to adjourn April 12.
“There are some differences ….  I’m hopeful that as time goes on, the different parties are going to get together. I think that they will,” the governor said.  
Jaycie Bias is the executive director of the WV Foster, Adoptive & Kinship Parents Network, which represents 1,800 families.
Funding isn’t the issue, from her point of view. Instead, the state needs to focus on improving the quality of the foster care system. CPS workers are failing to check on children living in foster homes, she said, and reimbursement payments to foster families are irregular. 
“There are statues in place that aren’t being followed through,” she said. “The state is doing so little for us in terms of follow through that you are having people fall through the cracks.”
While the state struggles to have enough foster homes, Bias said DoHS prioritizing and communicating with those who are willing to foster — which doesn’t take money — would likely solve that problem.

StebbinsFollowing the Michigan Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold a key permit for Enbridge’s Line 5 tunnel project, members of four Native American Tribes and three environmental organizations are asking the Michigan Supreme Court to review the lower court’s decision, arguing it violates the public trust doctrine, alongside the state constitution and the Michigan Environmental Protection Act.
On Wednesday, the Great Lakes advocacy organization For Love of Water — or FLOW — announced it had filed an application for leave to appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court. The Bay Mills Indian Community, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi also filed a separate application for leave to appeal alongside the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Michigan Climate Action Network.

For many years, Native American tribes and environmental advocates have called for a shutdown to the pipeline, which transports more than 22 million gallons of crude oil and light synthetic crude daily from northern Wisconsin through the Upper and Lower Peninsula into Sarnia, Ontario. 
About four miles of the 645-mile long pipeline runs through the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet. The pipeline’s opponents have repeatedly warned that a spill into the Great Lakes would be catastrophic with a University of Michigan study finding the Straits would be the “worst possible place” for a Great Lakes oil spill, quickly contaminating nearby shorelines, with another study finding a spill could bring more than $6 billion in damage to the environment and local economies.
Additionally, a 2018 anchor strike which dented the pipeline in three places generated further concerns of a spill, with Enbridge later agreeing to replace the dual pipelines running through the Straits with a new segment inside a concrete-lined tunnel located beneath the lakebed in hopes of containing any spills. 
In order to move forward, the project must receive permits from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan Public Service Commission, the state’s energy regulator. 
Attorneys representing the tribes and environmental organizations argued the Commission had blocked them from presenting evidence challenging the public’s need for petroleum products transported by Line 5 and detailing the scope of the project’s environmental impact, and that the commission failed to consider the pipeline’s impacts on climate change and greenhouse gasses alongside evidence supporting alternatives to the tunnel.
However, the three judge panel hearing the case determined there was “no basis to reverse or remand” the commission’s permitting decision.
In its request to the Michigan Supreme Court, attorneys representing the tribes argue the Public Service Commission failed to properly consider the risk of oil spills when approving the project, violating the state constitution and state laws requiring agencies to protect the state’s natural resources from pollution and destruction.
“Even if the public has been misled into believing this tunnel project is safe, the truth is that it is not,” Whitney Gravelle, president of the Bay Mills Indian Community said in a statement.

 “Enbridge’s track record speaks for itself—catastrophic spills, environmental destruction, and a complete disregard for tribal sovereignty and the rights of future generations,” Gravelle said. “The Straits of Mackinac are not just a waterway; they are the heart of creation for Anishinaabe people and a vital source of life for all who depend on the Great Lakes. An oil spill here would be devastating, not only to our way of life but to the entire region.”

The Michigan Climate Action Network and the Environmental Law & Policy Center argued the Court of Appeals’ decision does not follow the Michigan Environmental Protection Act’s requirement of rigorous, independent determinations of all likely environmental effects of Enbridge’s proposed tunnel project.
“We are asking the Michigan Supreme Court to accept this appeal so that it can provide much needed guidance on the proper interpretation and application of Michigan’s Environmental Protection Act,” said David Scott, a senior attorney for the environmental law and policy center. “We hope that the Supreme Court will review this case because it involves important environmental, health, and welfare issues for the people of Michigan, and important legal issues for Michigan courts to properly and consistently fulfill their responsibility under the Environmental Protection Act.”
In its own brief, FLOW argues the commission is obligated to follow the public trust doctrine under common law, which requires the state to manage natural resources for the benefit of the public.
“The Great Lakes are a public resource of incalculable value,” FLOW’s Legal Director Carrie La Seur said in a statement. “The MPSC has a fundamental responsibility to protect these waters, and its decision-making must be guided by the public trust doctrine. The Court of Appeals’ ruling dangerously undermines that responsibility.”
Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy told the Michigan Advance in an email that the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the Commission’s permitting decision. 
“The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the MPSC appropriately examined the location of the Line 5 replacement segment within the Great Lakes Tunnel, consistent with Michigan law,” Duffy said. 
“As we proceed with this modernization project, we remain committed to operating Line 5 responsibly with enhanced safety measures in the Straits that protect Michigan’s natural resources and infrastructure in the Straits,” he said. 
While the tunnel project has also received permits from EGLE, the Department is currently reviewing two applications, one to redo its Wetlands Protection and Great Lakes Bottomlands permits and another for its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, which is intended to protect water quality by limiting the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a body of water.
The United States Army Corps of Engineers is still working to develop a draft environmental impact statement for the project, after announcing in March 2023 that it would extend its environmental review of the effort. The Corps is expected to issue the draft state this spring, though environmentalists and tribal nations have raised concerns that the Corps could fast track its consideration of the project following an executive order from President Donald Trump. 
“The federal government is bending over backwards to fast track required permits in support of a Canadian company’s fossil fuel project that provides minimal benefit to domestic energy production,” said David Gover, managing for the Native American Rights Fund. “But today, it’s up to Michigan’s courts and elected leadership to be responsible public stewards for clean water, for Tribal rights, and for every community along the Great Lakes.”

Gudger on Thursday said the Senate would not take up lottery or gambling proposals in the 2025 session. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The leader of the Alabama Senate said Thursday there would be no efforts to create a lottery or expand gambling in the state in the current legislative session.
Senate President Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said in a statement emailed after the chamber adjourned Thursday that passing gambling legislation in the chamber will require “long-term and intense negotiations among members” and votes to be secured before beginning another legislative session.
“With 12 meeting days remaining in the session, both budgets still awaiting approval, and other important bills and measures demanding focus and attention, the comprehensive gaming bill released today is simply too little, too late, and has too few votes to pass,” Gudger said in the statement.
The Senate leader’s statement came as Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, had been shopping what he described as a “trimmed-down” version of a gambling package filed last year that failed to pass the Legislature.  That package included a constitutional amendment and legislation to legalize a state lottery and gambling, which stalled in the Senate.

Albritton did not push back against Gudger’s statement in a phone interview Thursday afternoon, saying that “the last part of that phrase is the most accurate.”
He also confirmed he’s not introducing a bill in the 2025 legislative session.
“We’re not going to drop a bill this year,” Albritton said.
The gambling package failed last year amid disputes over what kinds of gambling would be offered and distribution of revenues. House sponsors were sharply critical of changes the Senate made to the package, and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said in February that the chamber would not bring its own version of the legislation. 
The state’s 1901 Constitution outlaws lotteries and gambling. Gambling that exists in the state operates under local constitutional amendments or on land owned by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, a federally-recognized tribe that runs casinos in Atmore, Montgomery and Wetumpka. Efforts to create a lottery or expand gambling have been stymied by divisions among Republicans in the Legislature; disputes among gambling interests and disagreements over distribution of gambling revenue.
Alabama is the only state east of the Mississippi without a lottery.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House of Representatives on Thursday voted 15-78 against a bill to give a tax cut to prison industries, sustaining Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s first veto in office.
Senate Bill 2261 would have provided businesses tax credits when they buy goods or services from Rough Rider Industries, a state agency that sells various products made by prison inmates. The tax credit would be equal to up to 10% of the cost of the purchase. The bill cleared the Senate with nearly unanimous support, and passed the House with about 63% support.
Armstrong issued the veto March 21, calling the tax incentive anti-competitive.
“This bill creates an uneven playing field by giving Rough Rider Industries an unfair competitive advantage over out-of-state manufacturers,” he wrote in the letter, which is addressed to Lt. Gov. Michelle Strinden, who is president of the Senate.
The Senate a few days later voted 45-2 to override the veto.

“The only thing this bill suggested was that if you’re an in-state manufacturer and looking for somebody to subcontract some of your equipment, some of your parts, that Rough Rider could be the folks you want to go to,” Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden said on the Senate floor. “Not only will that keep the folks at Rough Rider busy, but once again it’s training, giving those inmates valuable experience.”
Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, spoke against the bill on the Floor on Thursday. 
She said Rough Rider Industries didn’t ask for the tax credit and that the business is already successful.
“It will not bring in any new business,” she said. “All we’ll do is give a tax credit to companies that are already doing business with Rough Rider Industries, and it will not address our workforce shortages that we are seeing continually.”

Chip Campsen, Majority Leader Shane Massey and Stephen Goldfinch chat in the Senate chamber.

(File/Mary Ann Chastain/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The Senate passed a long-anticipated bill clearing the path for a new power plant in South Carolina and fulfilling its pledge to address future energy needs in the rapidly growing Palmetto State.
The legislation, approved 41-3, saw major changes to the sweeping energy bill halted last session over criticism that proponents had fast-tracked it through the General Assembly. Backers say it strikes a balance, empowering utilities charged with meeting the state’s energy needs but in a way that’s more palatable to consumer and environmental advocates.
The three Republicans voting “no” included Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey.
“We still have concerns but it’s nothing like what it would have been,” said Frank Knapp, president of the state’s Small Business Chamber of Commerce, who advocates on behalf of small business owners in the state.
The bill, sponsored by GOP House Speaker Murrell Smith of Sumter gives permission for Dominion Energy and state-owned utility company Santee Cooper to partner on a possible 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant on the site of a former coal-fired power plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
Santee Cooper customers should expect a double cost hike in 2025 after years of frozen rates

In its original form, the legislation saw significant pushback on its sweeping regulatory changes and rollback of consumer protections passed in the wake of South Carolina’s failed nuclear expansion.
A nuclear failure
Santee Cooper and Dominion’s predecessor, South Carolina Electric & Gas, abandoned an expansion of the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County in 2017, but not before they’d already jointly spent $9 billion. The debacle left power customers on the hook for much of that cost on a power plant that never produced a single kilowatt.
Angered by the failure, which was fraught with fraud and cost overruns, legislators cracked down. They fired and replaced the state’s utility regulators, loosened the leash on the state’s utility watchdog and put an extra set of eyes looking out for power customers in the state’s consumer protection agency.
As originally proposed, the House bill would have undone some of that work, consumer groups warned.
In response to those concerns, new committee-level leadership in the House made its own changes: keeping the consumer advocate in place and doing away with a proposal that would have reduced the size of the panel regulating power companies in the state.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

The Senate, in a debate that stretched nearly until midnight Wednesday, tweaked the House legislation further after leadership cautioned against changes that could swing the law too far in power companies’ favor following the nuclear fiasco.
“Those who are Santee Cooper or Dominion customers, you are paying for V.C. Summer. You’re going to be paying for V.C. Summer for the next 14 years even though you’re not getting anything from it. And now the proposal is that we pay to build a new gas plant at Canadys,” said Massey, R-Edgefield. “That is my biggest heartburn on this.”
“They’re essentially going to be asking, if not forcing, customers to pay for two power plants when they only needed one,” he added.
The companies will still need the OK of state regulators to begin construction, as well as state and federal permits to connect to an interstate natural gas line needed to fuel the plant.
The other two Republicans voting “no” were Sens. Shane Martin of Spartanburg County and Tom Corbin of Greenville County. Massey, who co-led a Senate investigation into the V.C. Summer debacle, voted against it over his continued disgust over the nuclear fallout, but not before pushing for major changes.
Data center demand
Among those Senate changes are limitations on power-related incentives the state allows for data centers.
Massey said the amendment mirrors efforts by utility regulators in Georgia to say the cost of providing electricity to these centers, full of power-gobbling computer servers that run technologies ranging from artificial intelligence and 5G streaming of videos on mobile devices to high-speed financial trades, is borne by those companies.
Utility executives have testified that the largest of these centers can use upwards of 200 megawatts each and are a driving force, over and above residential and manufacturing growth, behind the state’s need for more power.
Sen. Chip Campsen, R-Isle of Palms, told the Senate that power usage by data centers in South Carolina is equivalent to 65% of demand from residential customers.
Data centers gobble up energy. Should SC block them from getting special deals?

At the same time, Dominion brokered a discount electricity deal for a $510 million Google data center proposed near Summerville. The deal, approved by utility regulators last year, allowed the Virginia-headquartered utility to grant Google a special “economic development rider” rate — 6 cents for every kilowatt hour, compared to 14 cents that residential customers were paying at the time.
Utilities have said, even if data centers don’t come, South Carolina will need more power to meet federal regulations requiring them to eventually shut down coal-fired plants in favor of more carbon-friendly options.
But if more of these center for come to the state after May 30, 2025, Massey said he wants them to pay an equivalent share of the costs for power plants built to serve them.
Permitting power
Still, the bill contains some wins for utility companies, too.
It starts by setting time limits on the environmental permitting process, as well as lawsuits that power executives testified are often used to drag out the building of new power plants and natural gas pipelines for decades, to the point that theconstruction projects are no longer financially feasible.
The House took steps to limit the permitting timeline to six months.
SC nuclear reboot sees interest from big tech, large utilities

To appease environmental concerns, the Senate passed an amendment to say the clock doesn’t start until regulators deem an environmental application is completely filled out. The change came after the Conservation Voters of South Carolina said it’s not uncommon for companies to submit these applications while they’re still missing all of the information needed to evaluate them.
The Senate also added a provision urging South Carolina’s court system to handle legal appeals of permitting decisions within a year’s time. And the bill pulls the state Appeals Court from the series of courts that hear these cases.
“I do think that the appellate process has been abused and and that’s why I think we ought to shorten that process,” Massey said.
Paying for power
Finally, the Senate added a section to the bill that would make it easier for utilities to raise power bills on an annual basis.
In their pitch, utility executives testified about comments from customers made during the company’s recent rate hike. Dominion’s South Carolina President Keller Kissam said customers asked why the utility didn’t raise rates on a smaller but more frequent basis, making it easier for those on a fixed income to adjust.

Kissam said the state uses a similar process for natural gas rates.
Utilities would go before regulators annually for up to five years to seek permission to raise prices. Rate payers can still protest and regulators still have the final say so over whether expenses meet the necessary requirements for an increase. But the process is less in depth because it doesn’t call into question a utility company’s allowed profit margin.
The process includes a cap. So, unlike the legislation that paved the way for the V.C. Summer debacle, it can’t be used to pay for a major project, such as the proposed Canadys gas plant, while it’s still under construction.
Consumer advocates, environmental groups and businesses organizations, large and small, opposed the measure.
They argued, while gradual annual increases might ease the burden for customers, power companies also would be less incentivized to hold down costs.
The state would review the process after five years to determine if its working the way utilities claim.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner) Justice Ann Walsh Bradley will retire from the Wisconsin Supreme Court in July with one more title on her curriculum vitae: chief justice.
Bradley, the Court’s most senior member, was elected by her colleagues Thursday to serve as the leader of the Court. She’ll succeed outgoing Chief Justice Annette Ziegler, whose second two-year term in the top position ends April 30.
Bradley’s term will run about two months starting May 1, and she’ll step down June 30 in anticipation of her retirement. In preparation for that, the justices also elected Justice Jill Karofsky to fill out the remainder of the two-year chief justice term, ending April 30, 2027. 
Both Bradley and Karofsky, who was elected to the Court in 2020, are members of the Court’s liberal majority. 
From the late 19th century to the mid-2010s, the state Supreme Court’s chief justice had been selected by seniority. In 2015, a constitutional amendment drafted by the Legislature’s Republican majority changed the selection process to a majority vote of the Court’s seven justices. The amendment also instituted a two-year term for the chief justice.
The amendment was aimed at unseating Justice Shirley Abrahamson, the Court’s first woman justice. Abrahamson had been chief justice since 1996, the second-longest to serve in the position. After voters ratified the amendment in April 2015, a majority of the justices — at the time, five conservatives — elected Justice Pat Roggensack chief. They reelected her in 2019, then elected Ziegler as her successor in 2021.
Bradley said in a statement that her election as chief justice is a “tremendous honor.”
“It has been my life’s goal to honor the rule of law, enhance access to justice, and serve the 5.9 million people who call Wisconsin home,” Bradley said. “Serving as Chief Justice enables me to further those goals.” 
Bradley also participated in her final oral arguments Thursday morning, where Ziegler delivered kind words about her and called attention to her thorough resume and accomplishments
Prior to her time in law, Bradley served as a high school teacher before earning her law degree at UW-Madison Law School in 1976. Bradley worked in private practice, as a city attorney and as a public defender, including being appointed to the state public defender board in 1983.
In 1985, Bradley was appointed to serve as a circuit court judge in Marathon County. 
Bradley won her first term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1995, and was reelected for two consecutive terms in 2005 and 2015. She decided to retire this year and will be succeeded by Justice-elect Susan Crawford, who defeated her challenger Brad Schimel Tuesday ensuring a 4-3 liberal majority on the Court until at least 2028. 
Ziegler said Bradley has likely heard over 2,400 cases in oral arguments, give or take some cases, during her many years of service.
“I can assure you it’s quite impressive,” Ziegler said. “I don’t know how many opinions that you’ve written, Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, but that number is also certainly impressive, and so, I would like to thank you Justice Ann Walsh Bradley for your service to the public and your service on this court.” 
Bradley thanked Ziegler and said that it’s been an honor to serve. She also thanked her husband and family for their support throughout the years. 
“People ask me, ‘Will you miss this place and miss this job?’ And, of course, I will,” Bradley said. “What makes this job is not only the heavy responsibility and an opportunity to serve, but an opportunity to serve with people who care deeply about the rule of law and care deeply about the people of this state.”
Karofsky said in a statement about her election to serve as chief justice that she appreciates the confidence of her colleagues and she will “continue to work respectfully with every member of this Court to ensure the administration of Court business is conducted in a fair and efficient manner.” 
“The people of Wisconsin have great faith in this Court, and I intend to be a Chief that increases the people’s confidence even further,” Karofsky said. “I hope to be someone that every judge and staff person in the judicial system finds approachable, so we can continue to improve the service we provide in all 72 counties, keeping each of us safe and ensuring access to justice.”

Torrez filed a civil suit against Disabled Veterans Consultants, Inc. Thursday claiming the company violated the Unfair Practices Act by using unfair and deceptive trade practices and unconscionable trade practices. During a press conference in Las Cruces, Torrez said the company offers consulting services to veterans to help access their benefits. However, the company is not accredited with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs as they are required to be to charge for services. And such services are provided to veterans for free through various agencies, including Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion and Disabled American Veterans.
Torrez described the company as a “claimshark,” or “organizations who prey upon our veterans in their moment of need when they’re trying to access the disability benefits that they’re entitled to as a result of their service to our country.” He said such companies often offer to process claims on behalf of veterans for large fees or percentages of the person’s benefits.
“Sadly, this country has not invested enough in supporting our veterans. This country, indeed, this state, has not invested enough in supporting our veterans,” Torrez said. “We have men and women who have honorably served this country who have disabilities as a result of their service who don’t realize or may not have access to free services to help.”
Court documents also state that payments the company received from veterans were not made to the company itself, but to Zeplin Global Group, LLC; MJJL Holdings, LLC; and GTM Bookkeeping, LLC – codefendants in the suit and all based out of Chula Vista, California. 
Torrez is asking the court to grant an injunction to prohibit the company from continuing to operate in such a manner. According to court documents, Torrez is asking that the company issue full refunds to the impacted veterans, cancel all contracts and pay fines of up to $5,000 per violation.
“The action that we have taken today is intended to send a very clear signal to claimsharks, both in this community in Las Cruces, but around the state, that this kind of conduct will not be tolerated by my office,” Torrez said. “We will be aggressively investigating anyone who is engaged in this conduct.”
Brian Ravak, state commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, told members of the media during Thursday’s press conference that state and federal legislation should be passed to further protect veterans from bad actors.
“The VFW, along with the American Legion and [Disabled American Veterans], have actively urged Congress to pass legislation that would prohibit the exploitation of veterans and survivors of unscrupulous claimsharks and strengthen the accreditation system,” Ravak said. “Each of our organizations have accredited veteran service officers who file VA claims for free – not one dime of a veteran’s benefits goes to a veteran service organization.”
He also mentioned House Bill 245, legislation introduced during the recent session that died in the House Judiciary Committee, which would have prohibited companies or individuals from asking for payment for helping a veteran obtain their benefits, unless they were permitted to ask for compensation under federal law.
Ravak said he will “demand” the bill be reintroduced in a future legislative session.
At least three states have passed such legislation, while Louisiana passed a law last year that would allow consulting companies to charge veterans up to $12,500 in fees for benefit services.
Torrez said the case against the Las Cruces company is still in the early stages and it is unclear at this point how many veterans may have been taken advantage of. 
“I can tell you that while this is the first action that we’ve taken against a claimshark in this space, it almost certainly won’t be the last,” he said. 
He added that the state and federal government have expanded eligibility for benefit claims, but have not increased capacity for processing the higher number of claims, creating an “opportunity for businesses like this, and unethical and unscrupulous people, to step into that space and take advantage of folks.”
Torrez said veterans are encouraged to reach out to his office if they have a complaint about how their benefits were processed, particularly if they were asked to sign over a portion of their benefits to a consultant.

(Photo by Bill Oxford/ Getty Images)Following reports that mass firings at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services wiped out the entire staff of the federal low income heating assistance program, Maine’s two senators sent a letter to the head of the agency warning of potentially devastating consequences. 
The Low Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is federally funded and provides financial assistance to help lower income households afford energy bills, weatherization, and energy-related home repairs. 
Republican Susan Collins and independent Angus King, along with 11 of their Senate colleagues, penned a letter to Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday, urging him to “reverse course on any staffing or funding cuts that would jeopardize the distribution of these funds to our constituents.”
While the program remains in effect, its roughly 20 federal staffers were reportedly among the approximately 10,000 HHS workers terminated this week as part of a mass layoff to make the agency “more responsive and efficient.” 
The senators wrote that, if true, the terminations “will undermine the HHS’s ability to deliver this critical funding to low-income seniors and families.” In addition, they noted that local community action programs that help enroll qualified residents could also be weakened by cuts undertaken by HHS and billionaire advisor Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 
Maine has seen a sizable increase in applications for LIHEAP in recent years, jumping from 45,000 in 2019 to 70,000 in the past year, according to the Maine State Housing Authority.
For fiscal year 2025, Maine was awarded about $37.6 million in LIHEAP funds with an additional $1.4 million for the Wabanaki Nations, according to Collins’ office. 
In the letter, the senators noted that states “are expecting HHS to release nearly $400 million in FY25 funding later this month. Any delay in providing this funding will set back efforts to provide summer cooling grants, weatherize low-income homes, and plan for the next winter heating season.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Testimony from the author of the 2022 report detailing how Florida property insurers gave millions to shareholders and billions to out-of-state affiliates while claiming financial ruin left some lawmakers on a House panel Thursday feeling like insurance regulators had lied to them.
The report at issue has prompted legislators to seek greater oversight over the flow of money from insurers to affiliates. House members have also questioned former and sitting insurance commissioners, who struggled to explain why they didn’t bring attention to the reports’ findings in 2022.
Jan Moenck, who wrote the report for Risk & Regulatory Consulting, told the Insurance & Banking Subcommittee Thursday that the firm submitted to the Office of Insurance Regulation its final draft on April 1, 2022, and didn’t receive any feedback or requests for changes, so RRC considered its work done.
Insurance regulators struggle to explain why stunning 2022 report wasn’t made public

That statement from Moenck prompted more questions from committee members, who heard testimony in March from OIR’s former and sitting heads that the report hadn’t been published because it was a draft and needed further review before release.
“You’re at your final draft, so it is inaccurate for them to have said you were not finished. So either they weren’t telling us the truth or you weren’t telling the truth. Which one was that?” Riverview Republican Rep. Danny Alvarez asked Moenck.
“In our mind, we had our final draft,” Moenck responded under oath.
House wants to dig deeper
The report sat until a Tampa Bay Times article brought it to the surface, highlighting how property insurers claimed losses following hurricanes Irma in 2017 and Michael in 2018, yet had paid $680 million in dividends to shareholders and billions in fees to affiliated companies for basic services.
The panel signaled that it would try to get more answers from OIR, with the subcommittee chair, Port Richey Republican Rep. Brad Yeager, telling reporters that the lack of communication from the regulating office after RRC submitted the final draft was telling.

Additionally, Yeager said, House Speaker Daniel Perez had authorized the subcommittee to find a firm to investigate shortcomings in the way regulators monitor insurer-affiliate relationships.
Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart, during the Thursday meeting, asked whether there would be more testimony from OIR.
“What is being revealed basically says they lied to us. They had a completed report and did not let us know that it was completed,” she said.
Not all lawmakers are convinced the Legislature should continue delving into the affiliate relationships. Delray Beach Republican Rep. Mike Caruso, a close ally of Gov. Ron DeSantis, used air quotes when talking about the investigation House Speaker Daniel Perez called for the subcommittee to carry out.
Caruso said some of the insurance companies that appeared to syphon money to their affiliates were paying them to do all of the claims processing.
What is OIR saying?
But OIR Commissioner Michael Yaworsky, who assumed the role in early 2023, rejected the notion in a phone interview with the Phoenix that he lied to lawmakers. He told the panel on March 14 that OIR in 2022 was dealing with the insolvency of several companies and investigating other insurers.
“If there’s a thought out there that OIR, or an OIR employee, or myself lied to them, that’s just not accurate,” Yawaorsky said. “I think what we’re getting caught up in is the mechanics of how projects such as these are completed, typically.”

The commissioner maintains that the report doesn’t provide a full picture because several insurers didn’t provide any or all information required for the analysis, which he emphasized wasn’t Moenck’s fault.
“There was extensive back and forth between the office and Moenck up to a certain point, and I think it seemed like it was the point that the market was collapsing that that communication stopped,” he said. “It did seem to stop at a point with no additional follow-ups.”
David Altmaier, OIR commissioner in 2022, echoed Yaworsky’s sentiment about the frenzy in the industry at the time the office received the report.
“Hindsight being 20/20, there’s probably some opportunities where I could have poked a little bit to make sure that this work was continuing. But, as the commissioner said, we were dealing with a lot,” Altmaier told lawmakers last month.
Months after the office had the report, the Legislature met for a special session in December that resulted in changes making it harder for policyholders to sue insurers, who claimed frivolous lawsuits drove up insurance premiums.
Lawmakers in the Insurance & Banking Subcommittee advanced a proposal, HB 881, that would require insurers to demonstrate that fees, commissions, and other payments to affiliates are fair and reasonable. The statutory lack of definition of fair and reasonable fees has also been at the center of discussions in the Legislature this year.
The bill approved Thursday states that when weighing whether a fee or commission is fair and reasonable, OIR must look at the actual cost of the service the affiliate provided to the insurer, the financial condition of both companies, the level of debt, the amount and purpose of payments and dividends, whether the contract benefits the insurer, and other information the office needs to made the determination.
However, similar bills appear stalled in the Senate at the midway point of the session.
Yaworsky said the office would have a difficult time complying with a legislative demand to produce a similar report with more recent data.
“We’re a pretty cash-strapped agency, and the House currently has us set to lose 20 full-time employees in their budget,” he said.

,DC,2025-04-03 20:41:01+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Senate confirms Dr. Oz to lead Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-confirms-dr-oz-lead-centers-medicare-medicaid-services,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed former television personality and onetime Pennsylvania political candidate Mehmet Oz as director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.The 53-45 party-line vote places Oz at the helm of the federal agency responsible for administering health care programs relied on by 1 in 4 Americans, including children, seniors and lower-income people.His confirmation comes as Republicans in Congress look to Medicaid, a state-federal partnership that covers medical expenses for some low-income and older Americans, as a source for hundreds of billions in spending cuts to help pay for extending the 2017 GOP tax law.Oz testified during his confirmation hearing in mid-March that there are several “painful truths” confronting federal programs within CMS.“Health care expenditures are growing 2 to 3% faster than our economy; not sustainable. The Medicare trust fund will be insolvent within a decade, that’s the 2.9% taken out of your paycheck,” Oz said. “Medicaid is the number one expense item in most states, consuming 30% of those state budgets, and that’s crowding out essential services like schools and public safety that many of you spent your careers trying to develop. Our health care cost per person in this country is twice that of other developed nations.”Oz said that chronic disease, which he argued is “linked to poor lifestyle choices,” drives much of the federal spending on health care. He singled out obesity as a central issue.Oz testified he intended to “empower beneficiaries with better tools and more transparency,” “incentivize health care providers to optimize care with real-time information” in part by using artificial intelligence to “liberate doctors and nurses from paperwork,” and modernize efforts that track waste, fraud and abuse.‘Ludicrous wellness grifting’Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said during the hearing that Oz’s comments during a failed Senate campaign about privatizing Medicare were unacceptable.Wyden also criticized Oz for promoting products on this daytime television show that had no scientific research supporting their claims of improving people’s health or preventing disease.  “Dr. Oz has used his program to promote some of the most ludicrous wellness grifting that I've heard about to date,” Wyden said.Idaho Republican Sen. Mike Crapo, chairman of the committee, said during a floor speech Thursday that Oz was well qualified to run CMS.“At his hearing, Dr. Oz spoke strongly about his desire to modernize the CMS and encourage a healthy lifestyle for all Americans,” Crapo said. “His vision for treating the underlying causes of chronic disease and equipping providers with innovative technologies to serve patients will also be a much- needed sea change at CMS.”CMS scopeThe agency manages several federal health programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the health insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act.The agency spent more than $1.5 trillion during the last full fiscal year, about 22% of all federal spending.The more than 6,000 people who work at CMS as well as contractors “process over one billion Medicare claims annually, monitor quality of care, provide the states with matching funds for Medicaid benefits, and develop policies and procedures designed to give the best possible service to beneficiaries,” according to the latest financial report.CMS is one of many agencies housed in the Department of Health and Human Services that is subject to restructuring plans from Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Oz backgroundOz received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University before earning a joint M.D. and MBA from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Wharton Business School.He starred in the daytime show “Dr. Oz,” which ran from 2009 until 2022.He won the Republican primary in the 2022 Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race but was defeated during the general election by Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.When President Donald Trump announced in November he intended to nominate Oz to lead CMS, he wrote that Oz would “cut waste and fraud within our Country’s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation’s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget.”",,,,2025-04-03 17:05:57.136078

The 13 spending bills use about $2.1 billion less overall and $800 [&#8230;]","House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, speaks Thursday at a news conference on the Missouri state budget. Deaton was joined, from left, by state Reps. Bishop Davidson of Republic, Wendy Hausman of St. Peters and John Voss of Cape Girardeau (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).The Missouri House sent the state Senate a budget of almost $48 billion to fund state agency operations in the coming fiscal year, a spending plan almost certain to grow as the upper chamber adds more money for public schools and child care.
The 13 spending bills use about $2.1 billion less overall and $800 million less in general revenue than recommended by Gov. Mike Kehoe when he presented his budget plan in January. More than half of the general revenue savings are cuts to Medicaid spending based on newer estimates of enrollment in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Some of the other reductions are due to paring back state employee pay raises, cutting spending lines where no money is actually available and shifting incomplete projects to a reappropriation bill that is not included on the bottom line.
The budget plan didn’t just cut money from Kehoe’s proposal. There were several small additions for state agencies, like $28 million for deferred maintenance on college campuses; extra pay raises for Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers and commercial vehicle inspectors at a cost of $8.4 million; and 20 new holistic defense social workers in the Office of Public Defender at a cost of $1.2 million.
There are also 105 earmarked items with a total cost of $170 million, including $142.7 million in general revenue. The projects range in size from $25,000 for a road project in St. Joseph to $19 million for a new state park in the district of House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
“We’re proud to have found savings and efficiencies across state government,” Deaton said at a news conference after the House action. “We also continue to have a really historic surplus, although it is being drawn down, but still leaving $2 billion on the bottom line.”
State Rep. Del Taylor, a St. Louis Democrat, said talking about how much was cut doesn’t impress him.
“We don’t measure ourselves in dollars saved and oh, ‘I cut $100 million out of this budget and that budget,’” he said. “What we really need to be measuring ourselves on is, are we addressing the needs of our people with funding for those non-profit organizations that our state has partnered with.”
 State Rep. Del Taylor, a St. Louis Democrat, is surrounded by other members of the Democratic caucus as a Thursday news conference about the Missouri state budget (Rudi Keller/Missouri Indepenent).
The state had a balance of $3.8 billion in the general revenue fund as of Monday, down from historic high of about $5.7 billion set in 2023. The budget on its way to the Senate spends $14.4 billion in general revenue, which would require about $900 million from the accumulated surplus if revenue meets expectations.
Democrats found a lot to like in the budget, even if they were not pleased with the outcome on school funding and child care subsidies.
“House Democrats were able to make a number of changes to the budget for the betterment of their communities and the state, and it was a refreshing change from what we’ve endured in recent years,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune of Kansas City.
Most of the 13 bills passed with fewer than 10 votes against them. The largest number of opposition votes came on the bills funding the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and elected officials, where $50 million for private school tuition scholarship program called  MOScholars is appropriated.
There is new anti-diversity, equity and inclusion language in the bill funding the Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development as well as long-standing language denying in-state tuition to undocumented immigrant students who live in the state. However, despite raising objections on the floor, many Democrats supported the bill as it passed 117-17.
State Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said Democrats had a tough choice on whether to support the higher education spending bill. The votes in favor of it were not traded for earmarks, she said.
“There’s no price act, no amount of money that would make the House Democrats sacrifice our values, our morals and our commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion in the state,” she said. “My calculation was, and always will be, how do I bring home the most investments to the most Missourians without sacrificing the values of the House Democratic Caucus?”
There is almost $500 million tied up in budget lines that are sure to get a lot of attention during Senate deliberations.
The largest is $300 million for the school foundation formula. Under the calculation establishing how much should be spent on public schools, the basic rate for state aid, called the state adequacy target, is $7,145 per pupil. The House budget plan only funds an adequacy target of $6,760 per student.
Kehoe did not include the increase in his budget and neither did the House. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough of Springfield has said he will find the money.
One item Democrats wanted to eliminate is the $50 million appropriation for the MOScholars program. The program, expanded last year, has not attracted the donations expected and is the first time the state is making grants of tax dollars to pay tuition at private and parochial schools.
Hough has also said he intends to restore a cut to Kehoe’s budget for child care subsidies. Kehoe asked lawmakers to use $107 million of new federal funding for child care to revise how providers are paid. Instead of being paid based on attendance at the end of a month, providers would get their money at the beginning of the month based on the number of children enrolled.
The child care money isn’t in the budget, Deaton said, because it could become a cost to the general revenue fund.
“I really never even got to the point of, is this good public policy? Is this bad? Is this a better idea? Is this a better way to do it, or not?” Deaton said “We really never even got past the fiscal concerns of can we make this work year in and year out?”
The problems with the current program, plagued by late or missed payments since the launch of a new computer processing system, make the changes proposed by Kehoe essential, Fogle said.
“We sat in that budget hearing room for countless hours,” Fogle said, “listening to people cry and scream and express their frustration about our inability to do our job as a General Assembly and the department to get those dollars out the door.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Laura Brion was supposed to spend Thursday preparing for the following day’s kickoff to a series of community lead safety workshops.
Instead, the executive director of Childhood Lead Action Project sat stiffly against the wooden benches of a dimly lit third-floor federal courtroom in Providence, listening to lawyers argue case law and legal theory as it relates to federal agencies’ distribution of congressionally approved grants and aid.
The Childhood Lead Action Project is one of the many nonprofits nationwide awarded funding under Biden-era spending packages, yet suddenly unable to access the money after President Donald Trump took office. Its $500,00 grant would have covered the cost of training for landlords and community health workers about lead safety laws and the ramifications of childhood lead poisoning. It would have also paid for one new employee — increasing the nonprofit’s small but mighty team from five to six people.
Now, Brion is stuck in limbo, unable to hire or prepare for workshops without any guarantee that the funding her organization was promised, and had started to draw down, would continue. 
“I’ve managed a lot of federal grants in my career,” Brion said in an interview outside the courtroom. “I’ve never had anything like this happen before.”
She is not alone; thousands of nonprofits nationwide have had federal funds yanked out from underneath them, leading to canceled contracts, pauses on hiring and the threat of employee layoffs. So contends a lawsuit filed by a half-dozen nonprofits, including Rhode Island’s Childhood Lead Action Project, the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council and Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District. 










This is about childhood lead poisoning, which we know is preventable. We have a signed grant award. There’s no reason we shouldn’t be able to do this. 


– Laura Brion, executive director for the Childhood Lead Action Project


The March 14 complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island has already amassed hundreds of pages of legal documents and exhibits from attorneys representing the nonprofits, as well as the federal agencies they are challenging. Thursday marked the first opportunity for each side to make their points in front of Rhode Island District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy.
The case echoes the many federal lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump’s executive actions and the loss of funding for research universities, state governments, arts organizations, and education, among others. The frenzy of legal action has cast new scrutiny on the powers of the executive branch.
This time, arguments hinged on a 1946 law that defined the powers and authorities of federal agencies.

Who’s got the power?
Lawyers with D.C. nonprofit Democracy Forward and Providence firm DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Ravens argued that federal agencies violated the Administrative Procedures Act by suddenly pausing grants and aid already awarded to nonprofits under Biden-era Congressional spending packages. 
“There is no reasonable basis — the government has offered none — to freeze first and ask questions later,” Jessica Morton, senior counsel with Democracy Forward, said during arguments Thursday.
Morton also sought to differentiate the complaint from a January lawsuit in D.C. filed by a group of nonprofits affected by federal funding freezes. That complaint centered on general grants and aid, not specific awards made through Biden-era spending packages. The D.C. complaint is also limited to the Office of Management and Budget and its director; the Rhode Island case spans another half dozen federal agencies and cabinet members, including the Environmental Protection Agency and departments of Agriculture and the Interior. 


Plaintiffs 
Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council
Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District
Childhood Lead Action Project
Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation
Green Infrastructure Center
National Council of Nonprofits 
Defendants 
Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins
Department of Energy and Secretary Chris Wright
Department of the Interior and Secretary Doug Bergum
Environmental Protection Agency and Administrator Lee Zeldin
Department of Housing and Urban Development and Secretary Scott Turner 
Office of Management and Budget and Director Russell Vought
National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett


But Daniel Schwei, the U.S. Department of Justice attorney representing the Trump administration, argued that the Rhode Island lawsuit was duplicative of its D.C. predecessor, since the National Council for Nonprofits was a plaintiff in both cases. 
After McElroy appeared unpersuaded by Schwei’s allegations of redundancy, he quickly moved on to his next defense: that there was never a broad funding freeze at all. 
Schwei in court filings included testimony from the U.S. Department of Energy — one of the federal agencies named as defendants — confirming that it was no longer pausing access to federal funds for one of the case’s affected nonprofits as of late February. Two other nonprofits, the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council and the Green Infrastructure Center, were able to access U.S. Department of Agriculture grants as of March 31, according to court documents. The grants were paused at the time the lawsuit was filed. 
“I don’t think there’s any proven basis for concluding these reviews are just indefinite pauses,” Schwei said. “The money is going out the door in some cases.”
Schwei focused much of his argument on legal doctrine around federal agency powers, citing, among other examples, a 1993 U.S. Supreme Court ruling concluding that there was no opportunity for judicial review in Congress’ decision to end its annual appropriation to the Indian Health Service.
“The fundamental question in this case is whether federal agencies, upon a new administration taking office, may pause federal funding and review it to ensure consistency with the president’s priorities,” Schwei said. “We think the answer is yes.”
McElroy, who interrupted Morton and Schwei multiple times with questions, sought to differentiate between federal spending generally allocated by Congress, and spending already awarded to specific individual recipients through competitive grants.
“At its fundamental level, this isn’t an issue of what the agencies are doing or what priorities they’re setting,” McElroy said. “The government is entitled to do that. The question is how, and what comes first: the freeze or the review?”
The three-hour hearing was heavy on legal doctrine and case law. But the consequences for nonprofits nationwide, and the communities they serve, are far more tangible.
“These laws support projects that keep children safe from lead exposure, renovate homes of low-income Americans to keep them safe from mold and carbon monoxide exposure, help family farms make the most of technology to stay in business, conserve irreplaceable natural resources, promote resilience in the face of natural disasters, support local economies, and much more,” attorneys for the nonprofits wrote in their March 17 complaint. 
Years of work building trust and relationships with the communities they serve also took a major hit when funding was cut off, Morton said.
Stuck in limbo
When, or if, federal funding to the Childhood Lead Action Project is restored, it will be tough to recruit a new hire when candidates know the money that pays for their job might be turned off at any moment, Brion said in a written statement to the courts.
Alicia Lehrer, executive director of the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, was reluctant to resume the organization’s $1 million tree planting and community training initiative along the 7-mile Woonaquatucket Greenway, even though federal funds were unfrozen earlier this week.
“Right now, we’re not going ahead with anything major because we don’t know what we will have long-term,” Lehrer said, speaking outside the hearing. “This is a major, major project with a lot of planning and a lot of community partners. We have people we can’t let down.”
Lehrer was reluctant to comment on the courtroom hearing she had just watched play out. But, she acknowledged a feeling of disconnection between the legal battle and what she and other nonprofit leaders are facing in their daily lives.
Brion agreed.
“This is about childhood lead poisoning, which we know is preventable,” she said. “We have a signed grant award. There’s no reason we shouldn’t be able to do this.”
While Brion’s organization was not yet contemplating layoffs, a more imminent danger for other nonprofits named in the case, it was not out of the question.
“At this point, nothing is certain,” she said.
Lawyers for the nonprofits have asked McElroy to order federal agencies to release and resume any grant funding awarded based on Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act spending, not only for the plaintiffs in the case but for any grant recipients awarded money via the Biden administration spending packages.
McElroy did not indicate Thursday when she would issue an order, though she noted it would not be this week. Thursday afternoon she was scheduled to preside over a virtual hearing in another federal court case challenging the cutoff of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants.

You’ll also find a passionate, hard-working staff of caregivers who work too hard for too little compensation and yet strive to provide high-quality care. 
The Washington state Senate has put forward a budget that increases funding for nursing homes, recognizing the need to invest in the caregivers who dedicate themselves to caring for our residents in need. However, the state House proposal cuts funding for nursing homes by delaying rate increases until 2028, which would devastate our workforce and ability to offer high-quality long-term care.
As an SEIU 775 represented certified nursing assistant and a chief executive officer working in Washington nursing homes, we are deeply concerned about the sustainability of this essential model of long-term care in our state. Families and communities across Washington simply cannot afford to do more with less after years of crisis and inadequate state investments.
Nursing homes are a critical component of our state’s rehabilitation and long-term health care systems. While some of our residents come to us for a short-term stay following surgery or cancer treatment, many more are residents who live with us full-time and receive round-the-clock care. 
Sixty-two percent of Washington’s nursing home patients are low-income and rely on Medicaid to access care, and Medicaid reimbursement rates are set by the state Legislature. Although our sector faces a significant increase in patients needing care over the next five years, we are plagued by chronic underfunding and a workforce crisis as a result. One-time funding patches are not the solution. 
Rising costs affect everyone, but in health care systems like ours, we are unable to respond to our staff’s need for higher wages or to increased food prices for residents’ meals without the Legislature taking action. 
Administrators and nursing staff alike are cost-conscious — we’re not serving steak and lobster every night for dinner, nor are we asking for unnecessary supplies. High-quality care comes first. Without adequate staffing or equipment, it becomes tremendously difficult just to ensure we are keeping up with the basics. However, the reality is that when we show up to work, we still do our best to care for our patients, and it ends up being our own bodies and our own families that feel the cost.
Today, Medicaid funding is insufficient and outdated because it is based on how costs were measured in 2022. This means that nursing homes struggle to offer competitive wages and benefits after years of record inflation. Following the release of budget proposals from lawmakers, it’s clear that the Senate is clear-eyed about this reality and the House has yet to recognize how devastating cuts would be to our long-term care workforce and system.  We cannot delay increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates any longer than we already have. If we want to offer high-quality health care to our residents — and avoid a long-term care crisis — the Legislature must invest in caregivers.
For those who do not know someone who works in long-term care, this is not a job for the faint of heart or the dispassionate. Our colleagues are among the most dedicated and kindhearted people we know. Most of us could make more money or find better benefits at different jobs that require less demanding work. But we are still here because we love our jobs and we love our patients. 
During the pandemic, we all learned the term “essential worker”, and it includes long-term care professionals like our colleagues. Pandemic or not, our patients need us. 
Legislators have hard budget decisions before them. But they could help long-term care workers and the people they care for by adopting a funding approach that keeps up with real-world costs and does not rely on one-time investments.
They could also help by making affordable health care available to the 18,000 essential workers in the sector.
While numbers and budget items get moved around, human lives and human dignity are at stake. Difficult times call for difficult decisions, and we hope that protecting funding for those who rely on skilled nursing — whether for care or employment — can be more than a talking point in Olympia.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/long-term-care-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 17:05:57.136078

(Screenshot from Florida Channel) The Republican controlled Florida House of Representatives has passed a measure that will make it prohibitively harder for a citizen-led constitutional amendment to get on the ballot. The vote was for 76-31.
Its passage comes just four months after two constitutional amendments that would have respectively enshrined abortion rights and legalized recreational cannabis for adults narrowly fell short of passage.
  Jenna Persons-Mulicka via Florida House
The bill (HB 1205), sponsored by Lee County Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka, includes a number of provisions that Democrats and voting-rights advocates say could essentially kill most attempts to place citizen-led constitutional amendments on future ballots.
At the heart of the argument by advocates is the need to prevent fraud. The Office of Election Crimes and Security published a report in January asserting that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions.
And last week the Office of Election Crimes and Security informed Smart & Safe Florida, the group working to get a constitutional amendment regarding the adult use of cannabis on the 2026 ballot, that the Division of Elections was fining them $121,850 for allegedly submitting petitions more than 30 days after voters signed them — a violation of existing law.
“We have seen widespread and rampant fraud in this state and in this process,” said Persons-Mulicka. “We have evidence that we cannot take a blind eye to. We must take further action to put integrity back into the initiative process.”
The changes
Among the most contentious provisions is a requirement that the state Office of Elections Crimes and Security investigate if more than 10% of submitted petitions during any reporting period are deemed invalid.
The requirement amounts to a 90% validity rate, which Democrats say is impossible to overcome.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani offered an amendment to reduce the percentage of submitted petitions deemed invalid to trigger an investigation to a 60% validity rate. It was struck down.
Other provisions include:

Requiring the petition sponsor to post a $1 million bond payable to the Division of Elections once the sponsor has obtained a letter from the department confirming that 25% of the requisite number of signatures has been obtained.
If a person who is collecting or handling initiatives petitions is found to not be a U.S. citizen or has been convicted of a felony without having his right to vote restored, the petition sponsor is liable for a $50,000 fine for each person.
The bill revises the deadline by which petitions must be delivered by the sponsor to a supervisor of elections from 30 days to 10 days and increases the fines from a $50 flat fee for each late petition form to $50 for each day late for a total fine of up to $2,500 per late petition form. If the sponsor or petition circulator acted “willfully,” the bill increases the penalty from $250 for each petition form to $2,500.
The bill requires all petition circulators — volunteers as well as paid staffers — to be residents of Florida. It says that before a paid petition circulator is registered, he or she must submit to a criminal background check to be paid for by the applicant or petition sponsor.
Removes  the coordinator of the Office of Economic and Demographic Research from the Financial Impact Estimating Conference, which prepares financial impact statements to accompany any proposed constitutional amendment. (The sitting  coordinator of the office, Florida chief economist Amy Baker, is the only member of the Financial Impact Estimating Conference not directly appointed by a Republican politician).

To get a proposed amendment by initiative on the general election ballot, currently a petition must be signed by 891,589 voters and the signatures must come from at least half of Florida’s 28 congressional districts. To pass, it must win 60% support from the voters.
Voters silenced?
During debate on the House floor, Broward County Democratic Rep. Robin Bartleman argued it would be unfair to make an onerous process even harder to accomplish.

“You are shutting out our fellow Floridians,” she said. “If we really are about the free state of Florida — which is we always like to say we are — then it’s our duty that the power remains in the hands of the people. Every hurdle that you are putting up here today takes it out of their hands. Our citizen-led constitutional amendment provision is already the strictest in the country.”
Before the floor debate, voting rights groups held a news conference in the Fourth Floor rotunda of the Capitol, where they blasted the bill as “undemocratic.”
“They are trying to silence us,” said Amy Keith with Common Cause Florida. “They are trying to make it impossible for everyday Floridians to put citizen-led amendments on the ballot. They don’t want us to be able to directly pass policies that we know our communities need. They think that they have the right to silence us but we are here to say, ‘No.’”
“Why are the legislators afraid of the average citizen talking to their neighbor?” said Cecile Scoon, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Florida.
 “Who are the legislators listening to? It appears when you look at these bills to limit citizen’s constitutional amendment process, they’re listening to big companies, they’re making it so that only big money can use the citizen process, which is supposed to be for the everyday person.”

(Getty Images) Veterinary experts nationwide have a variety of hypotheses for new and puzzling test results from cow milk being analyzed for avian influenza — including in New Mexico.
March marked one year since officials first reported Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza — H5N1 — among dairy cattle. Since then, bird flu has infected 996 herds across the country, including 19 cases in the last month in California and Idaho.
New Mexico reported nine dairy herds in Curry County tested positive last April, and began milk testing its cattle in February following the rollout of a federal program.
The most recent results from milk-testing programs revealed that while more than 95% of the 93 cow herds in the state tested negative, a small set of inconsistent positives — all from three Curry County herds infected last year — remain, according to New Mexico State Veterinarian Samantha Holeck.
Enter the mystery: The cows themselves do not test positive, nor do they demonstrate the symptoms documented in the earlier avian flu outbreak, she said, such as huge drops in milk production.
“It’s been a real challenge to try to understand how it continues to circulate in some of these herds,” Holeck said.
New Mexico is partnering up with veterinarians in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research the viral fragments found in the milk and sent samples to the federal National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.
“I know we’re a year into this situation now,” Holeck said, “but it seems like there’s still just so much to try to understand.”
New Mexico isn’t alone in experiencing the viral fragments, said Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian at University of California, Davis, who noted there have been reports of similar persistent positives in quarantined herds there.
“I wouldn’t diminish the importance of it being small,” Payne said. “Yes, we’re talking about low levels of virus and yes, we’re talking about cows not getting sick, but it’s important that we’re not exactly sure where it’s coming from, and that in and of itself merits examination.”
He said more than $2 million dollars of research is being conducted in California on avian flu transmission across a dozen projects; including examining if it’s transmitted by flies; blowing in from dust storms; or carried by birds outside of waterfowl.
“It will be critical that we figure out how the disease is moving and how it’s changing,” Payne said.
‘Science is still very much in its infancy’
While scientists need to perform more research, Payne posited some possibilities for the detection of viral fragments: they could signify a different and less potent version of the virus; cooler weather might allow more viral fragments to survive in the bulk tanks, compared to the triple-digit temperatures in the fall; cows may have developed “herd immunity” against the virus.
“It could be that much smaller numbers of cattle are being exposed and are becoming infected, which has resulted in a much, much lower level of virus that’s being detected inside the bulk tanks,” Payne said. “It’s an area of active research.”
Veterinarian Andrew Bowman, a molecular epidemiologist at Ohio State University, said laboratory tests’ sensitivity could also be a factor: They may be picking up positives from environmental contamination in the tanks or on the farms.
“It doesn’t take much; we’re talking a few copies of the viral genome to be present in a sample to send it positive,” Bowman said. “We can pick up a positive that’s likely not a viable virus.”
Since the development of HPAI in cows is so new, as is the method of transmission — where the virus replicates in the mammary glands that produce milk — he said the basic questions of the interactions between the virus, the host and the environment still need answers.
“Science is still very much in the infancy of what we know about avian influenza in cattle,” Bowman said.
Offering reassurances
While scientists say it’s important to unravel the mystery of the viral fragments to better understand how the virus might change or spread in dairy cows, they also emphasize that risk to the public from avian influenza remains low.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports transmission of avian flu can occur from contact with milk from infected cows; eating, drinking or inhaling droplets contaminated with live virus; touching the live or dead bodies of infected animals. Thus far, the CDC has no documented human-to-human transmission. As of April 1, 70 people had contracted H5N1, mostly California farmworkers.
Most milk sold in the U.S. is heated to a temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, called pasteurization. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested milk products in 17 states and, finding no live viruses, reported that “pasteurization is effective at inactivating H5N1, and that the commercial, pasteurized milk supply is safe.”
Federal officials, however, warn that unpasteurized milk, also called raw milk, is unsafe to drink. Research from the National Institutes of Health in June using infected raw milk from New Mexico found that the H5N1 virus had survived for at least five weeks in refrigerated conditions. Further, mice that consumed the raw milk showed signs of illness, which  researchers suggest indicates drinking raw milk can transmit the virus to other organisms.
Holeck emphasized that New Mexico milk is safe.
“For dairies, it’s standard routine if they have sick cows for any reason, not just [avian flu], that milk is always diverted out from the milk supply, it doesn’t enter commerce,” she said.

(Legislative stream screengrab)The Nevada Department of Corrections is racking up $60 million in overtime a year because of the need to shift correction officers from one post to another to address staffing shortages, resulting in a $50 million dollar budgeting shortfall that took lawmakers by surprise during a hearing Thursday of the Interim Finance Committee. 
NDOC Director James Dzurenda told lawmakers he was instructed by the Governor’s Finance Office last year that the department’s personnel shortage could not be addressed until a staffing study initiated in 2024 is completed in June. 
Dzurenda testified the department is “usually about $60 million short on day one” of a biennium because of overtime demands. He predicted the study will “be devastating” and reveal a biennial shortfall of “over $100 million.” 
“So you’re saying that your agency told the governor’s office… ‘hey, we’re going to run into huge deficits. We’re going to overspend like nobody’s business in overtime,’ and they were aware of this, and they just didn’t bring it to our attention until March?” an incredulous Sen. Rochelle Nguyen asked Dzurenda. 
“I don’t know when they brought it to your attention, but these discussions have been happening since I got here in ‘23,” Dzurenda responded. “We knew we were going to be short, and I’m telling you, we’re going to be short next time, too.”
Lombardo did not respond to a request for comment. The governor, when asked about economic concerns in recent months, has repeatedly referred to “triaging” the state through any fiscal storm. 
Triaging in the state prison department amounts to reducing visitation and shifting in-person educational programming to correspondence courses. 
The overtime problem, Dzurenda said, “is complicated” and involves a number of variables, such as delays in obtaining a staffing study to substantiate the need for additional positions; unbudgeted costs such as transporting prisoners; staffing NDOC’s training academy; and the cost of overtime provisions included in a collective bargaining agreement negotiated in 2023 for correction officers. 
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro told Dzurenda if he was aware of a “regular, ongoing use of overtime monies,” a request should have been made for “a reserve of X amount of dollars that we believe we are going to have to pay overtime.” 
Instead, she argued Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s administration “turned a blind eye to it,” leaving lawmakers “halfway through a legislative session, to figure out how to fill that hole.”
One corrections officer has racked up 1,600 hours of overtime since the fiscal year began, “which puts you on track to work 80-hour weeks,” Nguyen said, adding she was “incredibly disappointed” and branded the episode “a failure on so many levels.”  
NDOC’s current solution, she added, cuts the education programs that “from what we’ve heard from you, Director, over and over and over again, actually make those prisons safer for your correction officers and safer for the people that are incarcerated in there. Is that my understanding?”
“Yes,” Dzurenda replied. 
Democratic Sen. Danielle Monroe Moreno, a former corrections officer, voiced a “need to apologize” to Dzurenda, adding she didn’t know if the governor or the Legislature had put him in a situation that “is not winnable.”
“We have a responsibility to make sure that you get what you need for your staff to be safe and the inmates in our charge to be safe,” she said, and directed NDOC to seek additional funding during the legislative interim. 
In other IFC developments, Monroe Moreno warned agencies with projects funded by American Rescue Plan funds, which will revert to the federal government if not spent by the end of next year, that because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, increasing costs of construction and goods could jeopardize their timely completion.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-3-25-at-12.53-PM-1024x775.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 16:04:16.203427

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota public university tuition will increase after remaining flat for the last three years.
The Board of Regents, which oversees the university system, approved a system-wide average 2.9% undergraduate tuition increase during its Thursday meeting at Northern State University in Aberdeen. Tuition will rise by roughly that amount at five of the state’s universities, while South Dakota Mines in Rapid City will increase its tuition by 4.5% “to align the institution” with peer universities, the Regents said in a news release, and to help support the university’s “special focus” on engineering, science and technology.
Regents director: Dearth of need-based aid dings South Dakota’s college affordability

The board also approved a $1 per credit hour increase in the mandatory general activity fee, which supports student activities and campus amenities, along with increases to housing and meal plan rates and other specialized or campus-specific fee increases. 
The total annual undergraduate cost for South Dakota students will increase by $520.15 next year to an average of $18,939.92, according to the board.
Inflation and legislative decisions in a tight budget year contributed to the increase, and tough budget years will continue, said Board of Regents Executive Director Nathan Lukkes. 
“We certainly don’t want to get into a place where we’re going too cheap, if you will,” Lukkes said, “and start to sacrifice quality for our students.”
‘Conservative’ increase helps cover ‘minimum’ cost increases
Competition with regional institutions largely drove tuition freezes approved by the Regents and funded by the Legislature in the last three years. South Dakota had the lowest tuition and fees for an undergraduate resident and non-resident degree compared to surrounding states in the last two school years.
Regents last approved a tuition increase of 1.1% in fiscal year 2021.


While the Legislature provided funding for tuition freezes prior to this year, that funding did not support a fee freeze, which the system chose to do anyway. The Legislature’s annual mandated increases in employee salaries did not come with extra funding either, said Heather Forney, vice president of finance and administration for the system. Universities absorbed the costs.
“In an era where our neighboring states are increasing tuition by double digits, we’ve really held the line,” Forney said.
The increases will help address “astronomical” inflation and insurance costs universities ate during the tuition freeze era, Forney added. For example, some building insurance costs rose 450% in the last five years.
The system couldn’t avoid increasing fees and tuition forever, said board member Pam Roberts. She called the proposal a “conservative” increase.
Board President Tim Rave agreed.
“I think the 2.9% really reflects, maybe in some aspects, the minimum,” Rave said. “It’s really not covering all the costs that the universities are exposed to.”
Softened legislative cuts remain an ‘ongoing concern’
The Legislature’s recent $2 million cut to the regental budget will lead to “tough financial decisions” for universities, according to a South Dakota Board of Regents press release Thursday.
“After many years of strong legislative support, these reductions may threaten key programs, support services, and physical infrastructure,” the release said, “potentially impacting the state’s long-term workforce development and economic growth.”
Lawmakers also upheld a price increase for South Dakota high school students taking dual-credit college classes, but defeated a proposed funding reduction for the state’s medical residency program. Legislators used one-time funding to avoid a proposed $9.1 million building maintenance and repair cut. That will “kick the can down the road,” Lukkes told board members.
“That certainly remains an ongoing concern,” Lukkes said, “in terms of how we make sure that we have access to the resources necessary to maintain our facilities and provide a top quality experience to our students without simply passing the cost along to students.”

This session, lawmakers are taking up bills that could impact the high-tech industry in Montana for years to come, from ones that ease oversight and taxes for data centers to another that would help legislators grasp complex new technology on the landscape.
Data centers are the digital infrastructure backbone for many advancements, including blockchain technology, but use significant amounts of energy.
House Bill 877, brought by Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, is called the Montana Data Center Development Act, and seeks to block the Public Service Commission from preventing a utility from serving large customers in a way the agency itself opposes. 
“It strips away PSC oversight. It’s a deregulation bill,” said PSC President Brad Molnar, in the House Energy, Technology and Government Relations Committee. “Call it what you want to, it’s a deregulation bill.”
Proponents included NorthWestern Energy, which argued it would be able to produce enough electricity to meet new demands.
Senate Bill 330, brought by Sen. Gayle Lammers, R-Hardin, seeks to build legislative capacity for understanding blockchain and digital innovation as well as seeks inroads with companies engaged in blockchain and digital finance. It was sent to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk on an 81-18 margin on Monday afternoon.
“It really is going to be a big educational bill, and that’s what’s neat about it,” Lammers said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “And it kind of solves the problem that everybody has with it. They say, ‘Oh, I just don’t understand, and I don’t know,’ and that’s why I brought this bill.”
Two other bills seeing movement also touch on the business, technology and power. 
House Bill 424, brought by Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, seeks to revise taxes for Class 17 properties, which include data centers. 
Meanwhile, Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, has brought Senate Bill 265, which seeks to revise cryptocurrency laws in the state. It would affect so-called “network tokens” and would formally regulate businesses using blockchain technology. Network tokens are used in payments as an alternative to a payment card number.
 The energy question

Underneath all the technology bills is an underlying question as to whether Montana has the energy capacity to serve both its residential and industrial customers.
Cold is a major worry — there’s a lot of demand for energy when winter hits, and “brownouts,” when there’s a reduction of power in a specific area, are a major concern for some in the Legislature.
NorthWestern customers recently had to pay an extra $39 million following a cold snap because the utility had to buy power on the market.
“We need to make sure that the power that’s going to satisfy these larger loads doesn’t become a critical and potentially problematic factor when we’re at 20 below zero, and we’ve already experienced that,” Sen. Chris Pope, D-Bozeman, told the Daily Montanan.
In December 2024, NorthWestern Energy announced an expectation to serve “up to” 450 MW of power to data centers, according to Jo Dee Black, a spokesperson for the company, in an email to the Daily Montanan. Black added the utility owns 1,065 MW of production capacity, but it “would be wrong to state that all that generation, or all generation from an owned-generation resource, would serve a single class of customers.”
NorthWestern is also adding to its capacity, both at the coal-fired plant in Colstrip, and its new methane-fired plant in Laurel. But Molnar said data center businesses will put permanent pressure on energy providers.
“Data centers, they don’t scale up or down,” Molnar said. “They are a constant run of their computers storing and generating data. They do not ramp up and down based on how much electricity is available.”
At one point, NorthWestern was producing about 1,600 MW of electricity. Peak demand in 2023, according to the utility, was about 2,000 MW.
During the hearing for Fitzpatrick’s bill, Alan Olson, who was lobbying for NorthWestern, was asked if the utility could provide enough base load energy to meet customer demands.
“Today, we are short,” Olson said to the committee.
This session has seen a push to bring nuclear power to Montana, cited by tech companies as a way to ramp up domestic power production. 
Fitzpatrick’s bill brought the need for more production — and whether or not the utility can serve all of its customers — to the forefront. NorthWestern believes it will have enough generation capacity to follow through on the commitments it makes to businesses drawing large amounts of power, such as data centers.
“Recently, the PSC seems to have developed a novel interpretation of the law, which suggests that they get to decide whether or not Northwestern can serve a new industrial load,” Fitzpatrick said on Monday in House Energy. “This bill simply says no, it’s not within the purview of the PSC authority to tell NorthWestern who it cannot serve as long as the proposed new customers can demonstrate that the services received does not harm existing customers.”
The bill says the PSC’s “role does not extend to prohibiting large electric customers from obtaining service from certain public utilities.” Fitzpatrick is a former NorthWestern lobbyist. 
There’s been frustration from some Democrats with NorthWestern as well.
“Northwestern Energy says, ‘Oh, we can absolutely provide this energy,’” Minority Leader Katie Sullivan said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “And at the same time, they come to us and say, ‘We have an energy crisis, and we can’t supply energy to homes anymore.’”
Currency mining is one the purposes of data centers, an industry some legislators want to grow in Montana.
Currency mining, or proofing, is an energy-intensive process that essentially involves a computer solving complex math problems. The more computers and larger the system, the faster it can process those problems, and miners can receive cryptocurrency as a reward for doing so.
In 2022, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported cryptocurrency mining “probably represents from 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.”
To put it in perspective, one estimate out of Columbia University’s Climate School had cryptocurrency worldwide uses as much electricity as the country of Argentina. 
More computers means more energy consumption. This was at the heart of disputes in Missoula County several years ago, which eventually led the county to develop zoning regulations for cryptocurrency.
Essentially, the county forced mining companies to source clean power for their operations. A bill in 2023 — SB 178, brought by Sen. Zolnikov — took away a municipality’s ability to pass certain laws regarding cryptocurrency mining. 
 Task Force Blockchain

While energy usage is an important discussion point on data centers and new technology, Montana’s economy is too.
As Bozeman continues to develop as a tech hub and Montana remains an attractive place to live, legislators say some foresight will likely be needed to guide future laws.
Lammers’ bill, SB 330, will do just that.
A new task force created by his bill will be made up of a handful of legislators as well appointees of the governor, Senate and House leadership. The Attorney General’s office and State Auditor will also have representatives on the task force.
Their goal will be to provide recommendations that will shape future laws, as well as to attract businesses to the state. The businesses aim to bring include energy-intensive data centers, a focus this session, but a major debate across the state for about a decade.
Lammers’ bill specifically deals with blockchain technology. The blockchain is a type of ledger that records information transferred between entities.
Cryptocurrency — a decentralized, digital currency — has been most commonly associated with blockchain, but it’s not the only application. Advocates, including Lammers, point to potential in medical records, uses in agriculture, and tracking supply chains. 
Proponents of the technology, including IBM, say it’s more secure  — it’s stored on a network rather than on one server — and reduces the risk of fraud as blockchain records cannot be altered. Medical records, for example, are either stored electronically or as physical copies. The idea is technology like blockchain can make accessing records easier and quicker. Additionally, blockchain technology does not require a third-party to approve a transaction, keeping things between two entities.
The bill was heard in the House Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee on March 19 and had several proponents, including the Montana Bankers Association and the Satoshi Action Fund, a nonprofit dedicated to advocating for Bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency. 
“We believe that Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining have the potential to positively impact our environment, our grid, our economy, and society as a whole,” the Satoshi Action Fund states on its website.
However, a 2023 United Nations study pointed to serious environmental concerns with Bitcoin, which it said is highly dependent on fossil fuels.
 Reputation problems

Not all of the pushback against blockchain technology and the data centers needed to run them involve energy. 
A controversy in Butte over CryptoWatt, a cryptomining company, involved a majority owner who was indicted in a $722 million Ponzi scheme.
Some legislators are wondering if this new technology has staying power or is the right industry for Montana to embrace.
“I think a lot of the problems with the reputation of cryptocurrency now was it was oversold and became a pretty easy Ponzi scheme to get into and scam, you know, pump and dump,” Rep. Kelly Kortum, D-Bozeman, said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “There are legitimate uses of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin, but it’s been so abused by so many bad actors that they’ve lost a lot of credibility on their practical, real world uses.”
Legislators also discussed the makeup of the task force, a minor controversy. There’s also the question of what type of businesses Montana wants, an idea that doesn’t exactly hold to partisan lines.
For example, Senate President Matt Reiger, R-Kalispell, said he likes small businesses in Montana and “the rural feel.”
“You can make great money just being in the trades,” Reiger said during a media presser. “You don’t need a tech job. You probably make more being a plumber, honestly.”
 New regulations

Senate Bill 265, brought by Sen. Zolnikov and co-sponsored by Rep. Zolnikov, a married couple, has yet to hit the House floor, but had a hearing in the House Energy, Technology and Government Relations Committee the same day Lammers’ SB 330 was heard there.
The legislation is regulatory in nature, Sen. Zolnikov said during the hearing.
“We’re trying to attract these very on-the-leading-edge technology companies to our state and give them a framework in which they can live and play within without worrying about being thrown out or breaking a law they didn’t know they’re breaking,” Zolnikov said.
The legislation would also make it law that a governing authority can’t disallow a business from taking digital assets or currency as a form of payment. It also formally allows the operation of businesses either using or developing software for blockchain operations.
There’s also a securities exemption, which Zolnikov said would clear up ambiguities in the law. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires, “Every offer and sale of securities must either be registered under the Securities Act of 1933” or have an exemption.
“This bill, with the help of the auditor’s office and other individuals, creates a clear pathway for entities who want to be in America, who are legitimate.”
To be sure these companies don’t get bogged down with federal U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, the bill also offers an exemption, which Sen. Zolnikov said would clear up ambiguities about whether they need to register.
House Bill 424, brought by Rep. Zolnikov, seeks to make the business climate more friendly and stable for businesses utilizing data centers. The bill does this by creating incentives for on-site energy production at data centers and extending the timeframe in which those businesses can be built. 
Some regulations surrounding the data centers sunset in 2027, she said during a floor debate on March 24.
That bill included an amendment from Rep. Fitzpatrick dealing with the price of power and taxation. Data centers would only be able to sell excess power for cost of production, in an effort to prevent price gouging during electrical emergencies. The amendment also revises the tax rate on power production, putting it in class 13 — the power plant class — after a period of 10 years.
The property tax rate for data centers is 0.9%, while power plants pay a 6% property tax rate. Power generation facilities at data centers would slowly have their rate increased over time, treating it as an introductory rate. Lastly, the amendment would also not exempt data centers from paying into tax increment financing districts.
“Class 17 property regarding data centers currently exist in state law,” Rep. Zolnikov said during a floor session on March 24. “What we’re doing in this bill is we’re expanding this class to include power generation behind the meter, and this is what’s key to supporting grid resiliency and benefiting Montana in times of electrical emergencies.”



 Blockchain Task Force

Some representatives took issue with who would be on the task force created by SB 330.
The amendments made some people feel more at ease with the legislation, Lammers said. The amendments put six legislators on the task force, as well as the state auditor and attorney general or their designees. 
The governor also gets to pick five people to put on the task force and those individuals who would need to have experience with blockchain, cryptocurrency, financial technology or digital innovation technology.
The majority leaders in both the House and Senate also get to pick four other members each who do not have to be in the legislature. Minority leaders in both chambers get to pick one representative each.
“I’m worried that some of the members selected could not necessarily be experts, but be marketing experts,” Kortum said. “And that’s something we’re seeing nationwide.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1353360317-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 16:04:16.203427

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Legislation moving through the Rhode Island House and Senate could alleviate one pain point for parents: Filling a prescription for ADHD medications amid ongoing shortages.
On Tuesday, the Rhode Island House Committee on Health and Human Services OK’d an amended version of H5866, a bill led by Portsmouth Democratic Rep. Michelle McGaw that would improve patients’ access to prescription stimulants by allowing pharmacies to fill and dispense a 60-day supply rather than in 30-day increments as is currently allowed. The drugs are mainly used to treat ADHD and ADD, hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders, and since 2022 have consistently faced shortages nationwide.
The bill’s Senate duplicate — introduced by Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat — was also heard in committee on Tuesday. It was held for further study, which is standard practice at a bill’s initial hearing, but at least one of DiMario’s colleagues on the Senate Committee on Health was supportive.
“As someone who has to do this, yes, it’s very angst provoking for the provider and for the patient,” said Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barringon Democrat and primary care nurse practitioner. 
DiMario’s bill would permit a more plentiful prescription by allowing pharmacies to issue a 90-day supply in a single filling. The original version of McGaw’s bill also endorsed a 90-day supply before being amended on March 28 ahead of its second committee hearing. The house’s legal counsel said at Tuesday’s hearing that there had been comments from physicians which spurred the change but did not provide details. 
DiMario wrote via text message Thursday that for now, her Senate bill will retain the 90-day stipulation.
“We just had the hearing so the [Committee] Chair will review all the testimony and decide how to proceed,” DiMario wrote, “but to my knowledge there isn’t a compelling reason to shorten the timeline to 60 days given those prescriptions can be written 90 days at a time in three separate prescriptions already.”
DiMario and McGaw’s bills are written to permit larger prescriptions for “non-opioid, non-narcotic Schedule II substances.” Schedule II drugs can be very habit-forming, but have at least some specific clinical applications, including prescription stimulants like mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), Ritalin and Vyvanse, which are used to treat ADHD and ADD.
Since 2007, the Drug Enforcement Administration has allowed doctors to write prescriptions for 90 days’ worth of Schedule II medications. But these 90-day prescriptions cannot be picked up all at once, and they can’t be sent to a pharmacy at the same time. A physician must write three separate prescriptions, three months in a row. The patient will then see their doctor for another round of prescriptions, and the cycle begins anew. Multiple prescriptions may also be written for different strengths, to divvy up a larger dose and get around shortages.

No-brainer or bad idea? 
DiMario also sponsored a successful bill signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee last year that prepares state health officials to adopt a 2023 federal standard that allows for electronic transfers of ADHD prescriptions — another common obstacle for patients and doctors alike, as federal prescription regulations plus continued shortages frequently complicate accessibility for patients.
Dr. Gregory Fox, a pediatrician speaking on behalf of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told senators Tuesday the bill was a “no-brainer” from a physician’s perspective as well. 
“I sat down with my two nurses today and they told me, when they arrived this morning, there were 20 refills for ADD prescriptions waiting for them, and then many, many, many come on through the day,” Fox said, estimating that his office nurses spend “at least three or four hours of administrative time per day on ADHD prescriptions,” which DiMario’s bill would slash by a third. 
Supportive testimonies for the legislation for DiMario’s bill and McGaw’s original draft came from the Rhode Island Pharmacists Association as well.
Dr. Howard Schulman, an internist and primary care doctor based in East Providence who said he often tried to bring a “from the trenches” perspective on health care to lawmakers in his public testimonies, was the lone person to submit a letter Tuesday against the bill.
In a phone call Wednesday, Schulman noted he was more comfortable with the 60-day rule over the 90-day proposal. He emphasized that he understands the motivation for the legislation, and has empathy for the lawmakers who expressed frustration at having to refill their kids’ medicine over and over.  
“This bill, if we pass it, is going to make my life better,” said Rep. Jennifer Boylan, a Barrington Democrat, at the initial March 18 hearing of McGaw’s bill. “I’m one of the parents that is going to the pharmacy three times a month. They cannot synchronize the prescriptions. I’m calling the doctor for three different prescriptions every single month. It’s ridiculous.”
But Schulman was not convinced it was wise to increase a patient’s supply of drugs that can become more habit-forming with higher doses, especially when the drugs are often shared among young people.
“​​I’m always trying to minimize the amount,” said Schulman of the stimulant prescriptions he’s been writing for 15 years in his practice. “There’s a fair number of people who are on it, [but] I’m not giving it out like candy.” 
Schulman prescribes at most 60 milligrams once a day — half the amount some patients say they’re taking when they arrive at his office from other prescribers. Schulman also asks his patients to read “Generation Adderall,” a 2016 New York Times article that detailed one woman’s account of dependence and eventual cessation from the popular amphetamine.
Asked if filling even larger prescriptions for the drugs could exacerbate existing shortages, Schulman chuckled but didn’t speculate. He said his concern was with lawmakers who aren’t doctors “regulating something that could affect people getting addicted to it.” 
Schulman said he hoped the Rhode Island Department of Health would have something to say about the bill. But the state health department “has no position on this bill,” Joseph Wendelken, an agency spokesperson, wrote via email Wednesday.
The House bill will now go to a floor vote, likely the week of April 21, said House spokesperson Larry Berman in an email Thursday.

(Photo via Getty Images)Starting on June 20, a new state law may help workers in New Mexico who are hurt on the job have an easier time finding a lawyer to handle their workers’ compensation claims.
State law previously capped the fees an attorney could collect for representing a worker making an accidental injury claim at $22,500.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on March 21 signed into law House Bill 66, which raised the cap on attorney’s fees in workers’ compensation cases to $30,000, and will raise it again to $32,000 in 2027, and then $34,000 in 2029.
Ben Sherman, a workers’ compensation attorney and an expert witness on HB66, told the House Labor, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee on Jan. 28 that many workers don’t have attorneys and litigate their cases on their own.
Sherman said there is a “huge shortage” of lawyers practicing workers’ compensation in New Mexico, especially in rural areas.
“It can be almost impossible — if you’re not in Albuquerque or Santa Fe — to find an attorney to represent you if you’re injured on the job,” he said.
The new law also allows insurance companies to advance a greater share of the injured worker’s legal costs for discovery, which is the process of gathering evidence in a case and could include testimony from the doctor who treated the injured worker.
Previously, the law capped this advance at $3,000. Workers only get the money back if they win, Sherman said.
HB66 increased the discovery cost advances to $3,500 and will raise it again to $4,000 in 2027, and then $4,500 in 2029.
Workers’ Compensation Administration rules allow doctors and other health care providers to charge up to $400 for the first hour of being deposed; up to $360 per hour for the second and subsequent hours; up to $200 per hour for the first hour of preparing to be deposed and up to $120 per hour for the second hour of preparation and subsequent hours.
Sherman told the committee there is a shortage of doctors in New Mexico who want to treat injured workers in part because they “are not paid commensurate with doctors who do private insurance or are paid in other ways to treat workers.”
He said some pending rules from the WCA would increase how much doctors can charge for their time preparing for and participating in depositions.
Stephanie Welch, workers’ rights director with the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, told the committee that her organization supported the bill because workers’ compensation offers a vital safety net that protects workers from the economic hardships created by medical bills and lost wages after they experience a workplace injury.
Welch said many workers who suffer workplace injuries, and who paid into the workers’ compensation system, never obtain the benefits in part because of the lack of incentive for private attorneys to take their cases.
“This bill helps level the playing field between workers and employers, and offsets some of the advantage that employers often have because they have more financial resources,” Welch said. “This bill is good for New Mexico’s workers and ensures a more equitable workers compensation system.”
Lawmakers in 2023 asked the state Workers’ Compensation Administration to create a task force to study attorney’s fee caps.
Rep. Pamelya Herndon (D-Albuquerque) sponsored HB66 and the 2023 memorial that created the task force. Source NM left a voicemail for Herndon on Thursday seeking comment on the bill’s enactment but had not heard back as of publication time.
Sherman, a member of the New Mexico Trial Lawyers Association and of the task force, told the committee that lawmakers last set the attorney fee cap at $22,500 in 2013. He said if the cap had followed inflation, it would be $32,750 today.
The new law also directs the Advisory Council on Workers’ Compensation and Occupational Disease Disablement to review the caps and make recommendations to the Legislature in 2029.

In order to ensure [&#8230;]","Planned Parenthood clinic in Marquette, the only abortion care clinic in the U.P., on Dec. 9, 2021 | Allison R. DonahuePlanned Parenthood of Michigan announced Wednesday that it will be closing its health centers in Jackson, Petoskey and Marquette at the end of the month and consolidating the two health centers in Ann Arbor into one location after the Trump administration cut millions of dollars in federal funding for family planning.
In order to ensure long-term sustainability amid funding cuts and expected future restrictions on reproductive health care enacted by President Donald Trump’s administration, Planned Parenthood of Michigan, or PPMI said in a news release that it is eliminating some clinics and cutting its staffing by 10 percent.
“Our decision to restructure reflects months of strategic planning and careful financial analysis,” Paula Thornton Greear, President and CEO of PPMI said in a news release. “These necessary changes strengthen PPMI’s ability to adapt quickly in a challenging political landscape. While implementing difficult decisions is never easy, they are essential to protect our long-term capacity to fulfill our mission and serve Michigan communities for generations to come.” 
Trump himself for years has articulated his interest in defunding Planned Parenthood for providing abortion care, and the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS announced this week that it is placing a freeze on millions of dollars to a federal program dedicated to family planning for low-income patients known as Title X.
Nine Planned Parenthood state affiliates that receive federal money from the 55-year-old Title X family planning program got notices Monday, informing them that their funding is being “temporarily withheld.” The notice pointed to “possible violations” of federal civil rights law and President Donald Trump’s executive orders — including prohibitions on promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion and “taxpayer subsidization of open borders.”
Whitmer orders state departments to review Trump executive orders on DEI, transgender policies

The cut comes as a devastating blow to health care providers like PPMI, Thornton Greear said in the news release. And though PPMI plans on expanding hours for its Virtual Health Center for telehealth services like birth control, medicated abortions and gender affirming health care, the current administration’s attitude towards reproductive health care has PPMI preparing for further challenges.
“And in the coming weeks and months, additional attacks against sexual and reproductive health care providers are expected, including restricting access to medication abortion, restricting Medicaid coverage of Planned Parenthood health services, further restrictions on Title X funding, or even ending the program altogether, as the administration has already done to so many other lifesaving Federal funding streams and agencies,” Thornton Greear said.
With the Marquette and Petoskey locations set to be permanently closed by the end of April, Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and much of Northern Michigan will be more than 100 miles from a Planned Parenthood, with the next closest Planned Parenthood clinic to Marquette nearly five hours away, in Traverse City.
The closing of the Marquette clinic is a sad affair, the Marquette County Democratic Party said in a news release Thursday, adding that the group stands ready to advocate for those in the Upper Peninsula to continue to receive the services they had been accessing through the Planned Parenthood clinic.
“We are outraged by the partisan Republican federal funding freeze that caused the loss of the local clinic. Planned Parenthood has long put into practice values that Democrats hold dear, such as personal autonomy, women’s rights, LGBTQIA+ rights, and affordable access to health care services,” the party said in a news release.

(File photo by Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Untraceable firearms are a growing problem in Rhode Island even as overall crimes are trending downward, according to a newly published report from state Attorney General Peter Neronha.
The latest Gun Crimes Report released Thursday notes that state prosecutors charged and disposed of 751 cases involving illegal firearms in 2024. That represents a nearly 10% decrease from the previous year.
Despite the decline, the AG is still sounding the alarm over the number of illegally-possessed firearms in the state.
“The data provided in this year’s report supports what we know to be true: Rhode Island has a gun problem,” Neronha wrote in the report submitted to Senate President Dominick J. Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi. “Our communities continue to be inundated with firearms, and as you are aware, more guns in the hands of criminals means more gun violence and death.”
That’s been especially true regarding cases in recent years surrounding so-called “ghost guns,” firearms that are crafted at home using a 3D printer or a mail-order kit. Legislation passed in 2020 prohibits the possession, sale and manufacturing of these kinds of weapons. 
In 2022, Rhode Island saw 66 cases involving ghost guns but over the past two years that number has jumped. In 2023 there were 99 cases and last year, there were100 cases. Most of the guns were  produced with parts from Polymer80, one of the country’s largest manufacturers of ghost gun kits. 
In addition to the state’s ban on ghost guns, the AG reports ongoing violations of the law prohibiting gun magazines holding more than 10 rounds. The law was enacted in 2022 and was upheld by a federal appeals court  last March following a challenge from a group of gun owners who said the legislation violated the Second Amendment.
Prosecutors last year charged 246 cases involving magazines with capacity between 11 and 30 bullets — down 16% from 2023. Cases where someone owned magazines with the capacity for over 30 bullets rose 5%, according to the AG’s office.
Neronha touted that his office is “working tirelessly” to address illegally-owned firearms through enforcement of existing laws and advocating for new ones such as last year’s mandate that all firearms not in use by the owner or another authorized user be stored in a locked container or equipped with a tamper-resistant lock. 
The AG, along with Gov. Dan McKee and other general officers, are pushing lawmakers to ban assault-style weapons.
“Combatting gun violence is, and will always be, a top priority for my office,” Neronha wrote. “Rhode Islanders deserve to live long, happy lives free from the threat of gun violence, and we intend to continue doing everything we can to keep them safe.” 
Reached for comment on the latest data, spokespeople for the House and Senate said Shekarchi and Ruggerio had not yet reviewed the report. The same applies to Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican who has been a staunch opponent of the state’s gun safety laws. 
The House Minority Office did not respond to immediate request for comment.

Mike Braun signed another round of bills into law Thursday. (Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun signed 20 bills into law Thursday, including one that would expunge certain civil “red flag” proceedings and another impacting carbon dioxide sequestration projects.
Lawmakers have sent Braun 38 bills thus far, and he has signed all of them.
House Enrolled Act 1137 would create a method to expunge “red flags” from a person’s public record. The Hoosier State’s red flag law allows police to temporarily remove firearms from people considered “dangerous,” with an aim to curb gun violence.
There are two situations in which a person might receive an expungement. First, if someone who was alleged to be dangerous was later found not to be. Second, if courts determined someone was dangerous, but after the person got help, deemed them safe.
Committee testimony revealed that Hoosiers had lost jobs and volunteer opportunities because of old red flag notices. An amendment clarified that law enforcement would still have access.
A bill on carbon dioxide sequestration projects also got a signature.
Senate Enrolled Act 457 exempts pipeline companies from needing to get certificates of authority in certain cases, creates a permit for exploratory wells and well conversions; adds inspection provisions; charges new fines for legal violations; and tweaks other fee amounts. Originally, fines and fees would’ve gone to dedicated funds to defray state spending on project administration and monitoring.
But an amendment in the Senate directs the money to the state’s General Fund instead. Lawmakers are still trying to find a compromise, which could be put in another piece of legislation before the session ends.
Braun also signed House Enrolled Act 1033, which seeks to reduce financial strain on construction contractors. It impacts only public works projects.
It eliminates the minimum retainage requirement for publicly funded projects and lowers the maximum withholding percentages by 4%. Retainage is the portion of payment withheld from a contractor or subcontractor until a construction project reaches substantial or full completion.
All of the legislation Braun has signed is listed online.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)In what appears to be the near end of this year’s Idaho legislative session, Idaho Republican legislative leaders are backing — and quickly approving — a bill to let ivermectin be sold as an over-the-counter medicine.
Typically used to treat parasites in humans, ivermectin has drawn interest since the COVID pandemic — after largely conservative activists, doctors and politicians touted it as an alternative medicine. But the U.S. Food and Drug and Administration, or FDA, hasn’t approved ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19, saying the federal agency finds that existing clinical trial data don’t show “ivermectin is effective against COVID 19 in humans.”
Idaho’s Senate Bill 1211 would let ivermectin be sold over-the-counter, without a prescription or consultation with a health care professional.
On Monday, it was introduced. On Wednesday, it passed by a Senate committee. On Thursday, it passed the Senate. 
All that happened without public input from medical professionals. 
Dr. Sky Blue, who works with ivermectin in his practice as infectious disease doctor in Idaho, told the Idaho Capital Sun that the bill is part of a broader trend to promote unproven medical remedies and disregard their risks — over more proven treatments. 
“We have had very well done, well executed and favorable clinical trials showing that paxlovid, molnupiravir and remdesivir have positive effects (as anti-viral COVID treatments),” Blue said in a Tuesday interview. “And all the studies with ivermectin have not shown to have benefit,” adding that severe toxicities have been found in ivermectin’s COVID use.

 Many Idaho Republican senators tap into ivermectin cure-all rhetoric — conflicting with medical guidance

When he pitched the bill in committee on Wednesday, bill cosponsor Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, appeared to tap into the broader national rhetoric, saying ivermectin has been called a “wonder drug.”

“This is a drug that has had really immeasurable impacts on improving the lives of billions and billions of people throughout the world since it was discovered. It’s been called, in many places, a wonder drug,” Anthon, the top Idaho Senate Republican, told lawmakers in committee. “It’s been able to serve in treating and in many ways curing human diseases — treating parasites, worms in humans. And in most countries, it is legal over the counter.”
The Senate passed the bill on a 25-9 vote Thursday, sending the bill to the House. Five of the Senate’s six Democrats opposed the bill, joined by four Republicans; Democratic Sen. Ali Rabe, from Boise, was absent. 
The bill now heads to the House. To become law, Idaho bills must pass the House and Senate, and avoid the governor’s veto. 
If Idaho’s ivermectin deregulation bill becomes law, it would take effect immediately — through an emergency clause.
The bill is cosponsored by the top Republicans in the Idaho House and Senate — Anthon and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star — along with two other lawmakers: Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, and Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene.

 Sen. Tammy Nichols touts ivermectin as cureall. Doctors, FDA disagree. 

On Thursday, Republican lawmakers who debated in favor of the bill the Idaho Senate also tapped into the national cure-all rhetoric around ivermectin. 
In opening arguments for the bill on the Senate floor, Nichols spoke for about seven minutes — out of the roughly 35-minute debate.

She listed a range of ailments people have used ivermectin for.
“Some people will use it like taking vitamins,” Nichols told lawmakers.
The FDA warns that large doses of ivermectin “can be dangerous.” Overdoses can risk death, the federal regulator’s website says, and human-appropriate doses can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners. 
Anthon has said the bill would mean people aren’t turning to veterinarian sources to find the drug, arguing patients could use it more safely with better dosing information.

Stressing he wasn’t a doctor or pharmacist, Sen. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls, said the doctors and pharmacists he’d talked with say making ivermectin available without a prescription is “not a good idea because there is no testing yet. … We don’t know all the benefits or the faults of it.” 
Usually, the FDA handles whether drugs should be made available over-the-counter, a process that uses data on safety and effectiveness.
Debating in favor of the bill, Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, incorrectly claimed the FDA never fully approved a COVID vaccine.
“If we’re using the FDA as the benchmark for what’s approved or not approved, if you trust that, I believe that — I don’t think the COVID shot ever got out of emergency use authorization. That was never approved by the FDA, as far as I’m concerned,” Bjerke told the Senate.

In 2021, the FDA approved Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine — which was the first COVID vaccine to advance past emergency use authorization. 
Two states allow ivermectin to be sold over-the-counter, according to local news reports: Arkansas passed a law this year, and Tennessee passed a law three years ago. North Carolina is considering a similar bill. 
 Some committee members worried about lack of doctor input

The lack of input from medical experts drew consternation from some lawmakers on the Senate State Affairs Committee, which spent about a half hour considering the bill on Wednesday.

In committee, Sen. Treg Bernt, R-Meridian, said he wanted to talk to a couple doctors about the bill. But he repeatedly suggested the bill’s risk wasn’t high.
“I’m not a tin-hat-wearing legislator. I’m not a conspiracy theorist. I think we’re going to be OK with ivermectin,” he said. “I’m not — certainly wouldn’t be against it, I guess. But I just … want to know more about it.”
On Thursday, Bernt voted for the bill on the Senate floor. 
The committee’s only Democrat, Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said he’d oppose the bill. He said the drug is being politicized.
“Political reasons are not a good basis for making a decision to make a prescription drug an over-the-counter drug,” Ruchti said in committee. “That decision should be driven by the science. It should be driven by data and research. And we have none of that in front of us.”

The committee’s chairman, Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCannon, said he’d oppose the bill in committee but he might change his mind later.
His younger brother took ivermectin when he got COVID, and “he thought he was going to die,” Guthrie told the committee.
“Now, was that the ivermectin or advanced COVID? Who knows. But he felt like it could have very, very well been the ivermectin. Did he think that if a little’s good, a lot will do better? Possibly. And maybe that’s … the risk you take when you don’t have that consultation,” Guthrie said. 
Guthrie opposed the bill on the Senate floor, joined by three other Republican lawmakers: Sens. Van Burtenshaw, from Terreton; Cook; and Dave Lent, from Idaho Falls. 
 What the committee heard: Opposition from pharmacy industry representative, and support from attorney

Only two people testified on the bill:

Brian Festa, an attorney who is the co-founder of the nonprofit Caldwell-based public interest law firm We The Patriots USA. Saying he represented himself, Festa testified briefly in support of the bill. He referenced a lawsuit his law firm was involved in over a Minnesota patient’s struggle to get ivermectin as a need for the bill. 
And Pam Eaton, the CEO of the Idaho Retailers Association which represents Idaho pharmacies. In the past eight hours, she told the committee she’d heard from more pharmacists than she’d heard from throughout this year’s Idaho legislative session, adding that 99% of people she’d heard from were opposed to the bill. 

Eaton said without an over-the-counter label, pharmacies can’t sell ivermectin over-the-counter. Some might be able to, but she said most are saying they can’t.
Throughout her testimony, Eaton stressed she is not a pharmacist. But she relayed patient safety concerns she said she’d heard from a pharmacist about ivermectin.
“It has serious interactions with five medications, and requires close monitoring with 51 medications, including commonly used antibiotics, cholesterol, heart medications and other (over-the-counter) antihistamines,” Eaton said. 
That’s the sort of information that would be on an over-the-counter medication label, she added.

Sharice Davids, both Kansas Democrats, object to President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping trade tariffs because the result will undermine the agriculture economy and raise consumer prices. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Democratic Governors Association's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly condemned as unacceptable the imposition of sweeping tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners by President Donald Trump because of damage to the Kansas agriculture economy and additional financial pressure on consumers struggling with inflation.
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said Trump’s commitment to a chaotic global trade war was contrary to the president’s 2024 campaign promise to tamp down the plague of domestic inflation. Trump’s latest 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports amplified the prospect of international retaliation against goods exported by the United States. On Thursday, Wall Street fell into sharp decline as concern about recession in the United States and abroad escalated.
“As the governor of Kansas, a state whose farmers feed the nation and the world, the imposition of tariffs without consideration of the immediate and devastating impact on our agricultural industry and others, is unacceptable,” Kelly said.
The two-term Democratic governor said Americans didn’t elect Trump so the Republican president could foster “chaos, anxiety and uncertainty for businesses and consumers across the nation.” She said Trump’s perspective on tariffs, or international trade taxes, made it difficult for Kansas farmers to plan for the future. She said Trump’s tariffs were expected to cost U.S. families more than $5,000 per year.
“The cost of living is the number one issue, not only on Kansans’ minds, but on the minds of families across the country,” Kelly said. “From groceries to gas to housing, too many families are struggling to get by and are looking to their leaders for real solutions.”
Kelly said 36 states would conduct elections of governors in 2026, and “Republicans running for governor won’t be able to run” from Trump’s destructive tariffs.
While Kansas Republicans have been loathe to publicly criticize Trump’s trade agenda, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, introduced a bill that would provide Congress more leverage in terms of setting tariffs.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat serving the 3rd District centered on the Kansas City region, said Kansans would be forced to foot the bill for Trump’s misguided leadership.
“His trade policies are driving up grocery costs, forcing Kansas businesses to close and cutting off markets for our farmers,” said Davids, who serves on the House Agriculture Committee. “I’m focused on pursuing smart trade agreements that strengthen American industries without putting jobs and small businesses at risk.”
Davids said the right-leaning Tax Foundation reported tariffs enacted during Trump’s first term were paid for by U.S. consumers and businesses as the cost of trade barriers filtered down.
On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs of at least 10% on most goods coming into the United States. He vowed to impose higher import taxes on dozens of countries and territories. Trump’s plan included tariff rates of 34% on China, 20% on the European Union and 46% on Vietnam.
Trump maintained tariffs would help the U.S. economy by bringing back manufacturing jobs. He asserted it was necessary for the United States to respond aggressively because “our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by trading partners for decades.
Critics of Trump’s trade offensive viewed tariffs as a regressive tax, especially in the short run, because the financial burden of higher prices fell on households at the bottom of the economic scale rather than people at the top of the income ladder.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont joined Kelly for the video news conference hosted by the Democratic Governors Association.
“A tariff is a six letter word for tax, and this is a tax on the American people,” Lamont said. “I see that Donald Trump is calling today ‘Liberation Day.’ As far as I can see, the only thing being liberated will be two, three, four hundred dollars a month out of your wallet.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kelly-tariffs-1024x526.png,,,2025-04-03 16:04:16.203427

(Getty Images) (This photo cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — As the number of measles cases increased to 10, state health officials warned that some people may have been exposed to the disease at an Oklahoma City children’s hospital and a Weatherford restaurant.
The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported this week that people may have been exposed at the OU Health’s Children’s Hospital on March 23 from 6:15 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the facility’s emergency department, atrium and elevators.
People may have been exposed to the virus at Luigi’s Italian Restaurant and Lounge in Weatherford between 5:30 p.m. and 9 p.m on March 19. 
Officials said if people were not at the listed locations during those timeframes, there is no risk of exposure, but those who were should “exclude themselves from public setting for 21 days” if they are not vaccinated or have not previously had the infection. They’re also urged to report suspected exposure to state health officials.  
Oklahoma health officials reported the first cases of measles in the state last month. All 10 patients are unvaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown, according to data released this week by health officials.
The initial cases were reported in Owasso and Claremore areas. They were linked to an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico, which has sickened over 470 people and killed two. 
Health officials said two doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine are 97% effective at preventing the disease while one dose is about 93% effective.
Measles is contagious four days before the onset of the rash and until five days after the rash appears, according to the Health Department website.

State records indicate Angela Jansen of Central City worked for the DNR as a conservation officer from October 2018 to August 2023, when she was fired for conduct unbecoming a state employee and for the unauthorized personal use of a DNR database.
Jansen recently filed a lawsuit against the DNR in Polk County District Court, alleging the department violated her civil rights when it fired her as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder triggered by fatalities she encountered at work.
In her lawsuit, Jansen says she “witnessed multiple critical incidents involving the tragic deaths of others,” including a 2018 incident during her field training when a pickup truck become engulfed in flames and the occupant was unable to escape the vehicle.
In 2019, the lawsuit alleges, Jansen witnessed a second catastrophic vehicle accident at work where she was unable to assist the victims. “After witnessing these horrific events, Jansen was not offered any counseling or other services, in violation of department policy,” the lawsuit claims. “As a result, her mental health began to deteriorate.”
In May 2023, Jansen alleges, she was involved in an on-duty incident where a person drowned and again, the department failed to follow its critical incident policy by requiring her to attend mandatory counseling.
Jansen alleges that on the evening of June 14, 2023, while off duty in Ankeny, she consumed alcohol as a mechanism to cope with her mental health struggles. Officers from the Ankeny Police Department provided Jansen with a ride home later that same evening, the lawsuit claims.
On June 28, 2023, Jansen was informed by the DNR that she was suspended pending an investigation into her conduct. A month later, Jansen’s medical provider diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder and she requested a leave of absence from the department, proposing the department pause its personnel investigation into her conduct on June 14, 2023, so that she could first obtain treatment. On Aug. 2, Jansen was fired.
State alleges unprofessional conduct
Jansen’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate a disability, retaliation, and violations of the Iowa Civil Rights Act.
The state has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. However, it did challenge Jansen’s claim for unemployment benefits after her dismissal. In that case, the state alleged that during the June 14, 2023, incident, Jansen was off duty and on a date while carrying her service weapon in her purse. At some point in the evening, Jansen called an ex-boyfriend to come pick her up from her date.
The ex-boyfriend is a felon, according to state records, and while he and Jansen were in his car the two began arguing. The argument escalated to the point where the ex-boyfriend’s Apple watch determined there was an emergency of some kind and dialed 911 without the two realizing it.
Ankeny police arrived on the scene and began investigating the matter. The DNR’s law enforcement bureau chief, Craig Cutts, later testified that he reviewed the officers’ body-camera footage and saw video of Jansen telling the responding officers she had a gun in her purse. When asked why she had a gun, Jansen reportedly identified herself as a DNR officer.
During the discussion with police, Jansen allegedly asked one of the officers if he dated older women and referred to him as “Officer Hot Stuff,” the DNR later alleged. In addition, she reportedly admitted more than once that it was likely that she was drunk at the time, then informed the officers she had used a state database maintained by the DNR to determine the marital status of at least one person she was considering dating.
Ankeny police did not arrest Jansen or issue any citations, but they did confiscate the purse with the gun in it and drove Jansen home where they returned the items.
Shortly thereafter, Jansen reported some details of the incident to Cutts. Jansen’s direct supervisor, Capt.  Deb Vitko, then contacted Cutts and allegedly told him she had heard about the incident over the police radio and there was more to the story than what Jansen had self-reported. She reportedly told Cutts about the firearm and said there appeared to be some question as to whether the ex-boyfriend had been held against his will.
Cutts then initiated an investigation and reviewed the body-camera footage and police reports.  The department ultimately concluded Jansen had acted in a manner unbecoming of a state employee and that she had improperly accessed and then used information from the DNR database.
Jansen’s application for jobless benefits was later decided by Administrative Law Judge Alexis Rowe who ruled that Jansen’s off-duty behavior was disqualifying job-related misconduct.
Jansen “acted inappropriately with a police officer, asking him if he dated older women and calling him ‘Officer Hot Stuff,’” Rowe stated. The judge added that Jansen “also admitted more than once that it was likely she was drunk. These actions were objectively harmful to the employer’s interests in maintaining the reputation of professionalism for its officers.”
According to state records, Jansen had one previous disciplinary warning for conduct unbecoming a state employee. That warning, which was coupled with a suspension, was issued in June 2021 after Jansen was arrested for drunken driving in Linn County where tests showed she had a blood-alcohol level of .172 percent — more than twice the legal limit.
In that case, Jansen was convicted of first-offense drunken driving and sentenced to 48 hours in jail to be served on weekends.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DNR-lawsuit.jpg,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

(gregobagel/Getty Images)Washington is suing a property management software company and a handful of landlords over allegations they colluded to inflate rents through a price-fixing scheme, Attorney General Nick Brown announced Thursday.
The state says RealPage has three products to help landlords calculate rental prices and manage occupancy. The company uses nonpublic information that landlords agree to share to create an algorithm that pushes them to raise rents, according to the lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court. 
Instead of competing, the landlords all raise their prices together based on RealPage’s recommendations, according to the complaint. So instead of the market helping determine rents, it’s software.
RealPage also tells landlords to nix discounts they give to attract tenants, the lawsuit alleges. And it reportedly recommends keeping units vacant to keep rents up, instead of leasing them for a lower price.
In a press conference Thursday, Brown said property managers used the Texas-based RealPage software to price an estimated 800,000 leases in Washington between 2017 and 2024. About a third of Washington residents are renters, according to the lawsuit.
In 2023, more than half of Washington’s renters paid more than 30% of their income toward rent, according to a state report released in December.
“Pricing is higher and occupancy is lower for properties managed by landlords using RealPage than for those that don’t,” Brown said. “Washington needs a competitive market to help with our critical shortage of affordable, multifamily housing. RealPage’s unfair practices are drowning renters and pricing more and more families out of stable housing in Washington.”
The lawsuit alleges RealPage and nine landlords violated the state’s Consumer Protection Act by stifling competition.
“It’s price fixing, it’s illegal and it hurts Washingtonians,” Brown said.
Chris Vialpando, a renter in Seattle’s Lower Queen Anne neighborhood, said his landlord raised his rent over 50% in 2022 based on RealPage’s algorithm. He said he is one of many “falling victim to the collusion, thereby perpetuating this already complex, systemic housing crisis.”
“And I also understand that inflation and market adjustments are naturally part of the rental economy, but what I don’t understand is how these predatory companies can continue to operate freely without continuous authoritative examination and scrutiny,” Vialpando said.
The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, when he was still attorney general, launched an investigation into the RealPage software in early 2023. 
The investigation came on the heels of a ProPublica report on RealPage’s algorithm that found just 10 property managers oversaw 70% of apartments in a Seattle neighborhood. All of them used RealPage’s pricing software.
The state had previously been part of an ongoing federal lawsuit along with other states and the U.S. Department of Justice over antitrust concerns, but dropped out of that case in late February. The attorney general’s office withdrew from that lawsuit because “we saw a bigger problem,” Brown said.
“We saw a conspiracy, and we saw a greater path to help more renters,” he said. “We filed this case in state court because we believe that state law protects a greater number of Washingtonians and tenants than the federal case.”
Tenants across the country have also brought a class-action lawsuit against RealPage and its property management clients that is ongoing in federal court in Tennessee. 
Washington’s lawsuit asks a judge to declare the conduct illegal, award restitution and hand down civil penalties.
The landlords named as defendants in the complaint are Greystar, Cushman & Wakefield, LivCor, UDR, Prime Administration, Quarterra Multifamily Communities, LaSalle Properties, MG Properties and Sares Regis Management Company.
Lawmakers in Olympia are also looking to ban algorithmic rental price-fixing this year. Senate Bill 5469 would prohibit the collection of data that feeds recommendations for rental rates and bar landlords from obtaining those recommendations. The attorney general would enforce violations of the proposed law.
The state Senate passed the measure on a party-line vote this month, and it is now moving through the House.
This week, RealPage sued the city of Berkeley, California, over a similar ordinance aimed at stopping landlords from using algorithms to set rents.
In an interview the day he took office in January, the new attorney general said one of his top priorities was tackling “unjust, illegal, misleading business practices” in the housing sector.
“It’s our job to be a watchdog, and make sure that housing is affordable and available for everyone,” Brown said at the time.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fremont-seattle-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

(Photo by YouraPechkin/	iStock / Getty Images Plus)Sue Sheridan’s baby boy, Cal, suffered brain damage from undetected jaundice in 1995. Helen Haskell’s 15-year-old son, Lewis, died after surgery in 2000 because weekend hospital staffers didn’t realize he was in shock.
The episodes turned both women into advocates for patients and spurred research that made American health care safer.
On April 1, the Trump administration slashed the organization that supported that research — the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ — and fired roughly half of its remaining employees as part of a perplexing reorganization of the federal Health and Human Services Department.
Haskell, of Columbia, South Carolina, has done research and helped write AHRQ-published surveys and guidebooks on patient engagement for hospitals. The dissolution of AHRQ is dislodging scores of experienced patient-safety experts, a brain drain that will be impossible to rectify, she said.
Survey data gathered by AHRQ provides much of what is known about hospitalizations for motor accidents, measles, methamphetamine, and thousands of other medical issues.
“Nobody does these things except AHRQ,” she said. “They’re all we’ve got. And now the barn door’s closed.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted on the social platform X on April 1 that layoffs at HHS, aimed at reducing the department’s workforce by about 20,000 employees, were the result of alleged inefficacy.
“What we’ve been doing isn’t working,” he said. “Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year.”
But neither Kennedy nor President Donald Trump have explained why individual agencies such as AHRQ were targeted for cuts or indicated whether any of their work would continue.
At their first meeting with the leadership of AHRQ last month, officials from Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency said that they didn’t know what the agency did — and that its budget would be cut by 80% to 90%, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who were granted anonymity because of fears of retribution.
On March 28, the administration said AHRQ would merge with HHS’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
An AHRQ spokesperson, Rachel Seeger, said its acting chief, Mamatha Pancholi, was unavailable to answer questions.
Created on the foundation of an earlier agency in 1999, AHRQ has had two major functions: collecting survey data on U.S. health care expenditures, experiences, and outcomes; and funding research aimed at improving the safety and delivery of health care. It also has published tools and guidelines to enhance patient safety.
Its latest budget of $513 million amounts to about 0.04% of HHS spending.
Newly sworn-in Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary, a surgeon who has advocated for patient safety, wrote or co-authored at least 10 research papers supported by AHRQ funding since 1998.
AHRQ research and guidelines played a key role in lowering the incidence of hospital-acquired infections — such as deadly blood infections caused by contaminated IV lines, which fell 28% from 2015 to 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Medical residents training in the 1980s were taught that such infections were an inevitable, often fatal byproduct of heart surgery, but AHRQ-funded research “showed that fairly simple checklists about preventing infections would be effective at going to zero,” said Richard Kronick, a University of California-San Diego researcher who led AHRQ from 2013 to 2016.
Medical errors caused by missed diagnoses, drug errors, hospital infections, and other factors kill and maim tens of thousands of Americans each year. Makary published a controversial study in 2016 hypothesizing that errors killed 250,000 people a year in the U.S. — making medical mistakes the nation’s third-leading cause of death.
“There are all kinds of terrible things about our health care system’s outcomes and how we pay for it, the most expensive care in the world,” Kronick said. “Without AHRQ, we’d be doing even worse.”
AHRQ-funded researchers such as Hardeep Singh at Baylor College of Medicine have chipped away at patient safety risks for more than two decades. Singh devises ways to integrate technologies like telemedicine and artificial intelligence into electronic health records to alert doctors to potential prescribing errors or misdiagnoses.
Singh has 15 scholars and support staff members supported by three AHRQ grants worth about $1.5 million, he said. The elimination of the agency’s office that funds outside researchers, among the cuts announced this week, is potentially “career-ending,” he said. “We need safety research to protect our patients from harms in health care. No organization in the world does more for that than AHRQ.”
Republicans have long been skeptical of AHRQ and the agency that preceded it. Some doctors saw it as meddling in their medical practices, while some GOP Congress members viewed it as duplicating the mission of the National Institutes of Health.
But when the Trump administration proposed merging it with NIH in 2018, a House-ordered study into health research priorities validated AHRQ’s valuable role.
Now, the naysayers have triumphed.
Gordon Schiff, a Harvard Medical School internist who has received AHRQ funding since 2001, was among the first to learn about policy changes there when in February he got an email from the editors of an AHRQ patient-safety website informing him “regretfully” that a 2022 case study on suicide prevention he co-authored had been removed “due to a perception that it violates the White House policy on websites ‘that inculcate or promote gender ideology.’”
The article was not about gender issues. It briefly mentioned that LGBTQ men were at a higher risk for suicide than the general population. Schiff was offered the option of removing the LGBTQ reference but refused. He and Harvard colleague Celeste Royce have sued AHRQ, HHS, and the Office of Personnel Management over removal of the article.
“All we were doing was presenting evidence-based risk factors from the literature,” he said. “To censor them would be a violation of scientific integrity and undermine the trustworthiness of these websites.”
PSNet, the AHRQ publication where Schiff and Royce’s article appeared, has been dissolved, although its website was still up as of April 2. Roughly half of AHRQ’s 300 staffers resigned following the initial DOGE warning; 111 staff members were fired April 1, according to an email that a top executive, Jeffrey Toven, sent to employees and was shown to KFF Health News. AHRQ’s remaining leadership was in the dark about Kennedy’s plans, he said.
HHS spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.
Stephen Parente, a University of Minnesota finance professor who said he consults informally with Trump health officials, said much of AHRQ’s work could be done by others. Its most vital services have been surveys that Westat, a private research company, performs for AHRQ on contract, said Parente, who was chief economist for health policy in the first Trump administration.
At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said, data produced by AHRQ and other government sources were outclassed by private sources. To track COVID, he relied on daily feeds of private insurance data from around the country.
Still, Parente said, the virtual disappearance of AHRQ means “we’re going to lose a culture of research that is measured, thoughtful, and provides a channel for young investigators to make their marks.”
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the CDC conduct some health system quality research, but they are also losing staff, Harvard’s Schiff noted.
One of Schiff’s current AHRQ projects involved interviewing late-stage cancer patients to determine whether they could have been diagnosed earlier.
“The general public, I think, would like cancer to be diagnosed earlier, not when it’s stage 4 or stage 3,” he said. “There are things we could learn to improve our care and get more timely diagnosis of cancer.”
“Medical errors and patient safety risks aren’t going to go away on their own,” he said.
With input from Sheridan and other mothers of children who suffered from jaundice-related brain damage, AHRQ launched research that led to a change in the standard of care whereby all newborns in the U.S. are tested for jaundice before discharge from hospitals. Cases of jaundice-related brain damage declined from 7 per 100,000 to about 2 per 100,000 newborns from 1997 to 2012.
The misfortune of Lewis, Haskell’s son, led to a change in South Carolina law — the bipartisan Lewis Blackman Hospital Patient Safety Act of 2005 — and later to a national requirement for hospitals to enable patients to demand emergency responses under certain circumstances.
Singh, a leading researcher on AI in health care, sees bitter irony in the way the Elon Musk-led DOGE has taken an ax to AHRQ, which recently put out a new request for proposals to study the technology. “Some think AI will fix health care without a human in the loop,” Singh said. “I doubt we get there by dismantling people who support or perform patient safety research. You need a human in the loop.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — It was not your typical day in the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke and six associate justices donned their traditional black robes and convened to hear customary oral arguments — but only after maneuvering past the theater props, art supplies and other items common to the back stage of a school auditorium.
The state’s high court judges peppered attorneys with questions about the appellate case at hand. But in a different twist afterward, they faced their own barrage of questions from a group of curious teenagers.

Wednesday’s official Supreme Court proceedings played out on a stage at Omaha Bryan High School. Taking a real-life court session out of the State Capitol and on the road was part of the Court’s efforts to increase public understanding and trust in the judicial system, and to inspire more young people to join the legal profession.
 Real people

For Kyra Carpenter, editor-in-chief of the Bryan High Orator, the event on Bear turf pulled back the curtain on a system she had only read about. She said she came to school “really nervous” to ask questions of the justices, but later felt at ease. 
“They seem more like people, more real,” the junior said after the event. “They even laughed at one of my jokes.”
Saúl Muñoz-Macias, also a junior, said he will be the first in his family to go to college when he pursues a political science and economics degree on the way to law school. 
“It’s cool to see this,” the 16-year-old said. “I’d like to be in a position like them some day.”

Joining Funke on the auditorium stage — before an audience of about 50 students from the school’s classes on American Government, Law and Juvenile Justice and AP History  — were Justices Lindsey Miller-Lerman, William Cassel, Jonathan Papik, Stephanie Stacy, John Freudenberg and Jason Bergevin. 
The Supreme Court, supported by the Nebraska State Bar Foundation, holds such school-based court sessions a few times a year in various parts of the state. A similar event was held earlier in the day at Creighton University School of Law.
While intended as outreach and education for students, Funke said in an interview that he believes judges also reap benefits.
“They ask us questions, they challenge us, and it makes us think a little bit about what we do, how we do it, why we do it and if there are ways we can do it better,” said Funke, a graduate of the University of Nebraska College of Law who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 2016 and elevated to chief justice last year.
 ‘Now a courtroom’ 

At Bryan, official business came to order about 1:30 p.m. with a shout from a member of the Nebraska State Patrol: “This room is now a courtroom…Welcome to the Supreme Court.” 
A student bailiff gave the “all rise” alert. Prior to that, the Patrol had searched and secured the school grounds. Student ambassadors escorted justices backstage, where they assembled before taking their seats.

 The spotlighted case had to do with a battle over a roadway, and a “prescriptive easement,” which is a legal right to use someone else’s property based upon a long-term, consistent and open use of that property without the expressed consent of the owner.
In this situation, a family had owned a swath of land in Otoe County since 1857. But the Little Nemaha River cuts off part of the property to the south, making it inaccessible to vehicles or farm machinery except by crossing through the neighboring Dowding property. 
The Dowding property owners grew frustrated enough to lock an access gate, which pushed the other family to sue, and a district court granted them access based on prescriptive easement. 
Attorneys David Domina and Ryan McIntosh argued their respective sides, and justices asked a lot of questions.
“I wasn’t expecting the judges to just interrupt them like they did — I was like, ‘Oh,’” said Kyra.
 Inquisition

Perhaps the tougher inquisition came after attorneys wrapped up their arguments, and as students stepped up to question the justices.
One teen wanted to know the judges’ most difficult or impactful case.
For Funke, that was deciding as a trial judge the fate of a child in a custody or divorce situation.

“What you want and what you can do sometimes are two different things,” he said. “You know the importance of it and if you get it wrong, the impact is significant for that child.”
Cassel talked about death penalty decisions.
“A very solemn and complicated undertaking,” he said, adding that such cases fortunately aren’t frequent. “That’s probably the highest single responsibility that one of us can have — (rendering) our judgement whether someone lives or dies.”
Asked to describe “most interesting” cases, Miller-Lerman recalled the Beatrice Six. Miller-Lerman — the first woman on the Nebraska Supreme Court and longest-serving member of the current high court — wrote the 7-0 opinion in 2007 that allowed DNA testing for two men in the Beatrice Six who had been convicted of murder in 1989.
Results showed neither man had committed the crime, leading to the exoneration of them and four others who had falsely confessed. They won a wrongful conviction judgement of $28 million.
Students ventured into politics, with one wondering if justices believed the country was in a “constitutional crisis” between the Trump administration and the courts.
Cassel suggested the student google President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “court-packing plan” and said, “We aren’t even close.”











We think it’s important you trust your judiciary. That’s why we take these opportunities.


– Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke



Another wanted to know if the justices feared for their jobs under Donald Trump’s administration, given that the president called for the removal of a judge who ruled against deportation plans.
Funke used the moment to delve into differences between Nebraska’s method of appointing and removing judges versus that of the federal government. In Nebraska, he noted, voters choose whether a judge should be retained. In a case of alleged bad behavior, a process overseen by a Judicial Qualifications Commission made up of attorneys and lay persons can sanction or remove a judge from the bench.
In response to a question about $80 million being poured into a Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Cassel differentiated between states that elect their judges and Nebraska, where the governor appoints judges from candidates submitted by a nominating commission. 
To one student’s observation that the high court spent a lot of time obsessing over terms such as consent and prescriptive and necessity easements, Papik said law school would prepare them for this new vocabulary.
“Much of what you’re doing is learning a new language,” he said.
 Building trust

When asked what the Supreme Court does to earn high school students’ trust, Stacy said: “We’re here.”

She said the hope is students “learn a little about how the process works.” She added, “Some of you might even be thinking, ‘Law school doesn’t sound horrible.’”
Stacy touched upon open access to courts, cameras in the courtroom, publicly broadcasted proceedings. “We don’t do our work in secret,” she told the teens.
Funke said if the Court loses its authority, rule of law gives way to survival of the fittest, and whoever is the strongest, has the most muscle or guns, he said.
“We think it’s important you trust your judiciary,” he said. “That’s why we take these opportunities.”

Students got a primer ahead of the proceedings from a couple of local lawyers: Abigail Moland of the Omaha McGrath North law firm and Ceci Menjivar, a Douglas County assistant public defender, who also is a Bryan alumna.
“It’s a great opportunity to give back and have Latino students see there are attorneys that look like them … and let them know ways they can contribute.”
Bryan Principal Anthony “CK” Clark-Kaczmarek said he wasn’t sure how his school was selected as a site, but that he jumped at what would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many in the student body.
“I loved that our kids were so fearless in the question-asking,” he said, adding that they hear a lot of news and were eager to hear the perspective of the state’s highest-level judges.
“All students really want to know is that things are going to be okay — that government is going to do the right thing and protect them.”
 ‘Back to the normal’

As is standard, the Supreme Court did not immediately announce a determination on the civil case argued Wednesday, Fey v. Olson. The Court relays decisions in written opinions filed with the Court’s clerk.

The justices stuck around to take photos with students. The principal took a selfie with the justices and students, at the urging of Carpenter. Funke said such road trips help the court reset.
He said he appreciated the atmosphere — the occasional school bell during proceedings, voices from hallways. He got a kick out of assembling with fellow judges backstage amid drama props, a change from pristine quarters in the Capitol.
“It kinda brings you back to the normal, everyday world,” said Funke.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee Senate on Thursday approved legislation that could subject churches and charitable organizations to lawsuits if they provide housing aid to immigrants without legal status who go on to commit a crime. 
The bill (SB227/HB11)  by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern, has drawn pushback from some faith leaders who contend it is a violation of their religious freedom and their faith-based mission to care for the stranger, and all those in need. 
The bill has yet to reach the House floor for a vote.
The bill doesn’t explicitly bar churches or nonprofit organizations from providing aid to legal or illegal immigrants, Taylor noted. But organizations that do so knowingly, he said, are undertaking a “misguided mission.”
  Churches that help immigrants who are in the U.S. without permanent legal status have a “misguided mission,” said Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“All it says is if you have assisted an illegal alien, and they commit a criminal act, then you can be held civilly liable,” Taylor said. 
“It doesn’t stop from them from doing it, if that’s their misguided mission — that they want to try and bring in people who are in our country illegally and help them establish themselves in our community — then they need to better vet and supervise the illegal aliens that are in the community that they have helped bring there.”
Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, noted the bill makes changes to a portion of Tennessee’s “Good Samaritan” statutes, which are designed to shield individuals and organizations that provide aid from lawsuits.
“What we are doing here is we are literally limiting the application of the Good Samaritan law,” Yarbro said. 
“We’re drawing in churches like the Catholic Church, which is focused on a great deal of work in housing and working with distressed communities — and frankly churches all across the state and other and non religious charitable orgs as well — and exposing them to civil liability for crimes committed by someone they helped.”
Taylor’s own pastor, Matt Crawford of Trinity Baptist Church in Cordova,  has pushed back against the notion churches should refrain from ministering to individuals without legal status, delivering a sermon in January that said “I don’t know the legal status of all our people who come to ESL. I don’t think we’re called on to police that as a church.”
The sermon, Fox13 Memphis reported, prompted Taylor to walk out.
Taylor told the Lookout last month that his message to churches was this:
“I would remind the churches that even heaven has an immigration policy,” he said. “You can’t climb over the wall in heaven.  You can’t slick talk St. Peter into the gates of heaven. There’s a very specific way you come into heaven to become a resident of heaven. They’ve got a very strict immigration policy, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable for Americans to have an immigration policy that people follow.”
Bills that target immigrant-serving nonprofits raise criticism from faith community 

The proposed legislation applies to Tennessee charities and churches that knowingly provide long term housing aid to individuals without legal status, including the act of providing assistance in obtaining or signing a lease.
The bill specifically excludes “temporary overnight housing,” such as services provided by homeless shelters, from liability. The bill’s language makes no specific exception for domestic violence shelters.
Under Tennessee’s personal injury laws, most crime victims and their survivors may sue for up to $1 million in non-economic damages and  $500,000 in punitive damages against those they are seeking to hold liable. There is no cap on economic damages, including lost wages and hospital bills.

Stebbins wrote in a memo announcing the investigation that the Inspector General Act of 1978 “authorizes us to have access to personnel and materials as we determine necessary to perform our oversight in a timely manner.”The purpose of the evaluation, he wrote, “is to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business. Additionally, we will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements.”The investigation will take place in Washington, D.C., as well as U.S. Central Command Headquarters in Tampa, Florida.Concerns about the use of Signal, an encrypted messaging app available commercially, began after The Atlantic published an article detailing how its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to a group chat exchanging messages about national security plans. The ensuing controversy has been dubbed “Signalgate.”Vice President J.D. Vance, Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and others were all in the group.They were discussing plans for U.S. troops to bomb Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has raised significant concerns about how senior Trump administration officials are communicating and handling classified information.",,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

(Photo by Cecilia Lynch/USDA)Previously frozen funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development Office has been released, funding rural energy projects and infrastructure for selling ethanol blended fuels at gas pumps. 
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced this week that funding allocated through the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program, or HBIIP, and the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, will be released, though the latter program requires an adjustment to projects. 
HBIIP, which funds projects to upgrade rural fuel stations to sell ethanol-blended fuels, like E15, E85, and B20, at the pump, was released for 543 projects, totaling $537 million, in 29 states. More than $4.5 million of HBIIP cost-share grants were awarded to upgrade Iowa fuel stations in a January allocation of the program. 
Rollins made the announcement during her first official visit to Iowa while at Elite Octane, an ethanol facility in Atlantic. Iowa officials, including Gov. Kim Reynolds, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn were also in attendance.

Ernst, who pushed for HBIIP funding in the past and for expanded access to ethanol fuel blends, thanked Rollins for creating “certainty” for farmers and biofuel producers in Iowa. 
“I’ve worked hard to help develop and maintain HBIIP over the years to ensure that from Casey’s to your local mom-and-pop gas stations, retail store owners have the tools they need to deliver higher blends of biofuels at the pump, expanding access to homegrown fuels and choices for consumers,” Ernst said in a statement. “This is another example of how the Trump administration is putting our rural communities first.”
Rollins said the announcement was part of the president’s “commitment to America’s farmers, ranchers and small businesses.” 
“Under the president’s leadership, we are moving away from the harmful effects of misguided climate policies like the Green New Deal,” Rollins said in a statement. “Instead, USDA will deploy energy investments that prioritize the needs of our rural communities.” 
On Jan. 14, USDA Rural Development announced a round of funding awards for REAP and HBIIP, with more than $5.6 million in grants benefitting Iowa businesses and communities. Nationally, USDA invested more than $3 billion in REAP projects and $323 million in HBIIP programs during the Biden-Harris administration. 
The latest round of funding, along with some previous rounds of the programs, was suspended by the Trump administration as part of the president’s day-one order to pause and evaluate programs established by former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw thanked Rollins for releasing the HBIIP funds and for noting the importance of the E-15, a fuel blend with a higher percentage of ethanol, in administration’s plan for “unleashing American energy.” 
“E15 is the only untapped, near-term market opportunity for American farmers and producers large enough to make a meaningful difference to today’s low prices,” Shaw said. 
IRFA and Attorney General Brenna Bird have urged congressional leaders to pass legislation that would permit the year-round sale of the fuel. A press release from USDA said the department is “aggressively exploring” ways to support the biofuels industry and to allow year-round E-15 sales. 
Ernst and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley were among 17 senators who signed a letter to the president Thursday urging permits for E-15 sales. 
“Utilizing American ethanol year-round is a direct solution to reinforcing our energy supply and reducing consumer costs, and the issuance of a nationwide waiver for the 2025 summer driving season is a clear path toward these shared goals,” the letter read.
REAP released, but with a catch 
REAP has funded initiatives such as rooftop solar power on small rural businesses and farms, energy efficiency upgrades including new refrigeration at rural grocery stores and other upgrades aimed at farm or rural business equipment. 
The USDA has said previously obligated recipients have 30 days, or until April 24, to submit revised project plans that eliminate any Biden-era climate mandates and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility mandates embedded in previous proposals to receive the previously obligated funds. 
Andy Olsen, a senior policy advocate with Environmental Law and Policy Center, said the requirement means farmers and rural small businesses have to “jump through more hoops” at a time when they are “already struggling with high costs and uncertainty.” 
“This isn’t cutting red tape; it’s adding more,” Olsen said in a statement. “The USDA claims to deliver on commitments but these new rules could result in awarded grants being permanently frozen.”
The stated goals of the president’s executive order include revising, suspending or rescinding programs that are “unduly burdensome” on oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources. 
Solar energy is not mentioned in the order.
“The (Inflation Reduction Act) was marketed as a cure-all but delivered more bureaucracy than benefits for rural families,” said Rollins in the press release. “This course correction puts those investments back to work to support President Trump’s vision for energy independence and sets rural America on a path to lasting prosperity.”
Olsen said the farmers and rural businesses already made investments into renewable energy upgrades after entering into agreements with USDA “in good faith.” 
“Farmers and rural small businesses want USDA to honor the commitments it already made,” Olsen said.

Nico Rios, R-Williston, speaks in favor of a resolution that would make public officials mandatory reporters of child abuse at an April 3, 2025, hearing. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A House committee on Thursday advanced a resolution that advises the 2027 Legislature to make lawmakers mandatory reporters of child abuse.
The proposal is sponsored by Rep. Nico Rios, R-Williston, and was drafted by the North Dakota Young Republicans. 
Rios said the organization is bringing the proposal, House Concurrent Resolution 3037, in light of news surrounding former Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg’s prison sentence.
A federal judge last week sentenced Holmberg to 10 years in prison after the former senator pleaded guilty to traveling abroad with the intent to have commercial sex with minors. Holmberg served in the state Legislature for more than four decades and held the powerful position of Senate Appropriations Committee chair.

Rios said the Young Republicans were particularly struck by a sentencing memo filed by a federal prosecutor last month that alleged Holmberg had a pattern of exploiting boys and young men. Mark Friese, Holmberg’s defense attorney, denied many of the allegations in the memo and said there’s no evidence Holmberg had sex with minors.
Rios said that he gets questions from constituents asking whether other public officials in state government knew about Holmberg’s conduct but stayed quiet.
“That is why we need mandatory reporting, we should be held to a higher standard,” Rios told the House Political Subdivisions Committee on Thursday morning.
Current mandatory reporters of child abuse include medical professionals, social workers, law enforcement and teachers, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services website.
The resolution also urges lawmakers to seek additional ways for the state to root out crimes against children by public officials, including by establishing new penalties.
The North Dakota Young Republicans suggest that the Legislature consider studying the issue during the upcoming interim session.
“We believe this study can begin to answer the question so many in our state are asking: How did this happen, and more importantly, how can we prevent it from ever happening again?” Derek Turbide, national committeeman for the North Dakota Young Republicans, said in testimony in support of the proposal.
The proposal originally contained verses from the Bible, which committee members voted to remove.
Some lawmakers also expressed concerns that the resolution ignores systems the state already has in place to combat child exploitation and neglect.
“I would support the study to make legislators mandatory reporters, but I think the rest is unnecessary,” said Rep. Jonathan Warrey, R-Casselton.
The committee gave the resolution a do-pass recommendation. The proposal is headed to the House floor for a vote.

In practice, freedom in our state doesn’t apply to everyone. For years, the leaders in our state government have sent a clear message: Some Mountaineers are free — they have the freedom to live their lives the way they see fit. Others have to play by our rules.
If you have decided to have an abortion, you can’t do that here. If you have decided to help your kid get the health care they need to be themselves, you can’t do that here, either. And with persistently high poverty, falling investments in public education, and a crisis in affordable child care, too many Mountaineers are trapped in generational hardship, working multiple jobs to scrape by.
Every year, our Legislature gets just eight weeks to address the concerns of hardworking West Virginians. But too often, these sessions are dominated by political agendas that create more problems than solutions for our most vulnerable, and just as often, any attempt to resolve structural challenges to our communities is pushed to the side by culture wars that just cause more harm. 
A clear example of these twisted priorities is abortion. Abortion is completely banned for nearly every person who lives in West Virginia. The Legislature made sure of that by enacting a near-total ban three years ago. And yet lawmakers continue to attack this care, advancing a bill this year that targets out-of-state providers of abortion care by threatening them with a prison sentence.
They’ve also kept up their attacks on gender-affirming health care. This year, lawmakers are working to eliminate an essential, life-saving mental health exception to the current ban on this care — an exception used by only a handful of young people who live here.
The thing is, these politicians are counting on us to sit on the sidelines. They would prefer that their constituents stay home and let them make all the decisions, no matter the cost. And if we let them get away with that, then we have truly lost our way as Mountaineers — as people who fight for our right to live without the government telling us what we can and cannot do. 
New bills are introduced week by week that seek to strip us of what little reproductive rights remain, and if we allow our lawmakers to act unchecked, they will just continue to take them from us and ignore the real issues that affect us. Our resistance is essential. 
That’s why, this Friday, April 4, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic is hosting a Reproductive Resistance Advocacy Day at the state legislature to provide Mountaineers from across the state an opportunity to show up, speak their mind, learn more about the state of their rights, and find community amongst life-minded advocates in this fight for accessible reproductive care. 
I’m a lifelong West Virginian and proud to be. I cherish my neighbors, my community, and, regardless of our differences, all of my fellow Mountaineers. We take care of one another. But it’s time we hold our lawmakers to that same principle and apply that care to our reproductive health as well. We can’t afford inaction or ignorance — our futures depend on it.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SB-299-20250306.jpg,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — The University of Kansas Housing fired scholarship hall proctor Anthony Alvarez after he spoke to the media and refused to intervene in protests against the elimination of gender-inclusive housing.
Students and residents of Grace Pearson Scholarship Hall launched a new protest Wednesday in front of Strong Hall to stand in solidarity with Alvarez.
Alvarez expressed little regret for participating in actions that led to his termination even though he can no longer live in the hall. He intends to keep protesting KU Housing’s decision.
“I can’t live in the place where I foster community,” he said. “I didn’t do this for the money. I did this for my community. It is very, very hurtful. But I am thankful for the amount of support I have received.”
KU Housing did not respond to email or phone calls seeking comment.
Alvarez was put on probation March 13 after a meeting with housing staff. In a letter obtained by Kansas Reflector, Emily Chellgren, KU Housing assistant director, said he violated policy by speaking to news media instead of forwarding the request to his supervisor “despite knowing job expectations prohibited (him) from doing so.”
Kansas Reflector interviewed Alvarez for a March 4 story about students protesting the decision to eliminate gender-inclusive housing.
Alvarez was terminated March 14 after staff were made aware via security footage that he helped residents hang a banner outside of Grace Pearson rather than addressing the situation with residents and filing an incident report. His termination letter, also obtained by Kansas Reflector, noted he was already on probation for speaking with a reporter.
“I think it’s a bad sign that for infractions as little as this, you could get fired and kicked out and very quickly find yourself in a position where you have to find a place to live,” Alvarez said. “This makes it so that these undergrad students really feel the necessity to enforce policy that they may consider to be unjust or discriminatory.”
According to an article published by the University Daily Kansan, eight residents and proctors of Grace Pearson spoke to the press under anonymity. No other proctors have been put on probation.
First Amendment lawyer Max Kautsch said because there’s no evidence of other proctors being put on probation for speaking to the press, KU Housing didn’t violate Alvarez’ free speech rights. But Kautsch said the university should be cautious of how it handles the situation going forward.
“The First Amendment’s been implicated, but to the extent there’s a violation, the facts right now don’t necessarily lend itself to that,” Kautsch said. “It’s the kind of thing if you’re the university, you got be conscious of.”
The protest Wednesday brought both Grace Pearson residents and other KU students together to protest in front of Strong Hall for nearly five hours. For student Leah Johnson, protecting the Grace Pearson community is key to the trans community at KU.
“As a trans person myself, gender-inclusive assignments are extremely important to me,” Johnson said. “Removing this is clearly a targeted action against trans communities that I will not stand for.”
Along with two protests, residents have taken to using sticky notes on their windows, creating messages like “GP for GIA” and “Keep GP Safe.” Banners hung in the hall by residents continue to be taken down by staff, seen in videos posted by residents.
“I’m choosing to protest because I think that it is a terrible decision to restrict gender inclusive assignments and to try to enforce gendered bathrooms,” said Michael Wieber, hall president. “I think it’s downright fascist, the idea of only certain people can use a bathroom, or we need to check your gender.”
According to the KU Housing handbook, decorations on windows should “generally be directed to the interior of the room.” Many residents with sticky notes in their windows were emailed this week by Housing notifying them they would be required to attend university conduct meetings in the next week.
Some students plan to continue protests and make their voices heard. Unlike scholarship hall proctors, residents including Wieber do not have restrictions on speaking to the press.
“We’re trying to get anything from KU,” Wieber said. “It’s effectively been two months where we’ve gotten radio silence from KU housing. It’s very clear that Grace Pearson doesn’t like the messages.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2276-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

It’s one of several pieces of legislation in the House this session that would allow for more litigation — something Insurance and Banking Committee member Rep. Mike Caruso noted Thursday while arguing against HB 1181. He was one of two “no” votes on the bill, which now heads to the House Judiciary Committee, its last stop before a full House vote.
“This feels good for the trial attorneys, and maybe we should call this the ‘Insurance and Trial Attorneys Subcommittee’ because I feel like we’re doing a lot just for the benefit of trial attorneys. And by doing that, I think we’re doing wrong for Floridians,” said Caruso, whose hawkish position on immigration has already put him at odds with House Speaker Daniel Perez, an attorney.
The Senate companion (SB 1256) has been referred to three committees: Banking and Insurance; Agriculture, Environment, and General Government Appropriations; and Rules. The bill hasn’t been heard by any of them.

Florida drivers now are required to carry $10,000 in PIP (for personal injury protection) coverage plus $10,000 in property damage liability insurance. Those are minimum requirements, and drivers can purchase additional coverage. According to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, just under 6% of drivers on Florida roads were uninsured as of February.










The chiropractors want you to protect them. They just told you that. God bless them. I love chiropractors. The hospitals want you to protect them. The doctors want you to protect them.  And funny, the insurance companies want you to protect them, too. But I ain't here to protect any of them, and neither are you. We're here to make sure that it's a fair and equitable moment in Florida when you put your key in your car and drive and somebody hurts you.


– Rep. Danny Alvarez

HB 1181 would eliminate the state’s no-fault law and drop the PIP mandate. Additionally, the bill would increase the minimum bodily injury liability coverage limits from $10,000 per person and $20,000 per incident to $25,000 per person and $50,000 per incident.
Opposition
Representatives of the insurance industry, health care sector, and business interests testified against the bill, arguing the new insurance would cost more and could cause lower-income drivers to drop their coverage and increase the number of uninsured motorists on the road.
Mark Delegal represents State Farm, the largest auto insurer in the state, as well as the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which represents some of the largest public hospitals and teaching institutions.
He testified that legislation passed in 2023 eliminating one-way attorney fees in coverage disputes and cracking down on bad faith lawsuits are beginning to take hold in the auto insurance market. Rates, he testified, are coming down as those changes take effect.
Also representing the hospitals, Delegal said scrapping the no-fault means drivers will go to court to prove who’s to blame for auto accidents and that takes time.
“Hospitals are going to see delayed payment and this is not good,” he said.
It was a theme echoed by Toni Large, who represents emergency room physicians and orthopaedic surgeons.
Large said that ER physicians bill the care they provide on a level of one through five, with the latter being trauma patients. 
Most care stemming from automobile accidents provided by her clients is a level three. While the PIP reimbursement for her physicians providing level 3 care is $1,500 she said, the payments come quickly.
“It really impacts physicians when they are waiting two years for payments,” she said.
Double paying?
Motorcyclists from across the state for the second time in two weeks trekked to Tallahassee to show support for PIP repeal because they are not eligible for the coverage. The Florida Justice Association, which represents trial attorneys, also spoke out in support of repeal, citing the high costs for paltry coverage.
Vero Beach attorney and FJA member Dane Ullian argued that PIP, initially passed 50 years ago and meant to provide health care for drivers involved in car accidents, is redundant now that an estimated 90% of residents have some form of health insurance.
Eliminating the mandate to buy the coverage means they won’t be paying double the costs of health insurance, he said.
“One of the reasons [auto] rates are so high is we have a vestigial tail of an antiquated insurance system from 50 years ago, the redundant PIP no-fault system which requires every single driver in the state of Florida to buy a state-regulated health insurance plan for $10,000 of coverage when almost 90% of Floridians already have health insurance,” Ullian said. 
“So, right now we’re forcing 90% of Florida drivers to buy a health plan they don’t want to fund coverage for the other 10% of Florida drivers to get a layer of coverage that they don’t need,” he said.
Bill sponsor Rep. Danny Alvarez said HB 1181 is about improving protections for Florida drivers and not about any particular industry. He noted that PIP laws have been changed at least five times since initially being passed — each time with the promise that the changes will reduce costs and ferret out fraud in the system. Savings have not come, he said, and the system does not make the driver whole.
“The chiropractors want you to protect them. They just told you that. God bless them. I love chiropractors. The hospitals want you to protect them. The doctors want you to protect them. And, funny, the insurance companies want you to protect them, too,” Alvarez said.
“But I ain’t here to protect any of them, and neither are you. We’re here to make sure that it’s a fair and equitable moment in Florida when you put your key in your car and drive and somebody hurts you,” he added.

Utah becomes the first state to ban adding fluoride to drinking water

Kennedy — along with Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency — will be coming to Salt Lake City on Monday to hold a news conference to discuss “MAHA legislation” passed by the 2025 Utah Legislature, state officials announced in a news release issued Thursday. 
That includes HB81, which made Utah the first state in the nation to ban adding fluoride to public water systems. 
State leaders also called out two other bills they expect to highlight Monday, including HB402, which bans public schools from serving food with certain food dyes in them and other additives, and HB403, which restricts Utahns from using SNAP benefits to purchase candy and soda. 
Republican Utah lawmakers including House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, are expected to join Kennedy and Zeldin for Monday’s news conference. 
Other lawmakers slated to attend include House Majority Whip Karianne Lisonbee, R-Clearfield; Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove; Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Provo, and Rep. Kristen Chevrier, R-Highland.

But the House, which is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, has agreed to spend up to $700 million on infrastructure projects — around half of the Senate DFL target.
DFL House Leader Melissa Hortman said Monday the House target could change in negotiations with the Senate and governor. 
Known around the Capitol as a “bonding bill,” the Legislature typically funds public works projects with borrowed money in even years; the Constitution requires a 60% supermajority for passage, which means the bill requires robust bipartisan support. Bonding bills raise money for infrastructure projects by directing state agencies to sell off bonds; the state then pays back the bond holders over time, with interest. 
“At a time when the federal government is slashing funds for community projects, it’s more important than ever that state lawmakers support these shovel-ready projects,” said Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, who chairs the Senate Capital Investment committee. 
There’s another reason lawmakers may feel more pressure to pass a bonding bill immediately: Congressional Republicans are considering changes to tax law that would cause interest rates on bonds to rise significantly, making infrastructure projects more expensive to finance.
Historically, the Minnesota Legislature passed a budget in odd-numbered years and a bonding bill in even-numbered years, but lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a bonding bill in 2024. 
The DFL-controlled Legislature passed a $2.6 billion infrastructure package in the 2023 session, including $1.5 billion in bonds, following three legislative sessions without an infrastructure deal.
Pappas said the inconsistency in passing bonding bills has created a backlog in the list of projects; water and sewer plants across the state are aging out at the same time, she said. 
Labor unions back the bonding bill because it would create new jobs for blue collar workers; cities want the bonding bill to pass because they rely on state funds to complete local projects.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/infrastructure-1024x698-1.jpg,,,2025-04-03 14:07:15.589359

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The rehabilitation of female inmates in North Dakota took a large step forward Wednesday as state officials celebrated the groundbreaking of the first prison in state history designed to house women.
The new Heart River Correctional Center in Mandan will be more than 191,500 square feet and includes space for 304 beds. The project is expected to cost $166.8 million and be complete in fall of 2027.
Gov. Kelly Armstong and other state officials joined Colby Braun, director of the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and Warden Connie Hackman Rivinius for an event that included women who are in custody.
“Today, we take another step toward a justice system that not only ensures public safety, but also provides opportunities for rehabilitation and second chances,” Hackman Rivinius said. “This project represents more than just walls and infrastructure. It symbolizes the commitment to dignity, safety and the possibility of change.”
In 2021, the department shifted some inmates from the primary women’s prison in New England to the Heart River campus in Mandan. More than 50 women now occupy two residence cottages at the site, which also houses a separate juvenile detention center. 
The new facility will give female inmates access to more employment and educational services, Braun said.
“It’s about making sure they are supported to leave so they don’t come back again,” Braun said. “This is that beginning stage.”

Lucila Madrigal, one of the women at Heart River, said having staff take an interest in her has made her a better person.
“It makes me want to follow the example they lead, strive to be the best version of myself, be a working member of society and hopefully be a role model for others like me one day,” Madrigal said.
The new women’s prison has been the subject of discussion and division among lawmakers during the legislative session. A bill that would allow the department to begin developing policies for female inmates to have their newborn babies live with them for up to 18 months passed the Senate on a 28-18 vote and the House on a 48-42 vote. 
Armstrong announced Wednesday he signed that bill, leading to cheers from the female inmates of Heart River Correctional Center in attendance. 
“Being tough on crime doesn’t work,” he said. Armstrong added holding serious offenders accountable is important, but funding for rehabilitation and addressing overcrowding is also a priority.
He said it is the state’s solemn responsibility to give the best care and rehabilitation possible to inmates under their care so they can be better citizens once they leave.
“A good criminal justice system holds people accountable, but it gives them grace and it gives them hope,” said Armstrong, a former criminal defense attorney. “We don’t criminalize people. We criminalize conduct and that is why lady justice is blind. That is why facilities like this matter.”
Braun said many inmates have been through traumatic events, battle addiction issues or may deal with mental health concerns, which is why he believes the prison needs to be a place of restoration.
“It’s about the vocational piece. It’s about learning those skills and it’s all the services around,” Braun said. “Really, this is so much more than just a bed.”
He added the road to the new women’s prison has taken about 40 years, beginning with a single female unit at the State Penitentiary in the 1980s. Prior to that unit, North Dakota contracted with other states to house female inmates.
Later women were housed on a floor of the James River Correctional Center in Jamestown. Lawmakers decided in the 2003 session that female prisoners needed a dedicated facility, which led to the department renovating the former St. Mary’s Catholic School in New England.
“We just turned some doors into locked prison doors and beyond that it was really just using that exact same foundation that was laid out for kids,” said Braun, who was the warden in New England from 2004 to 2010.
The New England facility is still the primary intake point for female inmates. After the new complex opens, the site may shift its focus more toward rehabilitation and minimum security beds, Braun said.
During the 2023 legislative session, lawmakers approved $131.2 million for the Heart River Correctional Center. The remaining $35.6 million is under consideration by the House Appropriations Committee after passing the Senate unanimously in February.
Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby, said female inmates needed to be closer to services that they couldn’t get in rural southwestern North Dakota. The women will be able to use some of the same services that men receive at the State Penitentiary, which lawmakers hope will lead to better outcomes and lower recidivism, he said.
“New England did the job that it was intended to do,” Nelson said. “Treatment is such a big part of the rehabilitation process and finding treatment personnel in that region is difficult.”

(Screenshot from NCGA video feed)The state pension system has a $16 billion deficit, state Treasurer Brad Briner told a legislative committee Thursday morning, and the department’s investment division needs a new strategic direction. 
Briner used his appearance before the House Oversight Committee to talk up his proposal for changing how investment decisions are made. 
He also faced pointed questions from Democrats on the committee about potential crypto investments. 
A bill moving through the state House, one backed by House Speaker Destin Hall, would allow the Treasurer’s office to invest in Bitcoin.
Right now, the state Treasurer makes all the investment decisions. The office has investment advisory boards, but the Treasurer doesn’t have to listen to them. 
Briner wants the state to create a board, called the Investment Authority, that would make investment decisions. His proposal is in House Bill 506 and its Senate twin, Senate Bill 709. The Treasurer would sit on the board with appointees from the House Speaker, the Senate leader, the Governor and the Treasurer. Members would have a minimum of 10 years’ experience in investment management. 
Coincidentally, Briner’s committee appearance coincided with a sharp drop in stock market indexes triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariffs. 
“Today is going to be a very interesting day in U.S. capital markets history,” he said. “The temptation for everyone is to do something, anything,” Briner said. “The right answer is probably going to be to wait.”
For a political office holder, the temptation is greater, he said. Having an investment board would be a guard against that temptation and still provide political accountability, he said. 
North Carolina is one of three states where one person is responsible for investment decisions, he said. 
“I think more heads are better than one when it comes to having a disciplined, long-term investment strategy,” he said. “I think having this kind of concentrated power in a single individual, elected or otherwise, doesn’t really make sense.”
Former Treasurer Dale Folwell had an unorthodox approach to investing that was out of step with other large public pension funds, NC Newsline has reported. The pension fund held a far greater percentage of its money in cash than other public pension plans, which was a drag on returns.
Pension investments have fallen short of the 6.5% rate of return, Briner said, and the state pension fund ranks 49th or 50th in returns. 
With a sole fiduciary, “it is easy to be overly conservative in that model, and hard to be appropriately risky in that model, because you get all of the blame, and you get none of the credit. And I understand from a human emotion perspective why you’d end up where we are, and that’s not a good place.”
Democrats on the committee asked repeated questions about investments in crypto currency. Rep. Allison Dahle (D-Wake) said constituents are wondering about it. 
Briner said Bitcoin is “the best method to bet against the value of the U.S. dollar” but it’s also extremely volatile. 
“There probably is a role for them over time in a very modest proportion,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-03-at-10.03.02-AM-1024x545.png,,,2025-04-03 14:07:15.589359

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)The LSU athletic department is not subject to budget belt-tightening measures the university announced for all departments last week amid an uncertain fiscal outlook, a school spokesman said. 
LSU President William Tate announced last week the university would withhold 2% of each department’s budget, with 75% of that money going to a fund to support academic and research initiatives. This won’t apply to the athletic department , LSU spokesman Todd Woodward said in a statement to the Illuminator and Tiger Rag, because it is considered an auxiliary to the university. 
During difficult budget times for the university in the past, LSU’s athletic department has transferred money to the university. After Gov. Bobby Jindal slashed the state budget, the athletic department began making annual transfers. 
The school received tens of millions of dollars from its sports programs from 2012-19, when athletic director Scott Woodward ended the practice shortly after he took the job. 
“It’s something that’s very dangerous, when universities rely on recurring money, especially from an auxiliary like the athletic department,” Woodward told Tiger Rag in 2019. “So no, I think, while I will always support the university in some form or fashion, we can not sustain what we’re currently doing.”
As the rest of the university gets ready for cutbacks, Todd Woodward — no relation to the athletic director — said the university is not asking for help from athletics. 
Universities, particularly research institutions such as LSU, are bracing for tough times as the Trump administration makes dramatic reductions to agencies that fund research on college campuses and at their affiliated medical schools and research institutions. Many of these cuts are on pause, pending the outcome of litigation. 
LSU spent $488 million on research in fiscal year 2023, the most recent period for which data is available. Most of that money came from federal grants. 
LSU could lose $12 million if Trump’s proposed cut to indirect cost reimbursements for National Institutes of Health grants are allowed to go into effect, and it would lose tens of millions more if other agencies followed suit.

Even if the athletic department was asked for help, its currently strained fiscal position could make that difficult. 
LSU’s sports programs collectively operated at a deficit in fiscal year 2024, according to a Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report. It’s the third year in a row the athletic department finished the business year in the red.
The department is currently in a hiring freeze because of its budget constraints. 
“I would certainly hope that moving forward, if they do have surplus in their budget, that they would want to support the academic side of campus as they have in the past,” LSU Faculty Senate President Dan Tirone said in an interview. 
“I think that athletics has some questions about their own financial status at the moment, given some of the changes with the NCAA and some of the obligations they may be taking on,” he added. 
College athletic departments anticipate increased expenses as they prepare to start sharing revenue with student athletes. Starting next fiscal year, LSU has to find approximately $20 million more to share with its athletes. 
LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell declined to make an athletics official available to discuss the department’s budget. 
Most major athletic programs are expected to pay the full amount allowed under a settlement in the federal case, House v. NCAA, in which former college athletes sued the athletic association over rules that prevented them from profiting on their names, images and likenesses (NIL). 
The proposed settlement, which is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, will require schools to share athletic revenue of up to $22 million. It also requires the NCAA to provide back pay to former athletes who competed before it allowed NIL payments.
This increase in expenditures for major programs such as LSU could mean fewer handouts to struggling universities, sports administration scholars say. 
“Anytime a department – athletics or otherwise – is helping out the broader university, it’s usually because of some sort of marginal budget,” said Adam Cook, a sports administration lecturer at Northwestern University. 
Steven Rackley, a sport management professor at Rice University and a longtime former athletic director, said in an interview the cost of revenue sharing hitting at the same time as proposed federal funding cuts for higher education will force difficult decisions. 
“Presidents and board of trustees, whoever it may be, are going to have to decide how much is athletics worth as opposed to the worth of doing research in academia on campus, and that’s going to be just a tough discussion that those people are going to have to have,” Rackley said. 
The athletic department not pitching in during a difficult budget time could increase the chronic tension between faculty and athletics, which exists at nearly every university, Rackley said. 
“Those are the kind of things that make things challenging, where people look at athletics as being special, or they don’t have to do their part,” he said. “If athletics said, ‘Yeah, we were going to jump in here and do our part,’ I think that would really alleviate some of that [tension] and help bring some people back to supporting athletics.” 
Some universities could be looking to institutional support or student athletic fees to help fill budget gaps. 
LSU currently does not have a student fee supporting athletics, although other Southeastern Conference schools do, including Auburn, Georgia and Ole Miss. Their athletic departments bring in millions from these fees, according to data from the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database. With an annual collection of almost $7 million, Auburn brings in the most in the SEC in student fees.  
Seeking a student fee for athletics at LSU would come with its own complications. The university has increased tuition for certain high-cost programs, and state lawmakers are considering legislation that could decrease how much state financial aid LSU students receive.

Andy Beshear at Beshear's Thursday press conference. (Screenshot)Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services Secretary Eric Friedlander will retire Aug. 1, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Thursday. 
Kentucky Public Health Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack will succeed him as CHFS secretary. 
The sprawling cabinet has a broad range of health and social services duties, from protecting children and vulnerable adults to administering the Medicaid program and inspecting nursing homes. It oversees billions of dollars in state and federal spending.
Speaking of the two men, Beshear said “their level of service goes beyond mere professionalism.” He praised them for “living out their values at the highest level, selflessly serving all of our neighbors.” 
Both Stack and Friedlander were instrumental in guiding Kentucky through the COVID-19 pandemic and pushing back against vaccine misinformation. 
“It has been an honor to serve,” Friedlander said during Beshear’s weekly press conference. 
He also said his job over the last few years would have been more difficult “if we didn’t have a governor that actually believed in science.” 
Stack echoed that, thanking Beshear for supporting “me in being able to be factual and straight with the people of Kentucky.” 
“It feels now that we’re entering a third act with all sorts of challenges coming from the federal government,” Stack said. “Public health and health and family services is essential to ensuring that we have healthier people and healthier communities. If we fail to invest in these services and supports to ensure that all of us have the opportunity to thrive, we will all be worse off for it.” 
Beshear said the choice of Stack’s replacement will be “collaborative.” 
Friedlander has been in his current role since 2020, though he’s worked in the cabinet for about four decades. He formerly worked as chief resiliency officer for the Louisville government.

Legislative Bill 22, from State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, passed 47-0. It expands on Dungan’s “Nebraska Prenatal Plus Program” in 2024 that offers services to Medicaid-eligible mothers to help prevent low birth weights, preterm births and adverse birth outcomes. Dungan said the bill represents “another step forward in ensuring that we have healthy moms and healthy babies in Nebraska.”
“This program will give an opportunity, do those who want it, to have nurse visiting to ensure postpartum care and reduce adverse birth outcomes all across the state,” Dungan said. “People should have access to this care no matter their background or where they live in the state.”
  State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln. July 29, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Dungan’s 2025 legislation, which heads to Gov. Jim Pillen, would expand care to include voluntary targeted case management for evidence-based nurse home visitation services, similar to the Family Connects program in Lincoln and Lancaster County and now being piloted in Omaha.
The goal is to expand the program statewide, deploying a nurse to the homes of eligible postpartum mothers and children six months of age or younger for one-on-one services.
Families would be allowed to decline home visitation services at any time. 
Defining ‘home visitations’
LB 22 also passed with LB 104 from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, which helps define home visitations and what they cover.
LB 104 lays the groundwork for a potentially more expansive visitation program in the future, primarily in the homes of families with one or more children, who are 5 years old or younger, or expecting parents.
Raybould’s language requires the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to only fund a program if it includes periodic home visits meant to improve the health, well-being and self-sufficiency of parents and their children. Such a program could include nurses, social workers or other early childhood and health professionals.

The approved home visitation program would need to accomplish at least one of the following:

Improve maternal, infant or child health outcomes, including reducing preterm births.
Promote positive parenting practices.
Build healthy parent and child relationships.
Enhance social and emotional development.
Support cognitive development.
Improve the health and well-being of the family.
Empower families toward economic self-sufficiency.
Reduce child maltreatment and injury.
Increase school readiness.

To receive state or federal funding, programs must be founded on a clear and consistent methodology, associated with or certified by a credible organization, have comprehensive standards to ensure high quality and continuous services and employ well-trained and culturally competent staff, among others.
DHHS would be required to submit three related annual reports, beginning Feb. 15, 2026.
“They give confidence to a lot of new parents and they have evidence-based support showing that they do make a difference in helping families get adjusted to being new parents an being the best parents that you can possibly be,” Raybould, a former member of the Lincoln City Council and Lancaster Board of Commissioners, said.
340B Contract Pharmacy Protection Act
LB 168, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, also passed 42-5 on Thursday. It would prohibit 340B Program drug manufacturers from interfering with or denying sales of such drugs to hospitals, clinics or pharmacies that manufacturers contract with. The federal program requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts to eligible entities caring for uninsured or low-income patients in exchange for their participation in Medicaid and Medicare. No federal or state tax dollars are used for the program.
  State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. Jan. 9, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hardin’s bill, and others like it in other states, was criticized by a political action committee backed by Trump adviser Elon Musk. Republican lawmakers were criticized as “undermining Trump” and funding “gender transitions for kids, abortion procedures and health care for illegals.” 
Hardin, who chairs the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, has said the claims have no truth. Nebraska lawmakers prohibited gender transition surgeries for minors, restricted gender transition medications and limited abortion procedures in 2023, with Hardin’s approval.
Hardin thanked his fellow senators for valuing the “life-saving work” from the 58 hospitals in the state that benefit from the congressional program, which he said is “paid for by Big Pharma.”
“Hospitals from Kimball to UNMC [the University of Nebraska Medical Center] greatly benefit from this program!” Hardin said in a text. “Good for Nebraska!!”
Other passed legislation
Among other bills passed Thursday:

LB 7, from State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, would clarify that Native American tribes are not foreign governments for purposes of the Foreign-Owned Real-Estate National Security Act. DeKay passed the law in 2024, at Pillen’s request, to prohibit foreign adversaries from purchasing land in the state. Approved 47-0.


LB 41, from State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, would expand blood testing for pregnant women to check for syphilis from one screening during the first trimester to also include testing in the third trimester and at birth. Testing would be voluntary. Approved 47-0.


LB 105, from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, would allow public power districts to split voting precincts when crafting subdivisions, without regard to population, “if in the opinion of the Power Review Board the district boundaries do not prejudice the interests of electric consumers.” District lines must currently follow precinct or county lines or contain substantially equal populations, meaning some voters are excluded from their local power district. Approved 46-1.


LB 143, from State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, would require that military families be able to get preliminary or advanced enrollment for their children regardless if they have an individualized education program, individualized family service plan or Section 504 special accommodations, or receive special education. Approved 47-0.


LB 195, from State Sen. Glen Meyer of Pender, would provide health professionals immunity for the prescription, administration or dispensing of any generic opioid overdose reversal medications, not just Naloxone. Approved 47-0.


LB 248, from State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, would exempt child care programs on a military base or federal property or a facility licensed by a branch of the U.S. Department of Defense or U.S. Coast Guard from needing to be separately licensed in Nebraska. Approved 47-0.


LB 312, from State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney, would allow nurse anesthetists to qualify for student loans or student loan repayment under the Rural Health Systems and Professional Incentive Act. Approved 46-1.


LB 501, also by Meyer, would expand a state program that allows properties to be reassessed after they are destroyed (such as after a natural disaster) for property tax purposes to include all damages not caused by the owner. Property owners could apply for a reassessment if damage meets or exceeds 20% of the land’s assessed value and is before July 1 of the same year. The current law, from former State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard, passed in 2019. Approved 47-0.

(Getty Images)A strategic plan released last month made dozens of recommendations for strengthening the state’s food system.
It painted a challenging picture for New Hampshire’s estimated 4,000 farms, which “rarely operate in a way that provides enough income for the farm family,” the plan said. And the pressures are growing, with agriculture sales decreasing 12.6% from 2017 to 2022, it said.
“The data demonstrates that we need to adjust our collective work to create a stronger local food system by centering the financial viability of farming, fishing, and food production in New Hampshire,” the plan reads.
The plan was created by the NH Food Alliance, a network based out of the University of New Hampshire Sustainability Institute that worked in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food and others. It was supported by funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program, as well as the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation.
While the plan noted that different types of producers face different problems, it also pointed out common struggles, like the loss of 80% of the state’s farmland over the past 60 years, New Hampshire’s “shortage of affordable housing,” increased environmental pressures from climate change, and more.
At the same time, the plan pitched the benefits and opportunities of looking local when it comes to agriculture: “regional food security, economic stability for farmers, fishermen, and food producers, regional economic growth, protected open spaces, a stable food supply, climate resilience, and improved public health and nutrition.”
The plan engaged 118 subject matter experts in developing 27 briefs across a range of topics including agritourism, dairy, fruits and vegetables, consumer education, disaster relief, farmland conservation, and more. 
In the end, the plan issued 143 recommendations tied to each of the briefs. For the state’s “rapidly” dwindling dairy farms, for instance, it called for measures like creating an association to advocate for the state’s dairy industry, bolstering workforce development, and offering more grant support.
The plan was spurred by the NH Food Alliance’s participation in the New England Food System Planners Partnership, which aims for New Englanders to consume 30% regional food products by 2030, according to a news release from UNH. An analysis from the partnership found that only 3.2% of Granite Staters’ spending on food, beverages, and alcohol in 2022 went to regional sources.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dairyfarms-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 14:07:15.589359

(Governor's office photo by Dana DiFilippo)Former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac will be on June’s GOP primary ballot despite legal claims by one of his rivals that Kranjac did not file enough signatures from eligible voters to stay in the race, Secretary of State Tahesha Way said Thursday.
Way, who is also lieutenant governor, agreed with an administrative law judge who said Wednesday that Kranjac collected enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Kranjac in a statement attacked the attempt to boot him from the race as equivalent to Democrats’ efforts to keep Donald Trump from running for reelection last year.
“I never thought ‘Republicans’ would try to use the same left-wing lawfare tactics popularized by Adam Schiff on me and my supporters in this gubernatorial primary,” Kranjac said in a statement.
Schiff is an anti-Trump U.S. senator from California.
Way had until noon Thursday to certify candidates for June’s primary
The effort to keep Kranjac out of June’s primary was launched by the campaign for Republican Bill Spadea, a former New Jersey 101.5 host who is also seeking to become our next governor. The primary is June 10 (six Democrats are vying for their party’s nomination).
Candidates for governor must submit petitions with signatures from 2,500 registered voters. Spadea’s team said Kranjac’s signatures included some from voters who are not Republicans and that some of the people who circulated the petitions from Kranjac’s campaign should have been registered as Republicans at the time (they were unaffiliated and later registered with the GOP).
During marathon sessions Monday and Tuesday before a judge, hundreds of Kranjac’s signatures were deemed ineligible. Way said after this process, about 2,600 valid signatures remained.
Spadea and Kranjac are both seeking the GOP nod for governor by labeling themselves as the most pro-Trump candidate. Kranjac often touts the Star-Ledger’s coverage of him as the “Trumpy mayor” of Englewood Cliffs, while Spadea long championed Trump’s policies while he hosted his morning radio show.
In his statement, Kranjac took direct aim at Spadea, calling his case “fake and fraudulent.”
“Other opponents should take notice: I’m in this race to win,” Kranjac said.
A spokesman for the Spadea campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Burlington County contractor Justin Barbera, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli round out the Republican field.
Twenty-one Assembly candidates also saw their petitions challenged. Of those, seven were removed from the ballot and one had their case remanded to the Office of Administrative Law. The remaining 13 were deemed eligible for the ballot.

(Photo by Marcio Silva/ Getty Images)When the Boston Red Sox step onto the field Friday for their first game at Fenway Park this season, members of the Maine House of Representatives will likely be thinking of their friend and former colleague, the late Lois Galgay Reckitt. 
“Somewhere up there, hopefully she’s got a great seat for tomorrow’s home opener,” said Rep. James Thorne (R-Carmel).
Reckitt was a Red Sox fan from the day she was born, said Rep. Matthew Beck (D-South Portland), who was elected to fill the seat Reckitt held when she died in October 2023. She was 78. 
“Everyday I’m here I’m humbled by the knowledge that I’m occupying the seat once held by Lois Reckitt and I know that I will never be able to fully fill her shoes,” Beck said, adding that her generous spirit and forgiving nature was reflected in her ability to be his friend despite his allegiance to the New York Yankees. 
Thursday’s discussion, held on the floor of the Maine House of Representatives, was born out of a resolution from Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) to honor Reckitt in celebration of the Red Sox home opener. Regardless of party or team affinity, representatives from across the state took the opportunity to share the ways Reckitt shaped their lives. 
The heartfelt speeches provided a break from what had been a rancorous few weeks in the Maine House. Just over a week ago, multiple Republicans took to the floor to share feelings of broken trust and division between them and their Democratic colleagues fueled by censure votes and contentious budget negotiations that led to a technical adjournment and opening of a special session.
Despite their diverging political views, Henderson said she and Reckitt — a progressive known for championing gender and LGBTQ rights — became kindred spirits in the short time they served in the Legislature together. Henderson described her as the epitome of intellectual integrity and a phenomenal storyteller. 
Reckitt was called a great mentor, a constant, a lion who modeled fairness and integrity. 
“Like baseball, Lois marked the time for all of us,” said Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who shared memories of serving on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee with Reckitt.
During one of his early terms, Rep. Will Tuell (R-East Machias) said a colleague set a challenge to meet five new people every session. The impression was for those to be people outside of one’s caucus. This led to Tuell, a self-described introvert, often chatting with Reckitt over breakfast. 
He described them as friends, but political opposites. They found common ground with the Red Sox, evidenced by Reckitt leaving boxes at Tuell’s seat with bobbleheads of the players she thought he would like, an act he found touching and humbling.
Tuell also said it’s not lost on him that Reckitt was one of the few lawmakers who visited a correctional facility Down East to research legislation introduced about it. Though they didn’t often change each other’s minds when it came to policy, Tuell spoke of the civility and respect they shared. 
“We worked to find common ground when we could and when we couldn’t, life went on, and that’s how it should be in this chamber,” he said. 
Rep. Vicki Doudera (D-Camden) spoke of the regret she has that Reckitt never got to meet her husband, Ed, who died in December. But she also thanked Henderson for putting the resolution forward and evoking happy memories of Reckitt and her husband.
“I hope if there’s a place where kindred spirits align somewhere in the universe, that Lois and Ed are talking about the Green Monster, and the curse of the Bambino, and how that was broken in 2004, and Pesky’s Pole,” Doudera said.

(Getty Images)Several voting rights groups sent a “notice of violation” to the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office and the Indiana Election Division on Wednesday, alleging that a new state law violates the National Voter Registration Act. 
“U.S.-born citizens would not face the same barriers while naturalized citizens would be required to jump through additional hoops to register to vote,” said Julia Vaughn, the executive director of Common Cause Indiana in a Thursday release. “Indiana already struggles with low voter turnout — it doesn’t make sense to impose new barriers.”
The pertinent portion of House Enrolled Act 1264 from 2024 doesn’t go into effect until July 1. It requires the state’s National Voter Registration Act official — in this case, the co-directors of the state’s election division — to “compare the statewide voter registration system with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles list of temporary credentials …” 

Groups signing the letter include: Common Cause Indiana, the League of Women Voters of Indiana, Hoosier Asian American Power, the NAACP Indiana State Conference, the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and attorneys William R. Groth and Daniel Bowman of Bowman & Vlink, LLC.

That official “shall” notify the local county that “the registered voter may not be a citizen of the United States.” The law further dictates that the registered voter must provide proof of citizenship within 30 days of receiving a notice or the county will cancel that registration. 
“The reality is that non-citizens are not voting in our elections and the citizenship check provision of 2024’s HEA 1264 will be harmful for voter access,” said Ami Gandhi, with the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights. 
“By relying on flawed data matching processes that use outdated BMV records, and requiring citizenship verification under tight deadlines, this law increases the risk of wrongful voter purges. This is a violation of the (NVRA) and creates unnecessary hurdles that only naturalized citizens — and no U.S.-born citizens — will have to endure to exercise their right to vote.” 
According to the Secretary of State’s Office, the NVRA had a three-pronged goal: increasing the number of registered eligible voters, protecting the voting process’ integrity and enhancing voter participation. 
But the voting rights groups said it was also meant to protect citizens from “discriminatory and unfair registration laws, particularly those that negatively impact eligible voters from historically marginalized communities.”
“Requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote disproportionately impacts communities of color,” said Sadie Harper-Scott, the president of NAACP Indiana State Conference. “Many eligible voters, including Black people and people of color, may not have access to the documents that are being required in HEA 1264. This will suppress voter participation, not protect democracy.”
Thursday’s press release concludes by saying that if the state fails to respond and correct violations within 90 days, the coalition “may” file a lawsuit.

He added that “unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI.”He did not cite examples in the statement.Trainor said the department “is taking an important step toward ensuring that states understand — and comply with — their existing obligations under civil rights laws and Students v. Harvard.”In the February letter, Trainor offered a wide-ranging interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023 involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.

Free.,States ordered by U.S. Department of Education to certify compliance with school DEI ban,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-ordered-us-department-education-certify-compliance-school-dei-ban,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education demanded in a letter to state education leaders on Thursday that they certify all K-12 schools in their states are complying with an earlier Dear Colleague letter if they want to keep receiving federal financial assistance.The department’s sweeping order gives K-12 state education agencies 10 days to collect the certifications of compliance from local school governing bodies, and then sign them and return them to the federal department.The new demand stems from a February letter threatening to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in admissions, programming, training, hiring, scholarships and other aspects of student life.Craig Trainor, the department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said “federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” in a statement Thursday.“When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal antidiscrimination requirements,” Trainor said. He added that “unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI.”He did not cite examples in the statement.Trainor said the department “is taking an important step toward ensuring that states understand — and comply with — their existing obligations under civil rights laws and Students v. Harvard.”In the February letter, Trainor offered a wide-ranging interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023 involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives approved a $3.7 billion 2026 General Fund budget 95-3 on Thursday morning.
HB 186, sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, is $347 million more than the current budget, about a 10% increase. Black Democrats criticized the budget for cutting appropriations for the Magic City Classic; Birmingham Civil Rights Museum and Jazz Hall of Fame. 
Rep. A.J. McCampbell, D-Linden, said the programs were part of diversity, equity and inclusion and needed to be funded.

“If we don’t bring all of the minds, all of the cultures and all of the people together to work on things that affect all of the people, then we develop things in silos,” McCampbell said.
Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, said a senator held a luncheon at the Jazz Hall of fame last week and wondered what happened in a week to the support of the museum in Birmingham.
“A couple of days later, we find out that the small funds that they would be receiving would be cut,” she said.
The programs get a total of $2.2 million (0.06%) in the current budget. Reynolds told Givan that the programs would be funded through a Senate amendment. He said the budget was run through a computer program that cut one-time appropriations and that he would be willing to add funds back in for programs that needed it.
“When members came to me and asked me to reinsert those, we often did,” Reynolds said. “But nobody had requested that those get put back in there.”
The House version of the budget is about $6 million higher than Gov. Kay Ivey’s proposed budget, filed in February. 
The chamber also adopted a committee amendment that appropriates money for a statue of Helen Keller on the Alabama State Capitol grounds. 
Reynolds also offered a floor amendment that added $425,000 for a Transportation Pilot Program under the Alabama Department of Human Resources. It passed 97-0.
“The $425,000 is for SAFE, Mary Hill Family Services Center and Circle of Care Center for Families,” Reynolds said.
The Alabama Medicaid Agency, which provides health insurance for over 1 million Alabamians, nearly all children, elderly citizens and those with disabilities, will get $1.179 billion from the state, a $223.8 million (19%) increase over this year. Ivey requested $1.184 billion in February, about $5 million than what the House approved. 
The Alabama Department of Corrections, which administers the state prisons, will get a $90.1 million increase (11%) to $826.7 million. 
The Alabama Department of Human Resources, which provides child and adult protective services, enforces child support payments and administers food and family assistance, will get $148.9 million from the state in 2026, a $4.7 million (3%) increase from the current budget. 
The Alabama Department of Mental Health, which provides mental health care services in the state, will get a $4.7 million increase (2%) to $244 million. The Legislature cut the funding from Ivey’s recommendation by $3.7 million.
“Sustainability is always my priority when developing the budget—we must make decisions that the state can afford not only now but, in the future, as well,” Reynolds said in a statement. “While high interest rates are driving revenue growth in state accounts, that will not always be the case, which is why we must continue to approach this process from a fiscally conservative standpoint.”
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, applauded Reynolds and the committee for their work on the budget. 
“Our budgeting process is calculated, transparent, and guided by the principle of not spending every dollar that comes in,” he said in a statement. “I commend Rep. Reynolds and the members of the House for their work in developing the state’s financial plan for 2026 and setting Alabama up for continued success.”
The budget now goes to the Senate.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Seven years ago, we were in a tight spot.
My wife, daughters, and I were sharing a house in central New Hampshire with my parents, and even that frugal living arrangement wasn’t enough to make it affordable for any of us after a while. The property taxes were too high and climbing (even in our tight-fisted red town), the cost of upkeep became prohibitive, and there were too many years of paychecks going in the wrong direction. Amid that tense mess, my dad passed away — of course it was his heart — and my sister and her family ended up selling their place next door and taking over the old house, in part so my mom could stay. We all agreed it was the best option of the few available to our extended clan. Meanwhile, the four of us — the family within the family — found a starter home we felt like we could afford and began again in a new town with new schools for the girls. It wasn’t the softest landing, for any of us.
We were unmoored.
The first year in that new life was tough, and we almost lost everything. My wife and I were both working full time but carrying a lot of credit card debt. The minimum payments combined with the mortgage, utilities, and other standard living expenses left us with nothing at the end of the month. If you didn’t know us, if you weren’t there, it would be as good a guess as any that the debt was a result of us living beyond our means. After all, every family has to live within a budget, and every family needs to learn how to trim the fat.
The thing is, there wasn’t any. The thousands in debt wasn’t the result of vacations; we never took any. It wasn’t for nights on the town or Amazon splurges. It is just how much extra it cost, added up over the first 15 years of our life together, to keep a young family of four afloat in New Hampshire. It was for urgent home and car repairs that we didn’t see coming, school clothes and supplies for the girls, all of those incidental bills that turn ledgers red.
In the end, we felt our only option — after exploring all of them — was to do precisely what the experts say you should not do: We cashed out part of my 401(k) to pay off the debt. For us, the choice amounted to sink now or struggle later. In other words, there was no choice at all.

It is just how much extra it cost, added up over the first 15 years of our life together, to keep a young family of four afloat in New Hampshire. We could sink now or struggle later.			


I’m sharing all of these personal details, and uncomfortably so, not because I think my family’s story is unique but because in most ways it isn’t. In America, it is so very expensive to have nothing. And that is why political debate in this country strikes me as a kind of madness. We have created a system that exerts endless economic pressure on the middle and lower classes, and the big myth is that whoever you perceive to be below you on that class ladder is the primary, and undeserving, beneficiary of your hard work, your taxes, your struggle. But they are not. And I have to believe — or at least hope — that all of you will see that one day, whatever political party you support.
The whole of the American political establishment — long owned by the actual beneficiaries of that downward economic pressure — serves as the architect for the grand illusion. But the American right takes the cake — has long taken the cake — for subterfuge and misdirection, and it’s a bitter bite.
In this state, they say:
Don’t ask about the $1.17 billion in lost tax revenue for New Hampshire due to all those ill-advised business tax cuts. The real problem is the transgender women and girls entering our public bathrooms and playing on our school soccer fields.
How can you talk about the N.H. GOP’s repeal of the interest and dividends tax in service to the rich, and the loss of another $150 million-plus toward public services, when we are so clearly under attack by murderous migrants?
Sure, your property taxes are high and getting higher, but don’t blame New Hampshire’s aversion to progressive taxation. The problem, you see, is that school districts are spending all of your hard-earned money on smut and critical race theory lessons.
Speaking of schools, pay no mind to how the Republican voucher program is diverting public money to private and religious schools, amid questionable transparency, and adding to the struggles of our beleaguered public schools. But do you know what you should worry about? People who have very little — those ne’er-do-wells enrolled in Medicaid and SNAP — taking advantage of the system. That’s a much bigger deal than billionaires like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg endlessly profiting from a system largely built by and for people just like them.

And don’t worry: Those forever-do-wells will totally have your back once the IRS is too gutted to come after them, environmental regulations no longer stand in the way of their manifest destiny, and the rich-guy tax cuts are extended. The first drops of that multiplied wealth in the top 1 percent might not trickle down to the rest in this lifetime, but just you wait. I mean, if you can’t trust a billionaire and his economic enablers, who can you?
In the years since my wife and I tapped our future to salvage our present, we have never regretted the decision. We’re still here, after all. But the pressure points never go away, and new ones are added. There will be a reckoning when we retire, if we can retire, and the debt pattern is repeating with our daughters through no fault of their own. We worry, constantly, about college costs (even for in-state tuition), the extremely high price of housing, and the direction of a state whose political majority chases every trumped up political issue that comes down the pike while avoiding or worsening the ones that really matter.
As I said, there is nothing particularly unique about our story, except maybe for one thing: We were lucky. Crazy lucky. We’re still standing because we had a small retirement plan to tap, but one little thing could have sent us reeling again in a heartbeat — a lost job, a health issue, even a major home repair would have done it. Would still do it. And now, with state and federal cuts to services underway, I know that a lot of people just like us are about to feel the crushing weight of that final straw.
Why is it so hard to get by when you’ve done everything right, or tried anyway? Shouldn’t paying the bills be a little easier, just a little bit, in the richest country in the world?
If those questions don’t form the immovable center of our politics, I have no idea what it is we are doing.

The storms left a path of major damage in Fayette, Hardeman and McNairy counties, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA). Crews with National Weather Service Memphis have deployed to Selmer, Tennessee to assess tornado damage.
Residents of West and Middle Tennessee received multiple severe storm, tornado and flood warnings throughout Wednesday night into the early morning hours Thursday. 
State officials warn that “generational flooding” — flooding so severe it happens once a generation or once a lifetime  — continues to pose a threat to multiple counties in Middle and West Tennessee as multiple rounds of heavy rain are forecast to stretch into Sunday. 
Rain totals could reach at least 10 inches in areas of West Tennessee north of Interstate 40 by the end of the weekend, according to National Weather Service Memphis. The northwest corner of the state could see up to 15 total inches of rain.
Gov. Bill Lee requested an Emergency Declaration for Tennessee and TEMA Director Patrick Sheehan issued a State of Emergency Wednesday evening in anticipation of the severe storms and flooding. 
Lee’s request includes federal assistance for debris removal, emergency protective measures and direct federal assistance.
President Donald Trump approved Lee’s request around 11 a.m. Thursday, making FEMA assistance available to all 95 Tennessee counties. Under the declaration, FEMA can provide equipment and resources to support emergency response, and direct federal assistance under the public assistance program will be provided at 75% federal funding, according to the agency.
The state remains under a level 3 State of Emergency status, which allows state resources to support local requests for assistance following severe weather while continuing to provide support for ongoing Tropical Storm Helene recovery efforts in East Tennessee.
Five deaths, multiple injuries reported
At least five people have been reported dead, state and local officials confirmed.
The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed one death each in McNairy County, Obion County and Carroll County.
A 48-year-old man was pronounced dead in Fayette County around 2 a.m. Thursday after the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office responded to a call reporting a tornado had overturned a modular home, according to the Fayette County Emergency Management Agency.
Four other family members were transported to a nearby hospital, two in critical condition and two in stable condition. The man’s 16-year-old daughter later died at the hospital, the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office confirmed.
Tornado damage assessments begin
NWS Memphis does not yet have an exact number of confirmed tornadoes from Thursday morning’s severe weather event.
Teams are assessing tornado damage in Selmer, Tennessee and Lake City, Arkansas to confirm and classify the strength of tornadoes, according to NWS Memphis.
The agency received additional reports of tornados in the region from spotters and radar but crews have not yet been able to survey damage or confirm.
Tennessee Highway Patrol deployed a strike team to McNairy County to support local officials, according to TEMA.
“My heart breaks for our city and county at this time,” Selmer Mayor Sherry Inman stated in a social media post expressing gratitude for those who have offered assistance or prayers. “Please continue to pray for all the families and homes that have been lost.”
State officials report power outages, roads blocked by water or debris
More than 15,400 power outages were reported across Tennessee as of 4 a.m. Thursday, according to TEMA, including 6,200 outages in Shelby County.
Multiple roads throughout Middle and West Tennessee have been impacted by downed trees and power lines and flooding, according to the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT). Crews are working to clean up debris. 
Excessive rainfall to come
Excessive rainfall is expected to continue Thursday with the “bullseye” of enhanced risk storms encompassing most of West Tennessee from Memphis to Clarksville along Interstate 40. Widespread flash floods are expected, according to NWS Memphis.
Slight risk rain is forecast for Memphis on Friday, with marginal rain expected from Jackson, Tennessee down to Northern Mississippi.
Heavy rain is expected to return to the Memphis area and along Interstate 40 on Saturday.
This is a developing story.

Whether the General Assembly passes the bill, known as Senate Bill 370, may ultimately be a moot point. The state courts are currently considering a case that could also bring an end to certificate of need laws in North Carolina at the direction of the state Supreme Court, which in October wrote that the lawsuit’s allegations “could render the Certificate of Need law unconstitutional in all its applications.”
Currently, 35 states require health care providers to complete the certificate of need process before creating certain new offerings. In North Carolina, that process is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services with the aim of restricting “unnecessary increases in health care costs” and “unnecessary health services and facilities based on geographic, demographic and economic consideration.”
The North Carolina Healthcare Association, which represents hospitals, supports the practice, writing in a 2024 policy brief that the program “ensures that hospitals and health systems maintain the resources to provide high-value care to all.”
Proponents of certificate of need laws say they prevent unnecessary expenses on new medical facilities and services that would be underutilized and whose costs would ultimately be passed down to patients. Opponents say that in practice, the program impedes vital health care expansion and forces patients to shoulder the cost of millions in consulting and legal fees that hospitals pay to navigate the certificate of need process.
Sen. Benton Sawrey (R-Johnston), one of the repeal bill’s primary sponsors, criticized the certificate of need process as “anticompetitive,” arguing that by allowing the market to decide where new facilities and services are necessary, patients will be better off and will be able to pay less for medical services.
“Ironically, a government program originally aimed at reducing health care prices is likely inflating them, at least in some situations,” Sawrey said. “I think we can be proactive about this decision, but it requires a willingness to have that discussion rather than fall back time and again on the same entrenched positions that don’t work, don’t control costs, and don’t let innovation occur in North Carolina’s healthcare space.”
Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett), a longtime hospital board member, called the change “long overdue” and said in his experience, the process to receive a certificate of need takes a minimum of two years and $500,000 in legal fees.
“We could do not any cancer treatments in Harnett County up until this past year,” Burgin said. “We went through the CON process in the years, but it took six years — really eight, if you add the work-up to it — from the time we started talking about it.”
Tim Rogers, CEO of the Association for Home and Hospice Care of North Carolina, said during public comment that his group believes the certificate of need law “plays a vital role in ensuring the integrity, quality, and accessibility of this vital service.”
“The CON process helps prevent fraud, waste, and abuse by ensuring that new providers entering into North Carolina meet rigorous regulatory and financial standards before entering the market,” Rogers said. “This screening reduces the risk of bad actors, exploiting Medicare and Medicaid, safeguarding taxpayer dollars while ethical business practices are held.”
Cody Hand, a lobbyist with the North Carolina Radiation Oncology Society, said that linear accelerators, like those Burgin said were held up by the CON process in Harnett County, require such careful review because they emit ionizing radiation and so are classified as nuclear technology.
“They require strict safety protocols that in this state don’t exist outside of the CON process,” Hand said. “The CON process serves as a critical checkpoint in both the safety and the staffing, not necessarily for cost control and not necessarily for planning, but for safety and accountability.”
After passing the Health Care committee Wednesday, the bill received a favorable recommendation from the Senate Rules Committee Thursday morning.

According to Nessel’s office, Michigan’s energy companies can only request rate increases once every 12 months, measured from the day they file their application. Friday’s announcement comes 364 days after the company’s prior announcement. The office further noted that Consumers’ notice, filed Friday, comes one week before their latest 2.8% rate increase is set to take effect. 
“By allowing Consumers Energy and DTE to file a new rate hike every twelve months, the State is allowing these billion-dollar businesses to ask for more and more before anyone can even gauge the impact of the previous rate hike,” Nessel said in a statement. “Meaning they’re back asking for more money before anybody knows if their proposed investments made any difference in reliability or affordability for customers.”
Both Consumers Energy and DTE have faced criticism and scrutiny over high electricity rates and poor reliability, with Michigan ranking 9th in the nation in the average number of outage minutes per customer, while facing the 14th highest energy cost burden.
Though Consumers Energy has not indicated how much it aims to raise its rates, Nessel’s office noted the company previously requested an 8.2% increase in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023. The company sells electricity to approximately 1.9 million customers throughout Michigan and natural gas to 1.8 million customers across the state.
“Consumers Energy just got the green-light to raise electric rates, and one week later they’re back with their hands out before putting any of their new earnings to work for their customers,” Nessel said. “My office will continue to hold Consumers Energy and DTE accountable before the Commission, and expose again and again the unjustifiable costs they try, perennially, to foist upon their bill-paying customers.”
Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers Energy said Nessel was wrong on the facts, and that her statement was misleading. 
“Consumers Energy has told state regulators we intend to file a rate request no sooner than June 2. We have not made an actual request,” Carey said, with the notice stating the company expects to file its application on or after June 2, 2025.
“As a note, we are required to file the notice following the implementation of the 2016 Energy Law — this is not a new development,” Carey said.

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.










There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.

Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
‘None of them are equitable’
In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”

Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
Economic anchors
There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.

Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”

For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.

The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

(David Montgomery/Stateline)WATER VALLEY, Texas — On a recent day when the wind gusted close to 40 miles per hour, 82-year-old George Neill was making repairs on his ranch, oblivious to the nearby cluster of wind turbines churning the sky behind him.
“After about a year, you never know the things are here,” said Neill, who leases part of his West Texas property to an East Coast-based renewable energy company that placed three wind turbines on it four years ago.
Hundreds of other wind turbines stretch across this landscape, instantly visible to motorists traveling to nearby San Angelo and other towns. The turbines aren’t the only renewable energy producers amid the mesas: From a distance, a glistening array of solar panels resembles a small lake.
Texas is famous for producing oil and gas, but renewable energy has become deeply embedded in the state’s culture and economy. Texas led the nation in generating electricity from wind power and utility-scale solar power in 2023, and wind and solar energy projects contribute tax revenue to local governments and struggling school districts. Texas landowners are expected to receive nearly $30 billion in lease payments under current and expected projects, according to an industry study.
But in recent years, Texas has loosened its political embrace of alternative energy. For the second legislative session in a row, many Texas lawmakers are trying to derail or curb future renewable energy projects.













They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.


– Joshua Rhodes, research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin





The shift is rooted in a number of a factors, including the second Trump administration’s antipathy toward renewables and an aggressive recommitment to fossil fuels in Texas energy policy. There is lingering concern over the reliability of the state’s electrical grid, after all types of power sources failed during a devastating 2021 winter storm. Some people object to the aesthetics of wind and solar farms, or note that turbines and panels can harm some wildlife.
Texas is not alone. Once focused on stopping individual projects at the local level, renewable energy opponents have been making inroads in other state legislatures, too. They have received backing from the oil and gas industry. And they’ve been galvanized by the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest-ever attempt to speed the transition to clean energy.
In neighboring Oklahoma, for example, hundreds of people rallied at the state Capitol in January to urge Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order halting new wind and solar projects. Like Texas, Oklahoma is a major oil and natural gas producer, but it generated 45% of its total in-state electricity from renewable resources in 2023.
Stitt, a strong supporter of renewable energy, is highly unlikely to issue such an order. But he will leave office in two years, and several Republicans discussed as possible successors appeared at the rally. One of them, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, last month on social media criticized what he called “the green energy scam” and urged Stitt and state lawmakers to tighten wind farm rules during the current session.
In Arizona, the House earlier this year approved a bill that would bar wind farm projects within a dozen miles of any property zoned for residential use — a restriction that would apply to about 90% of the land in the state, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.
In Ohio, a 2021 law allowing county commissioners to create restricted areas where utility-scale solar and wind projects can’t be built has had a huge impact, as 26 Ohio counties have banned renewable energy projects. This year, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation that would end all state solar subsidies.
And in Missouri, Republican legislators are pushing a bill that would raise taxes on farmers who lease their land for wind or solar energy projects.
The expanding opposition to renewables isn’t unexpected, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the power grid. He noted that wind, solar and battery storage have rapidly become the “cheapest way to put more energy on the grid.”
“They’re victims of their own success,” he told Stateline. “They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.”
 Opposing sides

At the center of the current debate in Texas is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican committee chair who has resurrected a 2023 bill that would require new utility-scale solar and wind projects to get permits from the state’s Public Utility Commission, regulations that aren’t imposed on projects for natural gas and other energy sources. The bill also calls for set-back requirements and cleanup funds.













The land isn’t just a piece of property to us. It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are.


– Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County, Texas





Kolkhorst, in a statement to Stateline, called the legislation “a common-sense approach to the encroachment of wind and solar facilities being scattered across our great state with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment.”
At an hourslong Senate committee hearing recently where opponents of Kolkhorst’s bill outnumbered supporters, farmers, ranchers and small-town Texans sometimes found themselves on opposite sides, either arguing that sprawling wind farms and solar arrays are a lasting source of economic vitality or a threat to a beloved way of life.
“The land isn’t just a piece of property to us,” said Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County with her husband. “It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are. When we look out across the road, we see rolling green pastures and trees. Now we’re facing the possibility of that view and so much more being replaced by a sprawling solar farm.”
Environmentalists and industry representatives view Kolkhorst’s bill as a roadblock in the march toward green energy. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said the bill would open the door to “a really arbitrary discriminatory permitting regime,” requiring wind and solar developers to get permits that other energy producers do not have to have.
Describing herself as a “lifelong wildlife conservationist,” Kolkhorst said she introduced the bipartisan bill with nine other senators in an effort that “looks past the billions in wind and solar subsidies to instead focus on the total impact of these projects on our land, people and wildlife.”
But oil and gas projects also can harm wildlife, and scientists note that the emissions released by fossil fuels worsen climate change disasters.
Insiders following the legislation, including Metzger, identify one of the bill’s major supporters as Kolkhorst donor Dan Friedkin, a billionaire Houston businessman.
Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, is owner and CEO of The Friedkin Group, a consortium of businesses and investments that includes Gulf States Toyota. Gulf States is one of the world’s largest distributors of Toyota vehicles and parts, with exclusive rights to sell Toyotas in Texas and four other states. Gulf States Toyota Inc. State PAC made four donations totaling $42,500 to Kolkhorst from October of 2020 to October of 2024, according to the Texas Ethics Commission.
Friedkin is a stunt pilot and outdoorsman with a ranch in South Texas. Neither he nor his lobbyist, Laird Doran, senior vice president for public and legal affairs at The Friedkin Group, returned phone calls from Stateline.
Texas lawmakers have filed dozens of wind- and solar-related bills this session, including measures aimed at restricting the placement of battery storage facilities, curbing tax breaks and subsidies for renewable companies and limiting the amount of electricity solar and wind projects contribute to the state’s power grid.
Republican state Sen. Phil King, for example, is pushing a bill that would mandate that 50% of all new electricity must come from natural gas, nuclear or battery storage. King said solar and wind power should be part of the state’s energy mix, but he claims they aren’t reliable enough to serve as the foundation.
State Rep. Don McLaughlin, a Republican, has introduced legislation mandating a study of the economic impact of wind and solar projects on local communities, as well as noise and health effects, threats to wildlife and the challenges of disassembling worn-out systems. Sweetwater, Texas, has thousands of composite blades piled up in “a windmill graveyard.”
 Rural support

But many rural GOP lawmakers whose districts long ago sprouted oil rigs and pump jacks are now strong supporters of wind and solar power.
“It’s nonstop windmills on both side of the road for 70 miles,” said state Rep. John Smithee of Amarillo, describing a typical drive from his hometown in the Texas Panhandle to the Capitol in Austin. “Almost all of those [constituents] have benefited.”
State Rep. Drew Darby, whose northwest Texas district includes San Angelo and Water Valley, an unincorporated community of around 300, said revenue from wind power has resulted in countywide improvements and lease payments to property owners.
“It’s been a positive impact on rural effectiveness,” said Darby. “Landowners … are receiving nice payments for leasing the property.”
In Water Valley, taxes from the increased revenue paved the way for a tax-free bond election that enabled the town’s K-12 school to add an upscale weight room, a technical educational facility and a “cafetorium” that serves as a dining room and performance hall. The school building had previously been so small that students had to eat in shifts.
The wind farm is expected to generate $123 million in local taxes over the 30-year life of the project, as well as more than $100 million in payments to landowners.
George Neill, the West Texas rancher, said he takes the wind turbines in stride as he roams across his 1,700-acre spread.
He’s not at liberty to reveal the amount of his payments. He’s not getting rich, he said, but the money “makes a difference when you’re trying run a ranch.”

The measure (SB 56), sponsored by Miami Republican Ileana Garcia, would prohibit the injection, release, or dispersion of any means of a chemical, chemical compound, substance, or apparatus into the atmosphere for the purpose of affecting the climate.
Any person or corporation who conducts such geoengineering or weather modification activity would be subject to a third-degree felony charge, with fines up to $100,000. If an aircraft operator or controller commits a third-degree felony, they could be subject to a fine up to $5,000 and up to five years in prison.
“There is a lot of unauthorized activity that is currently not regulated both at a federal and a state level, and this is where we wanted to start,” Garcia told members of the Senate. “This is how we are trying to create a method to the madness by creating a reporting mechanism that starts with complaints to the Department of Environmental Protection [DEP] with complaints and concerns and then also at our local state airports.”
In questions on the Senate floor, Broward County Democrat Tina Polsky asked Garcia how could the DEP accurately investigate such a complaint if the “trail” dissipates in the atmosphere?
Garcia replied that the DEP could coordinate with other agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and “based on certain concerns or certain complaints or certain criteria” could decide what was “worthy” of following up on a more scientific basis.
The Miami Republican acknowledged that there were “conspiracy theories” regarding the issue, and said that while she didn’t want to get political, concerns about geoengineering had accelerated under former President Joe Biden.
“The previous administration … sort of opened up that area of allowing, I would say, apprentices to a certain extent based on a lot of the research that I’d seen or just various companies, various corporations from across the world, to come into our atmosphere and start experimenting with, whether it’s rock weathering, whether it’s solar radiation modification, whether it’s cloud seeding — something as simple as sending up a $30 balloon that you can buy on Amazon with specific chemicals so that you can alter the weather or solar radiation,” she said.
“It seems very concerning to me. I have a problem with people spraying perfume next to me sometimes. Don’t you have a problem with people spraying things into the atmosphere that really have no type of empirical data?”
The measure passed the Senate on a 28-9 vote.
‘Great piece of legislation’
Following the vote, Senate President Ben Albritton praised Garcia for producing a “great piece of legislation.”
Healthy skepticism is important,” he said in a written statement. “People have a right to know what is happening. There’s a lot we don’t know in this field of science and people are rightfully concerned.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on social media a video announcing his support for Garcia’s bill, but slammed the House version (HB 477), sponsored by Pasco County Republican Kevin Steele, saying that it’s “gutted” Garcia’s measure.
“They would actually codify the practice of geoengineering and weather modification,” DeSantis said. “People got a lot of kooky ideas that they can get in and  put things in the atmosphere to block the sun and save us from climate change. We’re not playing that game in Florida.”
Steele’s bill has one more committee to get through before making it to the floor of the House.
Last month, Health & Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a social media post that banning  geoengineering “is a movement every MAHA needs to support.”

Buttitta was one of roughly 200 veterans, VA nurses, union members and others who gathered outside the Durham VA Medical Center on Wednesday to protest the proposed cuts they contend will be catastrophic for patient care at the VA.
“We have to stop this now,” Buttitta said. “You can’t take this sitting down. You gotta’ get up and get out and protest this. Write every elected representative, call them on the phone and tell them you’re mad as you can be about this. This is not right, this is a betrayal.”
President Donald Trump used service members and veterans as “props” during the presidential campaign, then turned his back on them, Buttitta said.
“The first opportunity he [Trump] gets, he starts cutting programs,” Buttitta said. “They start taking their DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] budget and slashing everything to do with the government without doing any kind of research beforehand.”
Big national layoffs
The Trump administration has proposed massive VA layoffs as part of the president’s controversial strategy to streamline the federal government. DOGE is led by tech-billionaire Elon Musk, who weeks ago made a show of wielding a large chainsaw to demonstrate how he planned to cut away at what he contends are rampant fraud and waste in the federal government.
In Asheville last month, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins was adamant that veterans’ “health care and benefits are not being cut.” He acknowledged that 14 or 15 staff members at the Asheville VA were among the 2,400 probationary employees laid off. The layoffs in Asheville included one executive assistant, interior designers and some stock clerks, Collins said.
“Most of that is statutory and that’s not something we’re going to cut in the sense of what’s being said,” said Collins, an Iraq War veteran and former Air Force chaplain.

The proposed staffing cuts come amid recent reports by the VA Office of Inspector General which show severe existing staffing shortages in Veterans Health Administration facilities. In fiscal year 2024, 86% of such facilities reported severe occupational staffing shortages for medical officers and 82% reported severe shortages for nurses, the report said.
Buyer’s remorse?
Meanwhile, Buttitta said some Trump supporters in Craven County have begun to have buyer’s remorse, just months into Trump’s second term. Trump handily won Craven County where Buttitta now lives. The president received 59.6% of the vote compared to 33.5% for former Vice President Kamala Harris.
“Some of those people [Trump supporters] are at the end of their rope and they’re starting to get pissed off because … People voted for Trump and where proud of it, now it’s [support for the president] starting to fall apart around the edges. A lot of people are starting to have second thoughts because it’s starting to hit them where it hurts.”
At the Durham VA, on a day when pollen hung thick in the air, protesters’ chants competed against whirring propellers of a Duke Life Flight helicopter, screaming sirens as ambulances whisked by and the honking horns of passersby showing support for sign-toting veterans, VA staffers and union members.   
Like Buttitta, many service members in attendance said proposed Trump administration budget cuts felt like a betrayal. The cuts, they contend, will make it difficult for VAs across the country to adequately serve military men and women who were willing to risk it all after taking the Oath of Enlistment.

The wrong time for staffing cuts
Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a VA nurse and an officer with National Nurses United (NNU), the country’s largest union and professional association of registered nurses, said Trump administration cuts would reduce VA staffing to 2019 levels at a time when workloads have increased due to the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, which added more than 400,000 veterans to VA health care rolls.
The PACT Act expanded VA health care and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances, including those exposed to burn pits and Agent Orange.
“With the added patients, we can’t survive at 2019 staffing levels,” Patterson-Powell said. “We cannot afford to have anyone cut from the VA because any cuts from the VA system affects patient care because we’re here to give care to veterans, all of us.”
Patterson-Powell said VA staffers were told there were about 17 probationary staffers let go from the Durham VA about two weeks ago. Remaining staffers were not told where the cuts were made, she said. NC Newsline could not independently confirm the Durham layoffs. Public information staff onsite declined to comment about Wednesday’s rally or to answer questions about any cuts that might have taken place.
“It’s almost like a secret, and they have not told us,” Patterson-Powell said, when asked if she knew where the cuts were made.
Patient care jeopardized
Irma Westmoreland, a registered nurse and chair of Veterans Affair for NNU who lives in Augusta, Ga., said patient care will suffer if the proposed staffing cuts are made.
“We are eroding patient care that we can provide to our veterans at a time when patient care is needed and it’s morally reprehensible,” Westmoreland said. “We must address these threats to our VA by naming the root cause … Trump and Elon Musk.”
  Irma Westmoreland (right) holding sign. (Photo: Greg Childress)
Westmoreland said the VA is at a crossroads that will determine its future.
“On the one hand we have successfully brought care to more veterans on an almost unprecedented level,” she said. “On the other hand, just as the VA is struggling to meet that challenge, we’re faced with even deeper cuts with the proposal to lay off more workers.”
MaryBe McMillan, president of the North Carolina State AFL-CIO, said Americans must fight back against VA cuts and others being made across the federal government.
McMillan urged protesters to fight for a system the works for “we the people” instead of a “handful of billionaires.”
“This is a fight for all working people because laying off thousands and thousands of federal workers and cutting essential services affects all of us,” McMillan said. “It impacts veterans, it endangers the safety of our air, our food and transportation systems. It impacts millions of Americans who depend on life-saving programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4173-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 12:18:24.739763

Under current law, school and park zones contain “the area within 300 feet or one city block, whichever distance is greater,” of the school or park property line.
The DFL-sponsored legislation (SF3207/HF2980) would reduce that buffer to 100 feet across the board.
People who possess drugs or attempt to sell them in school or park zones face stiffer penalties under a Drug War-era law aiming to protect children from the harms of drug use. 
In reality, few people ensnared by the law are actually attempting to target kids. Because of the way the law is written, prosecutors can charge people with prohibited zone violations simply for driving past a school incidentally during the course of their day.
In rural Polk County, for instance, a Reformer investigation found that prosecutors have filed prohibited zone charges against people who used drugs inside a home located within a block of a school; a homeless man who walked across a bridge near a park; and a woman who parked her car at an apartment complex within a block of a city park.
Statewide, few prosecutors apply the law this way. Polk County, for instance, is home to just 0.5% of the state population but prosecutors there charge 40% of the state’s prohibited zone violations. 
Although Polk County has successfully defended its use of the statute in appellate courts, defense attorneys have argued it’s a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The uneven application of the law is a driver of the reform effort in the Legislature this year.
“This legislation is the start of a much-needed conversation on reforming drug-free zones in Minnesota to ensure the state has uniformity around criminal penalties,” said Jenny Catchings, a state policy manager with the Justice Action Network, which supports the bill. “This law has been misconstrued — to the point that there are valid reasons to see constitutional rights issues — and Minnesota now has a system of justice-by-geography around drug-free zones, with some counties as notable outliers.”
The reform bill would dramatically shrink the areas defined as school or park zones in Minnesota. The map below, for instance, illustrates how drug-free zones would change in East Grand Forks, the largest city in Polk County.

 
In the map, green areas are parks and plum-colored areas are schools. The regions shaded peach, representing distances of 300 feet or one city block beyond park and school property lines, are also considered drug-free zones under current law. The dark brown outlines show the much smaller extent of those buffers under the proposed law.
In practice, the one-block provision of current law means entire neighborhoods become drug-free zones if a tiny park is located within them, or if a neighborhood abuts the city’s sprawling Greenway: the vast natural area surrounding the Red and Red Lake rivers.
The illustration of drug-free zones under current law should be considered an approximation, as the statutes do not define a “block” for the purposes of calculating the extent of a drug-free zone. State courts have held that for drug-free zones in places with regular street grids, the buffer encompasses all eight blocks surrounding the block a school or park is located on.
But considerable uncertainty remains: What about situations where streets form “blocks” of irregular shape or size? What about cases where parkland, like the East Grand Forks Greenway, extends partially into a block? What happens near the margins of a town, where the distance between two roads can be a quarter mile or more?
Those ambiguities have not been addressed by the courts, meaning an enterprising prosecutor could file drug-free zone charges under any number of edge-case scenarios and try to get a judge to go along with it (Polk County Attorney Greg Widseth did not respond to a request for comment).
The reform bill would eliminate all of that uncertainty, replacing it with an across-the-board 100-foot buffer. But it would still leave the door open to aggressive prosecutions. 
Nothing would stop prosecutors from charging drug-free zone violations for simply driving past a school, as is practice in Polk County. And in a city like East Grand Forks, which is bounded entirely on one side by a large tract of parkland, it would remain impossible to traverse the city without passing through a drug-free zone.
The bill’s odds of passage this year are uncertain, as most legislative committees have a deadline of April 4 to advance bills under consideration. And with a 67-67 House, bills need bipartisan support to reach the necessary 68 votes needed for passage.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-684174078-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-04-03 12:18:24.739763

Michael Flynn’s attempt to reinstate his $50 million defamation claim against Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson over comments linking Flynn to Vladimir Putin and the QAnon conspiracy theory.
“This cause having heretofore been submitted to the Court on jurisdictional briefs and portions of the record deemed necessary to reflect jurisdiction under Article V, Section 3(b), Florida Constitution, and the Court having determined that it should decline to accept jurisdiction, it is ordered that the petition for review is denied,” the court said.
“No motion for rehearing will be entertained by the Court,” the justices added. Signing the order were justices John Couriel, Renatha Francis, Jamie Grosshans, Jorge Labarga, and Meredith Sasso. The decision came down on Wednesday.

“We’re not surprised, given the vast legal weaknesses of this trolling lawfare on their part,” Wilson told the Phoenix by text. “It is gratifying to know that it’s all over.”
The next step, Wilson said, is to seek to recover his legal costs from Flynn. “The process of which started immediately.”
A Sarasota state trial judge had ruled Wilson’s comments were protected by the First Amendment, and the Florida Second District Court of Appeal affirmed, citing the “profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks.”
Flynn briefly served as national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term but was fired for allegedly lying to the FBI and Vice President Mike Pence about discussions with the Russian government before Trump took office.
The alleged defamation arose in part from a Wilson post referring to “Putin employee Mike Flynn.” In 2015, the state-sponsored Russia Today television network paid Flynn $45,000 to speak during a dinner in Moscow; a photo shows Flynn seated next to Putin at the event.
Additionally, Wilson retweeted a social media post by podcaster Jim Stewartson reading, “FYI, Mike Flynn is Q.” Flynn argued that QAnon is a terrorist organization and that the reference was defamatory. However, the trial court record notes that Flynn has used the QAnon slogan, “Where we go one, we go all,” and “WWG1WGA,” and authorized sale of merchandize with those slogans.
Courts rejecting Flynn’s lawsuit cited Florida’s SLAPP law, referring to “strategic lawsuits against public participation.” These are actions designed to intimidate or silence critics.

The U.S. Forest Service announced this week that it will temporarily prohibit commercial picking of huckleberries this summer in Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwestern Washington. 
Commercially picked berries have fueled an entire huckleberry industry, flavoring ice cream, sodas, pies, jams, vodkas and wines – at the expense of Yakama Nation tribal members, as detailed in High Country News’ March feature.
“Huckleberries are a vital cultural and ecological resource, and we must ensure their sustainability for generations to come,” Johanna Kovarik, Gifford Pinchot’s forest supervisor, said in a written statement. “This change allows us to work more closely with tribal governments, and local stakeholders and law enforcement to improve management while reducing conflicts.”
The announcement comes after years of complaints from members of the Ḱamíłpa Band of the Yakama Nation about the agency’s commercial program. Gifford Pinchot is the only national forest that allows large-scale commercial harvest of huckleberries, which are a traditional food for the Yakama Nation and other Pacific Northwest Indigenous peoples. Members of the Yakama Nation have reserved rights under their 1855 treaty with the U.S. government to harvest huckleberries in Gifford Pinchot National Forest. 
“Our elders, I think, are smiling about this,” said Trina Sherwood, a 60-year-old Ḱamíłpa member and food gatherer. 
“It’s like a dream come true,” said Elaine Harvey, 48, who is Sherwood’s niece and also a food gatherer from the Ḱamíłpa Band. Harvey and others in her family have pushed the Forest Service to ban commercial picking for years, which she said has infringed on tribal members’ treaty rights to harvest. Both Harvey and Sherwood hope that the Forest Service will permanently prohibit commercial harvesting. 
Federal officials will conduct an assessment and consult with tribes this year before making any long-term changes to the commercial program. Forest Service officials were not immediately available for an interview.  
Most commercial pickers descend from Vietnamese and Cambodian families who came to the U.S. in the 1970s and found work picking huckleberries for low wages. Pickers sell berries directly to individual commercial huckleberry buyers, who are often small business owners or contractors for wild food companies, like Mikuni Wild Harvest, a Canadian corporation with a distribution center in Tacoma. Those companies then sell to private customers, chefs, wineries and other companies that create huckleberry products. Tillamook Creamery, according to a Forest Service official, buys berries harvested from Gifford Pinchot for the company’s huckleberry ice cream. In its press release, the Forest Service said that commercial pickers take 50,000 to 70,000 gallons of berries from the forest each year.
Huckleberries grow only in the mountains and have resisted Western scientists’ decades-long attempts to cultivate their genes to grow them on farms. That’s why the berries fetch a high price — up to $200 a gallon. Commercial pickers pay either $60 for a two-week permit with a 40-gallon limit, or $105 for a seasonal permit with a 70-gallon limit. Gifford Pinchot sold 928 permits last season, totaling $83,445 in revenue.
During annual meetings with Forest Service officials, Harvey and other Yakama Nation leaders have said that commercial pickers leave few berries for tribal members. They threaten elders, who are mostly women, by blocking roads, picking closely off the same bush and bringing dogs to the fields. Some also damage the shrubs, using illegal rakes to quickly strip berries from the bushes. Tribal members have observed commercial pickers harvesting berries before the commercial season begins in mid-August and encroaching on areas reserved for exclusive tribal harvest. “We’ve always explained it, year after year, that the situation is getting worse,” Harvey said of meetings with agency officials. “There was always the question of, ‘Why do we have to have commercial harvest?’”
In the past, Sherwood could harvest four to six gallons of berries per day. But with the increase in commercial pickers, she’s lucky if she can pick one-and-a-half gallons for herself. “It just has really changed the landscape with all this commercial picking,” she said. “I go back to places where I used to see berries in abundance, and it’s all just taken away.”
The Forest Service cited “sustainability concerns, enforcement challenges and escalating conflicts among harvesters,” as reasons for not issuing commercial permits this season but did not specifically mention the program’s impact on Yakama Nation members’ treaty rights to gather. Drought, habitat loss and invasive species, such as the spotted winged drosophila, a small fruit fly whose larvae have been found inside huckleberries, are also among the agency’s cited concerns.
Harvey and Sherwood want to see more Forest Service officers within the fields this summer to enforce the ban and protect tribal pickers who may face intimidation or harassment from those who oppose the temporary commercial closure. But the Forest Service has struggled to adequately patrol the fields for years, citing a lack of funding. And as the Trump administration has slashed the federal workforce, including Forest Service employees, Harvey worries that the agency won’t be able to increase patrols. “Hopefully people will be safe this summer,” she said.
Harvey was part of a volunteer federal committee appointed under the Biden administration that developed amendments to the Northwest Forest Plan, many of which center on cultural resource management. In those committee meetings, Harvey regularly brought up the impacts that Gifford Pinchot’s commercial huckleberry program has had on her community. “I think that’s when the real push came,” Harvey said, and Forest Service officials started to listen. But federal officials told committee members earlier this month that the agency will likely disband the group. With fewer federal employees, Harvey is concerned about how that will affect the temporary commercial harvesting ban and the Forest Service’s ability to complete the Northwest Forest Plan update.
Sherwood is proud of the efforts over the years by her family, including her niece Elaine Harvey, to advocate for the protection of huckleberries. “It’s always been instilled in us, by our elders, our mothers, our grandmothers,” Sherwood said of speaking up for traditional foods. “We’re very protective of our resources.”
The Ḱamíłpa Band has a long history of defending their treaty rights to gather huckleberries and other traditional foods that have been threatened by Forest Service mismanagement. Ḱamíłpa Chief atway William Yallup established what’s known as the Handshake Agreement in 1932, which reserved part of the berry fields in Gifford Pinchot for exclusive tribal harvest. Nearly 50 years later, Sherwood’s family pushed the Forest Service in the 1980s to allow the Ḱamíłpa Band to reestablish a traditional huckleberry feast in the fields to commence berry season, in late July or early August. Her brother and Ḱamíłpa Chief, atway Fred Ike Sr., worked with Cielo Chief atway Howard Jim, along with elders, including Sherwood’s parents, Moses Dick Sr. and Elsie Billy Dick, to host an annual feast. “We wanted to revitalize that history and recognize it and make sure our presence was known,” Sherwood said. 
She now helps organize the feast with Harvey and other family members, gathering berries and enough food to feed the longhouse for a few days. Her grandmother, atway Susie Walsey Billy, lived for weeks at Sawtooth Mountain in Gifford Pinchot during huckleberry season. “They’d stay there until it snowed,” Sherwood said. “I think about that a lot, and that’s what’s pushed me forward.”
Harvey, as well as Ḱamíłpa Chief Bronsco Jim Jr. and Yakama Nation Tribal Council member Jeremy Takala, will discuss the commercial huckleberry program and the Forest Service’s latest change at an event hosted by High Country News and the Native Arts + Cultures Foundation on April 9 in Portland, Oregon.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-forest-service-huckleberry.jpg,,,2025-04-03 12:18:24.739763

Gretchen Whitmer.
Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were found guilty in August 2022 of conspiring to kidnap and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction in connection to an effort that sought to kidnap Whitmer from her vacation home in northern Michigan in 2020. Federal prosecutors said the pair were part of a group that orchestrated the scheme in retaliation for her COVID-19 restrictions early on in the pandemic. 
Croft, 41 and a trucker from Delaware, was additionally found guilty of possession of an unregistered destructive device and was sentenced to just over 19-and-a-half years in prison. Fox, 49 and from Grand Rapids, is serving a 16-year prison sentence.
Attorneys for the pair appealed their convictions, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to find them guilty and that judicial rulings during the trial unfairly limited both the defense’s time for cross-examination as well as “the scope of the admissibility of certain government informant statements.”
However, in a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and let the convictions stand.
“Based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury saw and heard a host of video and audio recordings of Defendants promising violence, planning and participating in trainings, bringing their own weapons and material, and plotting the abduction without reluctance,” the opinion said. It also said the defendants had presented “weak” evidence that they had been entrapped by government informants.
It was the second trial for Fox and Croft after an initial jury could not reach a verdict, while acquitting two other defendants, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta. Of the 14 individuals charged in both state and federal court with taking part in the plot, five were acquitted.
Authorities say the group sought to create chaos in the days leading up to the 2020 general election. Investigators said Fox and Croft conspired to obtain a weapon of mass destruction, related to their attempt to purchase explosives that could be used to blow up a bridge near Whitmer’s vacation home in order to slow police response to the kidnapping.
Evidence presented during both trials indicated Fox twice traveled to northern Michigan to scout out the area around Whitmer’s second home with Croft and an undercover agent coming along on one of the trips.
While authorities only charged the defendants with trying to kidnap Whitmer, she has maintained the ultimate goal of the plot was to murder her.
“The intent was not about ransom,” Whitmer said in an October 2020 interview with the Michigan Advance. “It was to put me on some sort of a trial and execute me. And for some reason that seems to have been lost in all of the coverage.”

(Getty Images)When the government puts legal barriers in place to strip away or prevent health care access, it’s not just politics — it’s real people’s lives at stake.
During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House. This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their job will be affected if the laws would drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.” But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk. Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients. Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools around the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn. Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried. When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people. Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/transhealthcare-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 12:18:24.739763

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear had declared a state of emergency ahead of the storms, which weather forecasters had anticipated could spark long-track tornadoes and high winds. Forecasters had designated West Kentucky as having the highest risk for severe weather, and first responders from the region on social media reported injuries and property damage from the storms.

Rural hospital leaders are questioning whether they can continue to afford to do business with Medicare Advantage companies, and some say the only way to maintain services and protect patients is to end their contracts with the private insurers.
Medicare Advantage plans pay hospitals lower rates than traditional Medicare, said Jason Merkley, CEO of Brookings Health System in South Dakota. Merkley worried the losses would spark staff layoffs and cuts to patient services. So last year, Brookings Health dropped all four contracts it had with major Medicare Advantage companies.
“I’ve had lots of discussions with CEOs and executive teams across the country in regard to that,” said Merkley, whose health system operates a hospital and clinics in the small city of Brookings and surrounding rural areas.
Merkley and other rural hospital operators in recent years have enumerated a long list of concerns about the publicly funded, privately run health plans. In addition to the reimbursement issue, their complaints include payment delays and a resistance to authorizing patient care.
But rural hospitals abandoning their Medicare Advantage contracts can leave local patients without nearby in-network providers or force them to scramble to switch coverage.
Medicare is the main federal health insurance program for people 65 or older. Participants can enroll in traditional, government-run Medicare or in a Medicare Advantage plan run by a private insurance company.
In 2024, 56% of urban Medicare recipients were enrolled in a private plan, according to a report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a federal agency that advises Congress. While just 47% of rural recipients enrolled in a private plan, Medicare Advantage has expanded more quickly in rural areas.
In recent years, average Medicare Advantage reimbursements to rural hospitals were about 90% of what traditional Medicare paid, according to a new report from the American Hospital Association. And traditional Medicare already pays hospitals much less than private plans, according to a recent study by Rand Corp., a research nonprofit.
Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer at the National Rural Health Association, said Medicare Advantage is particularly challenging for small rural facilities designated critical access hospitals. Traditional Medicare pays such hospitals extra, but the private insurance companies aren’t required to do so.
“The vast majority of our rural hospitals are not in a position where they can take further cuts to payment,” Cochran-McClain said. “There are so many that are just really in a precarious financial spot.”
Nearly 200 rural hospitals have ended inpatient services or shuttered since 2005.
Mehmet Oz — doctor, former talk show host, and President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — has promoted and worked for the private Medicare industry and called for “Medicare Advantage for all.” But during his recent confirmation hearing, he called for more oversight as he acknowledged bipartisan concerns about the plans’ cost to taxpayers and their effect on patients.
Cochran-McClain said some Republican lawmakers want to address these issues while supporting Medicare Advantage.
“But I don’t think we’ve seen enough yet to really know what direction that’s all going to take,” she said.
Medicare Advantage plans can offer lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs for some participants. Nearly all offer extra benefits, such as vision, hearing, and dental coverage. Many also offer perks, such as gym memberships, nutrition services, and allowances for over-the-counter health supplies.
But a recent study in the Health Services Research journal found that rural patients on private plans struggled to access and afford care more often than rural enrollees on traditional Medicare and urban participants in both kinds of plans.
Susan Reilly, a spokesperson for the Better Medicare Alliance, said a recent report published by her group, which promotes Medicare Advantage, found that private plans are more affordable than traditional Medicare for rural beneficiaries. That analysis was conducted by an outside firm and based on a government survey of Medicare recipients.
Reilly also pointed to a study in The American Journal of Managed Care that found the growth of private plans in rural areas from 2008-2019 was associated with increased financial stability for hospitals and a reduced risk of closure.
Merkley said that’s not what he’s seeing on the ground in rural South Dakota.
He said traditional Medicare reimbursed Brookings Health System 91 cents for every dollar it spent on care in 2023, while Medicare Advantage plans paid 76 cents per dollar spent. He said his staff tried negotiating better contracts with the big Medicare Advantage companies, to no avail.
Patients who remain on private plans that no longer contract with their local hospitals and clinics may face higher prices unless they travel to in-network facilities, which in rural areas can be hours away. Merkley said most patients at Brookings Health switched to traditional Medicare or to regional Medicare Advantage plans that work better with the hospital system.
But switching from private to traditional Medicare can be unaffordable for patients.
That’s because in most states, Medigap plans — supplemental plans that help people on traditional Medicare cover out-of-pocket costs — can deny coverage or base their prices on patients’ medical history if they switch from a private plan.
Some rural health systems say they no longer work with any Medicare Advantage companies. They include Great Plains Health, which serves parts of rural Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, and Kimball Health Services, which is based in two small towns in Nebraska and Wyoming.
Medicare Advantage plans often limit the providers patients can see and require referrals and prior authorization for certain services. Requesting referrals, seeking preauthorization, and appealing denials can delay treatment for patients while adding extra work for doctors and billing staff.
“The unique rural lens on that is that rural providers really tend to be pretty bare-bone shops,” Cochran-McClain said. “That kind of administrative burden pulls people away from really being able to focus on providing quality care to their beneficiaries.”
Jonathon Green, CEO of Taylor Health Care Group in rural Georgia, said his system had to set up a team to deal solely with coverage denials, mostly from Medicare Advantage companies. He said some plans frequently decline to authorize payments before treatments, refuse to cover services they already approved, and deny payment for care that shouldn’t need approval.
In these cases, Green said, the companies argue that the care wasn’t appropriate for the patient.
“We hear that term constantly — ‘It’s not medically necessary,’” he said. “That’s the catchall for everything.”
Green said Taylor Health Care Group has considered dropping its Medicare Advantage contracts but is keeping them for now.
Cochran-McClain said her group supports policy changes, such as a federal bill that aims to streamline prior authorization while requiring Medicare Advantage companies to share data about the process. The 2024 bill was co-sponsored by more than half of U.S. senators, but needs to be reintroduced this year.
Cochran-McClain said rural-health advocates also want the government to require private plans to pay critical access hospitals and similar rural facilities as much as they would receive from traditional Medicare.
Green and Merkley stressed that they aren’t against the concept of private Medicare plans; they just want them to be fairer to rural facilities and patients.
Green said rural and independent hospitals don’t have the leverage that urban hospitals and large chains do in negotiations with giant Medicare Advantage companies.
“We just don’t have the ability to swing the pendulum enough,” he said.

Chris Pappas with supporters in Manchester on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Chris Pappas, a Democrat who has represented New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives since winning election in 2018, announced Thursday that he’s running for U.S. Senate in 2026.
Pappas is the first to enter the race, and his announcement comes after Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March she was vacating the seat, which she’s held for nearly two decades.  His campaign is beginning early in the cycle with Election Day still about 19 months away.
Pappas’ entrance to the race was widely anticipated by spectators, many of whom see him as a favorite to earn the Democratic nomination and possibly win a general election.
Pappas could face a competitive race in both the primary and general elections. New Hampshire’s other Democratic U.S. representative, Maggie Goodlander, who represents the state’s 2nd Congressional District, is also considering a run, her team previously told the Bulletin. On the Republican side, observers are waiting to see whether former Gov. Chris Sununu, who left office with high approval ratings but has been noncommittal about a Senate bid, will enter the race.
In a video announcing the campaign, Pappas touted his work in Congress over the past few years, attacked Republicans for attempting to give tax breaks to billionaires like Elon Musk, and emphasized his work at his family’s business. Notably absent in the video was any mention of President Donald Trump.
“What I hear from people?” he said. “They want someone who shows up, someone who listens, and someone who isn’t afraid to take on the big fights and more importantly today, who knows how to win them.”
A centrist, Pappas was ranked the most bipartisan Democrat in Congress in 2023 by the Lugar Center. Some of his most significant votes have come when he’s crossed the aisle to vote with Republicans. Early this year, he voted in favor of the Laken Riley Act, an immigration and law enforcement bill pushed by Republicans in the wake of the death of a Georgia teenager at the hands of an immigrant. That bill was widely criticized by progressives and immigration advocates who argued it disregards due process and gives too much power to state attorneys general, among other issues; they also point out that crimes by immigrants living in the country illegally are rare and that Riley’s tragic death was an outlier. Another example of Pappas crossing the aisle came in 2020 when he was one of six Democrats opposing the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act — which unsuccessfully attempted to legalize marijuana federally — over concerns about a provision to expunge federal convictions.
Pappas is the first openly gay man to represent New Hampshire in Congress, and if elected he could become the first openly gay man to serve in the U.S. Senate. There is currently only one openly gay member of the Senate: Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat. Pappas’ husband, attorney Vann Bentley, is featured in his campaign announcement video.
Prior to becoming a congressman, Pappas served on the New Hampshire Executive Council from 2013 to 2019. He also served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 2002 to 2006.
The congressman just completed a listening tour of all 10 New Hampshire counties, where he openly mulled over a bid for the seat. His video released Thursday includes scenes from that tour. Pappas plans to hold an event at his family’s restaurant, The Puritan, later on Thursday to kick off his campaign.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pappasmanch-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 11:05:01.860204

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

Pingree calls for acting Social Security director to step down over ‘vindictive actions’


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday April 3, 2025 10:32 am












U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree reiterated her call for Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek to step down after leaked emails reported on by The Washington Post revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with President Donald Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
On March 6, the Social Security Administration notified the Maine Department of Health and Human Services that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
In a response to an emailed warning from a staff member that the change “would result in improper payments and potential for identity theft,” the acting director made clear that he acting in retaliation.
“While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child,” he wrote. 
In a statement Wednesday, Pingree asked, “If a federal agency can be turned into a political hit squad at the whim of an acting appointee, what checks remain on executive power?”
“Commissioner Dudek’s vindictive actions against Maine represent a fundamental betrayal of public trust that disqualifies him from public service. He should not only resign or be removed from office; he should be investigated for his flagrant abuse of power.” 
By March 7, the agency had reversed course after Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins sought answers about the action. A spokesperson for Collins previously told Maine Morning Star that the Republican received a call from Dudek during which he claimed it was done in error.
When asked about the insult, Mills told reporters: “This is the same guy that admitted that he suspended Maine’s enumeration at birth and funeral directors’ program. First, he said it was a mistake, said it was inadvertent, then, God bless, Sen. King and Sen. Collins got after him and then he admitted he did it on purpose because the governor of Maine was not ‘sufficiently cordial to the president and I said, ‘I can’t speak to that.’”

USDA pausing funding to Maine school programs over alleged Title IX violations


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday April 2, 2025 5:35 pm












The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation.
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said.

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday April 1, 2025 4:14 pm












The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 11:05:01.860204

The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
The two-year budget was ‘not the last word.’ Here’s what comes next.

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states, including Maine, received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face. 


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A bill that advanced in the Alaska Senate on Wednesday would provide a $1,000 per-student boost to the state’s school funding formula. It also would limit class sizes and tie funding for homeschooling to students being assessed through a standardized test or portfolio. 
The Senate Education Committee introduced and quickly voted in favor of its own version of House Bill 69, which the lower chamber passed earlier this month. It added several policy changes.
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage and the committee chair, said in an interview before introducing the committee version that she hoped the legislation “showcases that we want to find common ground, that we want to build a better Alaska together.”
Mike Mason, an aide for Tobin, began a presentation on the bill by saying that Alaska schools are in crisis. 
“Funding has not kept up with inflation,” he said. “Simultaneously, there’s a nationwide shortage of teachers and other education professionals as a state. It looks like we are shortchanging the future academic and economic success of our children by not funding our schools to thrive.”
Mason described some of the key additions to the legislation, which originated as a measure to increase the core of the funding formula, known as the base student allocation.  
“It retains the heart of House Bill 69 that is the $1,000 BSA increase,” Mason said. “The BSA supports all forms of public education, that includes charter schools, the home school component …. It will allow schools to have better programs. In many cases, it will even allow schools to have smaller class sizes.”
Class sizes are addressed in the committee version with the new maximum class sizes, to curb overcrowding. The bill allows districts to exclude elective classes and mixed-grade classes from these caps. The target average maximum class size for each grade from prekindergarten through sixth grade would be 23 students, and the targeted cap for grades 7 through 12 would be 30 students. 
If districts cannot stay at or below the maximum class sizes, they would be required to report to the state why they’re unable to meet the limits and how they plan to meet them in the future. “And then districts that are unable to meet their grade level targets would be eligible for some grant funding,” Mason said.
The bill also expands open enrollment across districts statewide, allowing families to enroll students in the public school of their choice, with some exceptions and provisions for neighborhood schools. “For instance, school districts are allowed to make policies that include a preference for siblings and children of employees of the school. Districts can also give preference to military families, and the capacity of a school would be determined by the local school board,” Mason said.
The legislation also included provisions to boost career and technical training opportunities, and a new task force on education funding to help find ways to lower costs, such as insurance and school maintenance.
Another provision would attach homeschool allotment funding to students participating in standardized testing, including “state standards-based assessment, alternative assessment, or provide a student portfolio based on criteria established by DEED.”
Sen. Jesse Bjorkman, R-Nikiski, introduced an amendment Wednesday to allow that provision to start next year, which was adopted unanimously. 
“I want to make sure that people have time to adjust. And certainly no homeschooler should go without an allotment that is expecting it for next school year,” he said.
The amended bill was unanimously moved by the four committee members present on Wednesday, with Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok, excused. It is on track to go to the Senate Finance Committee next week. 
The price tag for HB 69 is estimated at $253 million added to per student funding, plus $22 million for the state’s reading program, according to the legislative budget analysts, to total $275 million. 
If there are additional costs for the committee’s bill, they will be presented to the finance committee, according to Mason. 
Tobin said Wednesday morning that she is confident in legislators being able to fund major priorities, including education. She rejected pitting the Permanent Fund dividend amount against school funding. 
“I think it is a false choice between having x and getting y,” she said. “I think once we put all the great minds in this building together, we can actually build a system that puts resources where they’re desperately needed into our state systems …. We can do it all.”

The Nansemond Indian Nation is accusing the state of Virginia of undermining its sovereign rights and violating federal law by refusing to pay out $1.7 million in Medicaid claims.
The tribe alleges in a new federal lawsuit that state agencies and officials are trying to shift the blame for Virginia’s financial mistakes and coerce Fishing Point Healthcare, a clinic operated by the tribe, into a new structure to compete less with other private providers.
“Rather than partnering with a federally recognized Tribal Nation to improve health-care access for low-income families and stabilize Virginia’s own faltering healthcare infrastructure, Virginia officials have instead weaponized the Commonwealth’s administrative machinery to punish a Tribal Health Program that dared to step into the breach,” reads the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday.
The filing says Virginia appears to have thought Fishing Point would only be serving tribal members. The suit says state agencies likely claimed an incorrect amount for Medicaid payments for non-Native American patients than allowed, “thereby creating a substantial risk that the federal government would reclaim millions of dollars from” the state.
The tribe says the state argued after the fact that some of the services Fishing Point was providing were not authorized for Medicaid reimbursement “so they could shift any repayment obligation” onto the Nansemond.
The state also pushed the tribe to rework its clinic structure, away from the federally-recognized Tribal Health Program and to a model similar to private companies contracted with the state. The tribe argues the state’s pressure was intended to limit Fishing Point’s competition with other private providers.
The filing alleges the state has refused to pay out any Medicaid reimbursements for some services since October, and as of March 31stall of Fishing Point’s Medicaid claims were frozen – a total of 7,650 worth about $1.7 million – “thereby weaponizing the billing process to coerce Plaintiffs into capitulating to Defendants’ demands.”
Efforts to reach Virginia’s Department of Medical Assistance Services, which manages Medicaid in the state and is named as one of the defendants in the filing, received no response Wednesday.
Fishing Point says it’s continuing to provide care to both tribal members and non-Native American patients, but the funding freeze “represents a financial chokehold that threatens to cripple Fishing Point’s ability to sustain operations,” according to the lawsuit.
The Suffolk-based tribe started Fishing Point Healthcare in 2023, five years after it was federally recognized. Federal recognition allows tribal nations to provide health care to its members and serve anyone using federal healthcare assistance like Medicaid.
The system started with a clinic in Portsmouth and Fishing point just opened its second clinic in Newport News. Fishing Point CEO Lance Johnson told WHRO earlier this year the health system has plans for expansion to other cities over the next few years, including a Norfolk clinic already in the works.

Pete Ricketts in the midterms.  
The former Omaha labor leader’s announcement of a second possible Senate run comes after his populist bid against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., in 2024 made national headlines for turning an expected safe race into a potential upset. He attracted an extraordinary fundraising haul for a nonpartisan federal candidate in Nebraska of $14 million, including some late money from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee once they saw his momentum. He lost by about six percentage points.

Osborn told the Nebraska Examiner last month that he had expanded his scope for his next political office run last month after initially thinking about running against Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon in the Omaha-based 2nd District or running for governor against GOP Gov. Jim Pillen. 
The steamfitter who made his name by leading the Kellogg’s strike in Omaha in 2021 and made waves by choosing to pay himself in 2024 with campaign funds chose the race that offered the clearest contrast.
“Multi-billionaire Pete Ricketts is Nebraska’s other Senator. He’s up next year,” Osborn said. “We could replace a billionaire with a mechanic.” 
Ricketts served two terms as governor before Pillen. He was the most established figure in the Nebraska Republican Party until some in the party’s base revolted against the leadership team loyal to Ricketts. As the eldest son of a billionaire businessman who founded TD Ameritrade and whose family now owns the Chicago Cubs, Ricketts has a significant political war chest and has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics.
Populism’s rise
But populism, whether Osborn’s approach or Trump’s, is the driving force in modern politics, as voters lose faith in institutions and seek alternatives. The same working-class-focused rhetoric that drove President Donald Trump’s victory gives someone like Osborn an opening. 
Typical political wisdom would suggest risk to the incumbent party during midterm elections, which could help Osborn, but Democrats bucked that trend and gained a firmer grip in the Senate in 2022. 
After losing to Fischer, Osborn launched a political action committee to support working-class candidates and encourage more “plumbers, carpenters, teachers, nurses and factory workers to run for office.” 
While populism is on Osborn’s side, Ricketts has the dominant political operation in the state. Republicans who crossed him have lost seats, and his endorsement holds weight. His endorsed candidate for governor, Pillen, defeated a Trump-endorsed candidate in 2022, Charles Herbster.
“Even Chuck Schumer’s $4 million wasn’t enough to sell Nebraskans on Dan Osborn being anything other than a liberal Democrat,” a political spokeswoman for Ricketts said. “Voters will reject Dan Osborn again because they know he will oppose the America First agenda and side with the coastal elites bankrolling his campaigns.”
Partisan questions
Nebraska Republicans, including Fischer, have called Osborn a Democrat in sheep’s clothing. Several joked Thursday about him tweeting a fundraising link from ActBlue, a key fundraising tool of used by many Democrats.
Osborn said on the podcast of his former campaign manager, the Dan Parsons Show, that he did not want to play spoiler in a potential three-way race in the 2nd District. Democrats haven’t yet announced a candidate for the congressional district, but have signaled they will. The potentially crowded 2nd District field contributed to Osborn choosing a different path. 
“It is our job to build the Democratic Party, and we are focused on doing that while creating alliances with candidates like Dan when it is the best path for Nebraskans,” Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said last month. 
Republicans have almost completely taken over America’s heartland, a region once known for its prairie progressivism. If Osborn were able to unseat any of Nebraska’s federal delegation, it would be the first time a non-Republican had represented Nebraska in Congress since Democratic U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford upset Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Terry in the 2nd District in 2014. 
The last non-Republican governor was Ben Nelson in the late 1990s.  
“We could have a chance to win,” Osborn said. “We could take on this illness, the billionaire class, directly.”

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — As she mulls a 2026 gubernatorial bid, South Carolina’s lieutenant governor says her decision is guided by a desire to build on the state’s economic growth under Gov. Henry McMaster using her own business experience.
Pam Evette has served alongside McMaster since the 2018 election, the first in the state with candidates for governor and lieutenant governor running on the same ticket. McMaster, the state’s oldest and longest-serving elected governor in state history, can’t run again.
“That plays a factor in this, making sure that legacy continues on, so I’m seriously considering (running),” Evette told the SC Daily Gazette on Wednesday.
She did not give a timeline for a decision.
Evette, who joined McMaster’s team as his running mate in November 2017, said the accomplishments she’s proud of include using the governor’s bully pulpit to promote the career paths available to students through the state’s technical colleges.
Her roles have included leading South Carolina’s 2020 Complete Count Committee, which had the unexpected task of getting an official tally of residents amid a pandemic.
The 57-year-old accountant will be aided by the political action committee Patriots for South Carolina. Made up of allies of President Donald Trump, the PAC has already secured $5 million dollars in donor commitments for Evette, The Post and Courier first reported.
It’s a boost she’ll need to stand out among an expectedly crowded field for the Republican nomination. Despite her travels across the state as the governor’s ambassador and her frequent appearances beside McMaster at news conferences, Evette is an unknown to many voters, as shown by the latest Winthrop Poll.
Although no one is officially in the race, Republicans considering a bid include Attorney General Alan Wilson, U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, and state Sens. Sean Bennett and Josh Kimbrell.
Unlike any of them, Evette’s bid for governor would be her first solo run for elected office.
Mace, who constituents criticized for not attending a town hall in her district last Friday, was at the Statehouse on Wednesday and told reporters “things are looking very positive” for her decision on a gubernatorial announcement. She added that she was meeting with House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter, about the “future of the state.”
The First District congresswoman has made repeated jabs at Evette on social media.
However, the lieutenant governor said the comments don’t bother her much.
“That’s what you see in Washington (D.C.) politics, and that’s why we are where we are in Washington with an unbalanced budget and things not getting done,” Evette said.
One question is who in the potential field might get Trump’s endorsement. In January, Mace told reporters that Trump’s opinion on her potential run would be a crucial factor in her decision.
Evette said she’s not relying on his endorsement, though she called Trump an inspiration. She’s described herself as a “Trump girl” since 2017. It was at a reception in Washington, D.C., for Trump’s inauguration where she first met McMaster.
Last week, Evette traveled to Washington at the invitation of the White House for an event celebrating Women’s History Month. Mace was also among attendees.
‘Time is money’
Originally from Ohio, Evette moved to South Carolina two decades ago and made the Palmetto State her adopted home, she said. It’s where she raised her three children and grew her business.
When McMaster picked Evette, the political novice was the president and CEO of Quality Business Solutions, an outsourcing payroll and human resources firm operating out of Travelers Rest for clients nationwide. (Her husband became president when she joined McMaster’s team.)
Her business credentials and desire to cut bureaucratic red tape remain the key component of her potential sales pitch to voters.
During her conversation with the SC Daily Gazette, Evette said she’d want to put her “own stamp” on the state with a company-like approach to the governor’s office.
Sounding a lot like former Gov. Nikki Haley, who also had an accounting background and crafted her reputation as the “jobs governor,” Evette said she’d focus on making South Carolina the most business-friendly state in the nation — if she were to run, of course.
As a former business owner, now equipped with more than six years in office, Evette says she has a unique understanding of how to help the state’s business community.
“When you believe that the government can run efficiently like a business in the private sector, who’s better to do that than a businessperson that’s had to live with it every day in the private sector,” she said.
She also wants to continue a push for technical college education, which she says would “create the workforce of tomorrow.”
She touted the success of the state’s Workforce Industry Needs Scholarship, better known as SC WINS, that covers expenses for students at South Carolina’s 16 technical colleges.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Evette-and-McMaster-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-04-03 10:01:59.011138

Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch’s Assembly Bill 388 would require private employers with more than 50 workers, as well as all public employers, to provide paid family and medical leave. [&#8230;]","Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch during a hearing on paid family and medical leave. (Legislative stream screengrab)Nevada lawmakers are considering vastly expanding access to  paid family and medical leave, though the proposal faces harsh opposition from business and industry groups.
Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch’s Assembly Bill 388 would require private employers with more than 50 workers, as well as all public employers, to provide paid family and medical leave. The bill was heard by the Assembly Committee on Revenue on Wednesday.
Only 4% of businesses employ more than 50 workers, according to La Rue Hatch, who attributed the figure to research by the Legislative Counsel Bureau, but that 4% of businesses employ nearly 1 million Nevadans — more than 60% of the state’s workforce.
In 2023, the Legislature established paid family and medical leave for state employees. La Rue Hatch described this year’s AB388,  as “a natural next step” to ensure nearly a million Nevadans are able to address their own and their family’s medical needs. Twelve assemblymembers and one state senator have signed on as additional sponsors.
La Rue Hatch, a public school teacher in Northern Nevada, shared with the committee that in November she had jaw surgery that required six weeks of recovery. Public school teachers are not covered by the state’s existing mandated paid family and medical leave law, so she relied on a union-negotiated program where members can donate their paid time off to others who need it.
Most Nevada workers don’t have access to an option like that, she added, and instead are left with options that lead to financial hardship. They return to work prematurely after giving birth, leave the workforce entirely to provide unpaid care to elderly parents, wrack up additional debt during extensive cancer treatments, or forgo needed medical procedures because they know they can’t afford not to work while recovering.
The United States is one of only six countries that does not have a national guaranteed, comprehensive paid leave program.
Thirteen states have comprehensive, mandatory state paid family and medical leave. Most offer the benefit through pooled payroll taxes paid by employers and/or employees, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.
La Rue Hatch told the committee she didn’t believe Nevada was open to that approach.
Under her bill, Nevada employers would be required to offer it as a benefit after 90 days of employment. The leave would be available for specific purposes, such as the birth or adoption of a child, treatment of a serious illness, or caring for a family member who is seriously ill. There are also specific provisions for victims of domestic abuse and families dealing with military deployment.
Workers who earn  up to 110% of the state’s average weekly wage — about $1,200 per week or $57,000 annually — would receive 100% of their paycheck for up to 12 weeks. Workers who earn more than that would receive 60% of their wage or 60% of 150% of the state’s average weekly wage, whichever is less. (That 150% threshold currently translates to workers who make about $1,600 a week or $78,000 annually.)
La Rue Hatch said the sliding scale and cap acknowledges that the lowest wage earners may not be able to survive off only part of their paycheck.
AB388 is supported by numerous unions and worker advocacy groups, including the Communication Workers, SEIU, AFSCME, Washoe Education Association and Make It Work Nevada.
“Employees and workers are people,” said Erika Washington, executive director of Make it Work Nevada. “They are human beings… We believe that being able to support, advocate, love and support our families is indeed a human right and a reproductive justice issue. Everyone has somebody they would drop everything for, and it’s our responsibility to care for our families and each other.”
Ben Challinor with the Alzheimer’s Association testified that paid family and medical leave could benefit the estimated 84,000 Nevadans who provide unpaid care for someone living with Alzheimer’s or dementia.
Business groups, including the Vegas Chamber, Nevada Resort Association, Retail Association of Nevada, and several chambers of commerce, are opposed to the bill, arguing they oppose mandates that force solutions that need to be addressed business by business.
They also claimed it will drive up costs for business.
“If the government of the State of Nevada believes it is important to pay people in this state to not work for 3 months, then the State of Nevada can pay for that,” said Tray Abney, Nevada state director for the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).
He continued: “Bills with incredibly large fiscal notes or impacts to the state budget have a very hard time getting passed out of here. We don’t always seem to have the same concern for the fiscal notes that affect private sector job creators.”
In her closing remarks, La Rue Hatch argued that paid family and medical leave is an economic benefit that pays itself off in increased productivity and less turnover at business.
“Ikea offers 16 weeks” of paid family and medical leave, she said. “CitiBank, 16 weeks. Bank of America, 16 weeks. Google, 18 weeks paid leave after 90 days of employment. Huge corporations making significant profits have figured out how to take care of workers. It is not mutually exclusive.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-2-25-at-8.09-PM-1024x710.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 10:01:59.011138

Eleven days after 18-year-old Jesse Mickelson was gunned down in a South Minneapolis alley, homicide detectives returned to the home where Mickelson had been playing football moments before his murder. The detectives had good news to share, so Mickelson’s family and friends squeezed around the dining room table to hear it.
“Yes,” someone said. “Thank you.”
Dale and his partner, Sgt. Christopher Gaiters, told the family they had arrested a suspect, a man witnesses said they saw firing from the back seat of a white Dodge Intrepid as it rolled down the alley. His name was Edgar Barrientos-Quintana, and the police had the 25-year-old in custody.
As the family members hugged one another and cried, Mickelson’s father stuck his hand out to Gaiters, then wrapped the detective in a hug.
“Thanks a lot, man,” he said quietly. “Thanks a lot.”
The scene in the grieving family’s dining room was captured in October 2008 by cameras for the A&E true crime reality television series “The First 48.” The premise of the show, as explained by a deep-voiced narrator, is that homicide detectives’ “chance of solving a murder is cut in half if they don’t get a lead within the first 48 hours.” In each episode of the program, which debuted in 2004 and is currently in its 27th season, camera crews follow along with police as they work to beat a clock that counts down in the corner of the screen.
The episode, titled “Drive-By,” tracked the detectives from the moment Mickelson’s family dialed 911 to the arrest of Barrientos-Quintana. Under moody, dark music punctuated by dramatic sound effects, Dale and Gaiters determined that Mickelson, a lanky high school senior with icy blue eyes, was “a pretty good kid” and the unintentional victim of a gang-related drive-by shooting. Based on interviews with witnesses, their faces blurred and voices distorted for TV, the detectives pieced together that “Smokey,” a nickname for Barrientos-Quintana recorded in a police database, was the shooter.
The episode aired in April 2009, about a month before Barrientos-Quintana went to trial.
In court, the case against Barrientos-Quintana that Hennepin County prosecutors presented built on the clean, conclusive narrative of the episode. Witnesses from rival gang cliques testified they either were in the car with Barrientos-Quintana when the crime occurred or saw him shooting at them.
The prosecutors also told jurors that Barrientos-Quintana’s alibi, that he’d been with his girlfriend at a grocery store across town before the murder, still allowed him time to get to the crime scene.
After a jury found Barrientos-Quintana guilty, reruns of the episode ended with a title card that read, “Edgar ‘Smokey’ Barrientos was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life without parole.”
Sixteen years later, that tidy narrative unraveled. Last year, the Minnesota attorney general’s Conviction Review Unit released a 180-page report concluding that Barrientos-Quintana’s conviction “lacks integrity” and ought to be vacated. In November, Barrientos-Quintana — who always maintained his innocence and was never linked to the crime by any physical evidence — walked out of prison.
At a press conference led by Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, who made the decision to dismiss the charges, Barrientos-Quintana shifted back and forth on his feet and smiled nervously, the grey in his beard a notable difference from his appearance in “The First 48” episode.
“Happy to be out here,” was all that he offered to the reporters asking how he felt. “It’s the best week. And more to come.” Barrientos-Quintana, through his lawyers, declined an interview request.
The Conviction Review Unit report that ultimately convinced both Moriarty’s office and a judge that Barrientos-Quintana should be freed outlined dozens of issues with the investigation and trial, many of them hallmarks of wrongful convictions. Long, coercive interrogations. Improper use of lineup photos.
Both the report and the judge’s order also highlighted one unique issue: the role of “The First 48.”
“In the episode, events happened out of order, and Sgts. Dale and Gaiters staged scenes for the producers that were not a part of the investigation,” wrote Judge John R. McBride. “What is more, the episode failed to include other, actual portions of the investigation, painting a wholly inaccurate picture of how the MPD investigation unfolded.”
Conviction Review Unit attorneys concluded that police and prosecutors became locked into a narrative they did not deviate from. In essence, the unit alleged, instead of the case shaping the show, the show shaped the case.
“They said, ‘We got the right guy. We got him,’ before they knew or really looked into the existence of Edgar’s alibi,” said Anna McGinn, an attorney for the Great North Innocence Project who represented Barrientos-Quintana. “It’s on TV. I mean, that’s problematic.”
Barrientos-Quintana’s exoneration may be the first in the country related to the “The First 48,” but it is not the first time the program has found itself embroiled in controversy, though not necessarily because of its conduct. In 2010, for instance, “The First 48” was filming when a Detroit police SWAT-style team raided an apartment and an officer shot and killed 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones. In Miami, a man featured on the show as the prime suspect in a 2009 double murder sat in jail for 19 months before the police finally determined he wasn’t responsible. In both cases, subsequent lawsuits accused the police of shoddy investigations and hasty decision-making in the service of creating good TV. Both cases ended in settlements — $8.25 million in Detroit — paid out by the cities, not “The First 48.”
“No one cared that my boy was killed, and the cops just rushed it for a damn show,” the father of one of the double murder victims told the Miami New Times.
Prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys and city officials across the country have bemoaned their police departments’ decision to allow the show into active crime scenes to film officers investigating sensitive homicide cases. It’s even been raised as an issue by an attorney who represents a death row inmate in Tennessee.
“I wish that the city would never contract with ‘The First 48,’” remarked one New Orleans judge in 2015 after the show was accused by defense lawyers of lying about deleting raw footage of a triple murder investigation. “I hope in the future they would think through that.”
“The First 48,” like similar programs such as “Cops” and “Live PD,” is sometimes derided as “copaganda,” pro-law-enforcement entertainment that poses as documentary. But it’s popular enough that A&E frequently programs hours of reruns back to back. Fans discuss favorite episodes on a busy, dedicated Reddit channel.
While other police reality shows have also received negative attention and have been canceled after high-profile incidents, “The First 48” has largely avoided broader public scrutiny. Over the past two decades, the cities of Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans; Detroit; and Miami have ended their relationships with “The First 48” after the show’s presence snarled prosecutions or otherwise created problems.
Those severed partnerships seem to have done little to slow production of the show. Kirkstall Road Enterprises, the subsidiary of ITV that produces the show, simply moved on; the most recently released episodes were filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Gwinnett County, Georgia; and Mobile, Alabama, although Mobile did not renew its contract in 2023 after complaints from defense attorneys.
Neither ITV nor ITV America responded to numerous requests for comment or to a detailed list of questions. A spokesperson for A&E Network declined to comment.
Moriarty was Minnesota’s chief public defender the last time she tangled with “The First 48” on behalf of clients in 2016, and she is still dealing with fallout from the show in her first term as Hennepin County attorney.

“They are allowed to continue to do probably a great deal of damage without being discovered, without really having any consequences,” said Moriarty. “Hopefully, places where this is happening, the city, city council, mayor, whatever, could put a stop to it, and cities where it isn’t happening, they could be prepared when ‘First 48’ comes to their town.”
‘A false narrative’ 
When Assistant Attorney General Carrie Sperling, the director of the Minnesota Conviction Review Unit, began her reinvestigation of the Barrientos-Quintana conviction, one of the first things she did was watch the episode of “The First 48” that featured his case. She was immediately alarmed.
“It’s a false narrative,” she said. “Investigators are just misrepresenting details about the case on TV.”
Barrientos-Quintana began reaching out for help with his conviction almost as soon as he got to prison. In 2011, he became one of a handful of inmates whose cases were accepted for review by the Great North Innocence Project, a nonprofit that investigates possible wrongful convictions in Minnesota and the Dakotas.
But his appeals went nowhere and, according to McGinn, the case was essentially dormant until the Minnesota attorney general’s office launched its Conviction Review Unit in 2021. Because the unit operates within a state law enforcement agency, its investigators had access to material Barrientos-Quintana’s lawyers said they never saw.
Sperling wanted to understand why detectives zeroed in on Barrientos-Quintana and left other potential suspects to the side. In Gaiters and Dale’s theory of the crime, Barrientos-Quintana was a member of the Sureños 13 gang and had recently gotten into a fight with a member of a rival clique called South Side Raza. The leader of that clique, nicknamed Puppet, lived across the alley from Mickelson’s house and may also have been seeing the same girl as Barrientos-Quintana.
Early on in the investigation, a student at Mickelson’s high school told police she’d heard that the shooter was named “either Smokey or Sharky.” Dale and Gaiters identified a 16-year-old boy known as Sharky, but for reasons the Conviction Review Unit report said are “not clear,” detectives decided that Sharky was an accomplice, while Barrientos-Quintana, or Smokey, was the shooter.
In the course of listening to hours of Gaiters and Dale’s original interviews with witnesses, Sperling was struck by how differently “The First 48” portrayed those conversations. According to the Conviction Review Unit report, about a half-dozen witnesses, some of them Mickelson’s friends and family and some from Puppet’s side of the alley, all agreed on one thing: The shooter was bald, “shiny bald” even. That fact is never mentioned in the episode, and footage of Barrientos-Quintana’s arrest and interrogation shows him with a full head of black hair.
“They show the video footage of Edgar being arrested at work, and he’s clearly not bald,” said McGinn. “That is an intentional omission, I believe, and that’s very misleading.”
At the time Mickelson was shot and killed, Barrientos-Quintana had an arrest record and had convictions for driving offenses and misdemeanor property damage, according to court records. He’d been affiliated with the Sureños 13 gang, but he told detectives he’d left that life behind and was working at a computer warehouse.
More importantly, perhaps, he told police he was with his girlfriend in a suburb on the other side of town the day of the shooting. In “The First 48,” Dale makes a phone call to a “family friend” of Barrientos-Quintana’s, a conversation that Dale implies has blown the alibi apart, leaving a four-hour window when Barrientos-Quintana could have committed the murder.
In reality, the 15-year-old girl Barrientos-Quintana was with on the day of the shooting was being questioned at the same time in a separate room. She told detectives repeatedly that Barrientos-Quintana had been with her the whole day at her home. When investigators suggested the pair couldn’t have spent the entire day indoors, the girl offered that at one point they’d left to go to the grocery store but had come straight back.
Toward the end of the episode, a distraught Barrientos-Quintana tells Dale, “Right now, I just want to get myself a lawyer.” In the episode, the interrogation stops, as if Barrientos-Quintana’s constitutional right to an attorney was immediately honored. But according to the Conviction Review Unit report, Gaiters and Dale ignored his requests for a lawyer and, at one point, a third officer told Barrientos-Quintana that the detectives would not listen to him if he kept asking for representation.
“The First 48” cameras were long gone when, months later, Gaiters and Dale obtained security camera footage of Barrientos-Quintana and the girl at the grocery store. The footage shows the pair together, smiling and walking toward the store’s exit, just before 6:20 p.m. The shooting took place roughly 33 minutes later and about 14 miles away, creating a narrow window of time for Barrientos-Quintana to part ways with the girl, change clothes and meet up with his supposed accomplices before witnesses first spotted the Dodge Intrepid behind the Mickelson home.

“The First 48” episode about the case aired about two months after this new piece of evidence came to light. There is no mention of it in the program.
The security footage was far from prosecutors’ only challenge heading into the May 2009 trial. In preparation, according to the Conviction Review Unit report, prosecutors Susan Crumb and Hilary Caligiuri learned that Dale had been “playacting for a reality TV crew” and the defense might be able to use that revelation to undermine the testimony of Dale or Gaiters.
In addition, prosecutors told their supervisors in a memo that the show had edited footage of the investigation out of chronological order, generating an inaccurate depiction of what happened. As a result, only Gaiters testified.
Because the episode aired before trial and a key witness watched it, Crumb and Caligiuri scuttled plans to ask him to identify Barrientos-Quintana in court. All of this was revealed in the memo Caligiuri and Crumb wrote to their supervisors immediately following the trial to express their concerns about the city working with “The First 48,” the contents of which were never shared with Barrientos-Quintana’s defense attorneys.
Caligiuri, who is now a judge, is precluded from speaking to the press by the Minnesota Code of Judicial Conduct, according to a court spokesperson. Crumb, in an email response to questions from ProPublica, took issue with many of the characterizations in the Conviction Review Unit report but agreed that “The First 48” had been a problem.
She said the producers’ scripting for Dale was “innocuous” but could have caused problems for prosecutors in cross-examination. And she said a young witness became so afraid after seeing clips of the episode that he ran away from home and, even after police arrested him, refused to testify for prosecutors.
“Contrary to the CRU’s assertion, Barrientos-Quintana was not wrongfully convicted, as the Minnesota Supreme Court confirmed and as an unbiased review of the file and trial record would confirm,” Crumb, who is retired, said in the email.
“The filming of the ‘First 48’ created problems the defense used to try to sow doubt regarding the Defendant’s guilt,” she added. “If there was any ‘hindrance to the administration of justice’ in this case, it was only to the detriment of the prosecution, not the defense.”
At trial, Gaiters testified that when he re-created the route from the grocery store to the crime scene, it took 28 minutes, enough time for Barrientos-Quintana to commit the shooting with just minutes to spare. But that did not account for how the girl he was with got home, nor did it square with the claim by Sharky, who was by now one of the prosecution’s chief witnesses, that after he met up with Barrientos-Quintana in a park near Mickelson’s home, they “cruised around,” adding several minutes to the timeline. A private investigator hired by the defense testified that his re-creation of the route took him 33 minutes.
The man identified as Sharky could not be reached for comment.
Dale, who retired from the Minneapolis Police Department in 2023, declined to comment. Gaiters rose through the ranks of the department to become assistant chief of community trust. Through a department spokesperson, Gaiters declined to comment.
The Police Department did not respond to a detailed list of questions other than to confirm that it ended its relationship with “The First 48” in 2016. But ahead of Barrientos-Quintana’s release, Chief Brian O’Hara said publicly he supported Dale and Gaiters’ original investigation and was “concerned that a convicted killer will be set free based only upon a reinterpretation of old evidence rather than the existence of any new facts.”
The jury struggled to come to a verdict, at one point close to deadlocking with three members unwilling to convict, according to the Conviction Review Unit report. But after being allowed to review Sharky’s testimony, they found Barrientos-Quintana guilty. He was sentenced to life without parole.
In his order vacating the conviction, McBride wrote that the “colossal failures” and “ineptitude” of Barrientos-Quintana’s original lawyers were — on their own — grounds for a new trial. The Conviction Review Unit report also criticized his lawyers, saying they repeatedly failed to challenge many aspects of the prosecution’s case as well as Gaiters’ testimony.
Messages left for Barrientos-Quintana’s four pretrial and trial attorneys were not returned. According to the Conviction Review Unit report, in the years following the trial, one of the lawyers was disbarred, a second had his law license suspended for unethical behavior and a third, who dropped out of the case just before trial, was convicted of swindling a client. The fourth lawyer, the report said, has a clean disciplinary record but had passed the Minnesota bar just a month before trial.
According to McGinn, being featured on “The First 48” gave Barrientos-Quintana an added — and unwelcome — notoriety in prison. She said that although he is now free, he is distraught that, until recently, “The First 48” episode was still available in reruns on A&E and other channels, and was available for streaming.
“There’s been no statement that says, ‘Hey, we retract this,’ or ‘This is an inaccurate depiction of what actually happened that night that Jesse was killed,’” said McGinn.
A&E said last week that the episode is not currently available.
Journalism or entertainment
Kirkstall Road Enterprises, which was once known as Granada Entertainment USA and Granada America, enters into agreements with police departments sometimes without the knowledge or approval of other departments in city government. That’s one reason prosecutors and other officials have felt blindsided by the problems “The First 48” has caused them.
After 7-year-old Stanley-Jones was shot and killed by police in 2010 as “The First 48” cameras rolled, then-Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said he was shocked to find out that his chief of police had agreed to embed a reality television crew with officers.
“That’s the end of that,” he reportedly told the chief before banning the practice.
Minneapolis police signed agreements to allow the program to film from 2007 to 2009 and then signed a new deal with the program in 2014. But the city ended its relationship with the show two years later, after legal fighting over the show’s raw footage delayed court proceedings and then-Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman slammed the program.
“‘The First 48’ is an entertainment device. It’s not a device seeking truth or justice,” Freeman said at the time. “It gets in the way of us doing our job, the defense doing their job. We wish the police would never have signed up for this.”
Freeman, since retired, did not respond to requests for comment.
Copies of contracts between police departments and Kirkstall Road Enterprises reviewed by ProPublica give producers broad access to investigations so long as they do not interfere with officers’ work. They also have creative control over the final product, though departments are allowed to review an episode before it airs. Police departments can request changes, but producers are not obligated to make them.
The contracts also show that Kirkstall Road Enterprises does not provide departments with any monetary compensation. Before ending its relationship with the show after nine years, the chief of the Miami police requested that the production company donate $10,000 for every Miami episode to the department’s charitable youth athletic league in order to continue filming. The show did not accept those terms.
There are benefits to law enforcement, like positive publicity and recruitment potential. Alabama police officials in Birmingham and Mobile said they believed the show helped them solve more murders.
After New Orleans ended its contract with the show, the head of the police union, the Police Association of New Orleans, told a reporter, “At a time when community relations are so fragile, locally and nationally, it was of enormous benefit to everyone to have an avenue open for the public to see what we do and how we do it.”
Although the New Orleans police ended their relationship with “The First 48” in 2016, they’re now participating in a new A&E program called “Homicide Squad New Orleans,” which began airing episodes this year.
Officers featured on “The First 48” also sometimes enjoy a degree of local celebrity. One Dallas detective became so well known that a suspect recognized him as soon as he walked into an interrogation room. A detective in Memphis, according to court filings, carried photos of herself to sign for fans of the program. Fan accounts on Instagram wish their favorite detectives happy birthday and track their promotions.
The biggest issue with the show for defense attorneys and prosecutors is access to the raw footage, especially in the days before body-worn cameras — footage that may not make the ultimate “The First 48” episode but could capture important conversations and some of the earliest images of the crime scene.
“It’s incredibly important for prosecutors and defense lawyers to have video of anything that pertains to the scene or witnesses,” said Moriarty.
But according to court documents, Kirkstall Road Enterprises instructs all of its field producers — employees “who act as producer, cameraman and sound technician all rolled into one,” according to an affidavit provided by the show’s senior executive producer — never to share raw footage with law enforcement. It is also the show’s practice to decline all subpoenas for footage using First Amendment arguments, citing state shield laws that protect journalists from turning over their reporting material. Prosecutors and defense lawyers have struggled to convince judges that the needs of the state or the defendants override those protections. The show also claims it is routine practice to destroy all raw footage after a completed episode is delivered to A&E.
But reporters and others say it’s important to protect their work from being seized by police and prosecutors, as well as to maintain their credibility and independence. In short, they don’t want to become, or even be seen as, arms of government. But Moriarty said she believes that, by embedding with police during an active investigation, “The First 48” occupies a gray area.
In 2016, when Freeman, the former Hennepin county attorney, was trying to get footage from “The First 48” in ongoing cases, he said that he found the show’s refusal to provide it problematic.
“If ‘The First 48’ tries to pull the mantle of the First Amendment around this and be sanctimonious — you know something, defendants have rights,” he said at the time. “And people want the truth.”
Later that year, the contract between “The First 48” and the city of Minneapolis expired and was not renewed. A spokesperson for the Minneapolis Police Department confirmed the end of the relationship and added that “MPD has transitioned away from formal contractual agreements with media partners and now engages with them on a case-by-case basis.”
A pivotal scene
Looking back on the “The First 48” episode now, the Conviction Review Unit’s Sperling said one part bothers her most: the oddly performative scene with Mickelson’s family jammed around the dining room table with Gaiters and Dale.
Tina Rosebear, Mickelson’s 44-year-old half-sister, was present the night of the detectives’ visit, though she barely registered that a camera crew was filming; she was still in shock over the murder.
Rosebear, a personal care assistant and gas station clerk, took on a lot of responsibility in her family at an early age. She was more than an older sister to Mickelson, becoming his primary caregiver when he was 8 years old.
“I know that’s your son,” she remembers telling their mother when Mickelson died, “but that’s my baby.”
Before “The First 48” became more widely available, Rosebear kept multiple copies of the episode on DVD, labeled in Sharpie with the date of his death. She’s watched the episode dozens of times. Although she acknowledges some might find it strange, she said she gets a sense of comfort seeing the blurred shots of her brother’s body — the footage captured one of the last times she saw him in his “human form,” as she puts it, before he was zipped in a body bag and later reduced to the box of ashes she keeps on her bookshelf.
But Rosebear said it only took until Page 40 of the Conviction Review Unit report for her to realize that she and her family had been misled by the police — and also by “The First 48.”
“I feel like it was all done for the TV show,” she said. “But that was unfair to him, and that was unfair to us.”
Rosebear attended the press conference announcing Barrientos-Quintana’s release. She’d seen him in court at his trial, but that was their first real meeting. She apologized to him on behalf of her family and gave him a hug.
“He gets to be with his family now, and now we can try to continue to heal with the loss of my brother now that everything was just ripped back open,” she told reporters.
The Conviction Review Unit report not only cleared Barrientos-Quintana, but it contained information that could theoretically point to the real gunman. But Rosebear isn’t sure she could handle going through the whole process again — another arrest, another trial.
Once a fan of “The First 48,” Rosebear said she now hopes that the program is shut down.
“Could they have did a better job if the TV show wasn’t involved? Probably,” she said. “Nobody knows now. Because it’s too late.”

Kennedy, [&#8230;]","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gives remarks at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel on Aug. 23, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona. Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images. I am one of the 68 million Americans living with mental illness and one of the over 10 million Americans who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 
On February 13, President Trump issued an executive order establishing the President’s Make America Healthy Again Commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
Among other initiatives, the commission is charged with assessing “the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs.”
Where does this initiative find its genesis, and what would be the consequences if Kennedy’s past and current public statements become reality? 
We are finding out right now.
In July 2024, during a presidential campaign town hall, Kennedy referred to Americans who take psychiatric medications for ADHD, depression and anxiety as “addicts.” He shared his plan to send Americans living with addiction — including presumably people with mental health diagnoses — to “wellness farms” in rural areas. He has described these “farms” as places where people would be cured of disease by eating organic produce and not taking previously prescribed medication.
During his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy suggested antidepressant medications may be as addictive as heroin — a claim contradicted by research. 
To test his credibility on the psychiatric medicines millions of Americans need, let’s examine his views on more well known medical issues, like vaccines. 
In February, Kennedy said “nothing is going to be off limits” with regard to children’s vaccine schedules, according to a leaked video viewed by The Hill.
Now we have seen the first consequences of Kennedy’s actions. On February 26, the FDA — under Kennedy’s direction—  cancelled a meeting of seasonal flu vaccine experts that had been scheduled to start planning the national response to the next flu season.
On March 10, amidst a deadly measles outbreak in Texas, Kennedy suggested that the measles vaccine had harmed children, among many other false and misleading claims not supported by research. Now we are learning that NIH is planning to terminate or limit grants for studies on why certain communities do not get vaccinated, as happened in the Mennonite community in Texas.
Peter Marks, the top vaccine official at the FDA, was forced to resign, saying that Kennedy was mostly interested in “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.” 
Either by cruel malice or incompetence, Kennedy is steering the ship of national public health into a Charybdis that could have more devastating consequences than the Trump administration’s response to the 2020 pandemic.
The medications that I am prescribed for bipolar disorder and diabetes have greatly improved my life, and really made my life possible.
I take 120 mg of lurasidone daily, which is an antipsychotic medication that will be targeted by Kennedy’s commission. Clinical psychosis is where excited brain activity causes false thoughts, like delusions about being invisible or able to fly. I had my first episode in 2013 when I was 20 years old, a common age for a first episode. I had my second episode in 2017 after I asked my doctor for permission that I go off of lurasidone to lose weight. That was a mistake in hindsight, and I live with a lot of trauma because I wasn’t on that medication to prevent another episode of psychosis.
I take lithium and lamotrigine, which are mood stabilizers that work in different ways. I take 1,800 mg of lithium carbonate (the mineral) daily and 100 mg of lamotrigine daily. These medications are also targeted by Kennedy’s commission. They help regulate the ups and down of mania and depression that are common for Americans with bipolar disorder who are not on medication.
I also take two diabetes drugs. In May of 2023, my A1C, which is the measurement for diabetes, was in the diabetic range, so I started a GLP-1 medication to help correct that. I am now in the healthy, normal A1C range and take tirzepatide and metformin for diabetes and weight loss. These medications are also being targeted by Kennedy’s commission.
Like any good son of Abraham, I know that we humans are not perfect. Our brains and bodies were not evolved to be always well adjusted; they were evolved to keep us alive in a dangerous world. If you are paranoid about getting eaten alive, maybe there’s a greater chance that you and your family will survive and prosper.
But we live in the year 2025. We don’t have to live with clinical depression, anxiety, PTSD and all the rest. We can take medications backed by decades of clinical research that make huge improvements in our quality of life, every single day. 
Until recently, we also didn’t have to live with polio, measles or other diseases easily prevented with vaccines developed decades ago.
If Kennedy is able to fully complete his vision for American health care, 341 million Americans would be left without the seasonal flu vaccine and possibly other vaccines about which he has raised doubts.
Already, the Trump administration has stopped funding appropriated by Congress for COVID-19 test kits and other public health campaigns, leading to a mass layoff of workers at the Minnesota Department of Health. 
Kennedy and Trump are also cutting funding for basic medical research, slashing the budget of the National Institutes of Health, which is responsible for many of our medical breakthroughs and drug development, including in psychiatry.
The logical conclusion of Kennedy’s past statements and current actions is that he would like to rescind FDA approvals for psychotropic medications like those taken by me and tens of millions of Americans every day.
So what’s the worst that could happen? Consider a common malady like the flu: According to data from Centers for Disease Control, from 1999 through 2015, the highest mortality rates in other countries around the globe from seasonal flu are about four times that of the U.S. 
In the 2024-2025 flu season, the estimated flu deaths in the U.S. with current availability of vaccines and treatments is 21,000 to 100,000 for the season. So there is a real potential for somewhere on the order of 300,000 more deaths per year if Kennedy succeeds in his anti-scientific campaign. And that’s only the seasonal flu.
Americans have already been going to Canada for more affordable prescription drugs for the past several decades, especially before the Affordable Care Act and former President Biden’s move to curb the cost of medication.
If current trends continue, we may well see millions of Americans crossing the border to get their seasonal flu and COVID shots, their antidepressant medication, and other health care needs that were once legal and normal in America. We may see contraband lithium carbonate labeled as candy shipped in from Mexico. We can make a joke about how incredibly stupid it all is, but it’s no joke that Kennedy has the potential to kill hundreds of thousands and upend or ruin millions of lives that have been made well by prescribed medication backed by decades of clinical research.
The threat is real. It’s posted right on the White House website. It’s happening right now with the seasonal flu vaccine, measles and clinical research. 
It’s important to speak up, call out what’s stupid and harmful, share the stories of millions of Americans, and stop Kennedy’s fever dreams from coming to pass.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rfkjr-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 09:06:18.968861

The House of Delegates gave final approval Wednesday evening to a bill that would create a Maryland Reparations Commission, sending the measure to the governor for his signature.
The 101-36 party-line vote would make Maryland one of the few states in the nation with a statewide body to study the inequality endured by African descendants. California became the first state in 2020 to pass legislation; then Illinois in 2021 and New York in 2023.
If approved, the commission would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. Those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies,” according to the bill.
The commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives and child care costs.
Passage Wednesday followed 90 minutes of sometimes emotional debate and attempts to amend the bill, which could have blocked its passage with just five days left in the General Assembly session.

Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) tried to amend the bill to have the commission study the impact of government policyies on those who endured child sexual abuse and those as minors “in the care and custody of the State.” Arikan, who identified heraself as a victim of abuse, emphasized her point by reading out about three dozen names of child abuse victims.
“I will stand up again on any bill I can continue to read the names of victims that our state’s harmed today,” said Arikan, who told a reporter she had been “molested as a young child.”
“That is what reparations is, paying back the aggrieved and the injured,” she said. “So don’t wait 200 years to help the families of these victims who we have harmed today.”
Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), said that she used to work as a child-neglect lawyer in Washington, D.C., and that she  understands Arikan’s passion for children.
But Peña-Melnyk, the chair of the Health and Government Operations Committee, told her colleagues to reject Arikan’s amendment because it rewrites the measure and “changes the purpose of the bill. They’re very different issues.”
The House appeared to agree, rejecting the amendment 101-34.
Delegates also rejected two amendments from House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany), one that would have limited reparations to Maryland residents and another that would have required the commission to estimate the fiscal impact to the state of any of its recommendations.
“We will have people come from all over [the] 50 states and try to find ways to receive those payments, justifiable or not, however you feel about it,” Buckel said of his proposed residency restriction\. “That is what will happen.”
Peña-Melnyk said the commission will assess and determine eligibility requirements. In addition, she said the commission must submit a preliminary report of recommendations by Jan. 1, 2027, to explain its findings, and a final report by Nov. 1 of that year.

The House rejected the residency amendment 101-38.
As for the fiscal reporting requirement, Peña-Melnyk noted that the bill already requires the commission’s final report include an estimate of costs “associated with awarding any type of reparations recommended.”
“So you see my friend, it’s already in the bill and it’s not needed,” Peña-Melnyk said. That amendment failed 100-37.
‘Reparation tax’
The all-volunteer commission would consist of nearly two dozen people, including two employees from the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities with expertise in the history of slavery; a representative from the Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission; and the state archivist or a designee from that office.
Although the House passed Senate Bill 587, sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), many delegates hugged, smiled and even shed a few tears with Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County). McCaskill sponsored the House version that didn’t advance out the Health and Government Operations Committee.
That’s fine with her.
“It’s about ushering the purpose and the plan. I work very well behind the scenes, and so it’s OK,” she said to two reporters after Wednesday evening’s debate. “I would love to give Sen. Muse the glory for accepting to be my cross-filer [bill]. Because in prior years, we did not have a cross-filer. So finally, we made it through.”
It also helped that, for the first time, the Legislative Black Caucus made the bill one of its top priorities for the 90-day session that ends Monday. A hearing on the Senate version was first held Feb. 27 and then approved by the full chamber March 14.
Critics, like Del. Matthew Morgan (R-St. Mary’s), called the measure divisive and said it would amount to a “reparation tax.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I think it’s disgraceful that we’re going to set up a reparation tax that might tax one race and give to another race,” he said. “It is the year 2025. Are you kidding me? All in the name of equity? Equity is a Marxist term. Splits people up and divides it.”
But Del. Stephanie Smith (D-Baltimore City), noted that Black Marylanders in the 1900s paid taxes but did not receive the benefits from them.
“There were roads they paid for, they could not drive them. There were schools they paid for, they could not enter,” she said. “We are offering just a conversation and a commission to acknowledge that they were here, that they lived, that they contributed, and I think they merit our time because they lived, they died … and guess what? They were taxpayers that never got what they invested in.”
The bill would go into effect July 1 and remain in effect until June 30, 2028.

Dozens of trucks filled with fresh food bound for Nevada’s food banks were pulled back last week then the USDA cancelled 40% of food deliveries ordered by the Nevada Department of Agriculture under the Emergency Food Assistance Program, funded by the federal Commodity Credit Corporation.
Three Square Food Bank ― which serves Clark, Lincoln, Esmeralda, and Nye counties ― was notified March 25 that about one million pounds of USDA food donations slated for the food bank had been canceled. Beth Martino, the CEO of Three Square Food Bank, said part of that delivery was funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation.
That same day, the Food Bank of Northern Nevada ― which serves about 160,000 Nevadans monthly across 12 counties ― was informed that 350,000 pounds of food they were expecting between April and August would be immediately canceled. 
According to the Nevada Department of Agriculture 35 trucks of fresh food scheduled for delivery to Nevada’s food banks were abruptly canceled by the USDA. The Food Bank of Northern Nevada was slated to receive 12 of those trucks. 
“This was additional food that we got through that program that, frankly, we need right now. The need is extraordinarily high at the food bank,” said Jocelyn Lantrip, the director of marketing and communications at the Food Bank of Northern Nevada. “We’re helping 160,000 people every single month, which is about 76% higher than it was before the pandemic.”
In October, the USDA announced $500 million in additional funding to support food banks through the Emergency Food Assistance Program. That funding has now been canceled as part of an ongoing campaign to slash the federal budget, leaving Nevada with less food to fill its emergency food pantries.
A spokesperson for the USDA said that while the Emergency Food Assistance Program “continues to operate uninterrupted with more than $166 million spent in recent months” the additional half-a-billion in funding for the program has been terminated.
Asked to explain the rationale for ending the funding, the USDA, in a statement, said the additional $500 million in Commodity Credit Corporation dollars were announced by the Biden administration “without any plans for long-term solutions.”
The USDA said that despite terminating the additional funding for food banks the agency “has not and will not lose focus on its core mission of strengthening food security, supporting agricultural markets, and ensuring access to nutritious foods.”
The USDA recently cut federal funding for two other food assistance programs in Nevada, including about $8 million in funding for the Home Feeds Nevada program which allowed food banks to buy directly from local producers.
Before the funding was frozen last week, the food bank received about two million pounds of food through Commodity Credit Corporation funding over the last 12 months. If the funding is not reinstated the food bank anticipates it will lose roughly the same amount of food donations next fiscal year.
“The situation has gotten worse for many families so as far as the food bank is concerned, we don’t think it’s a great time to cut funding for food programs, because we’re seeing more need than we’ve ever seen,” Lantrip said.
A cascade of challenges
The Commodity Credit Corporation funding offered more meat and dairy to food banks than other federal commodity programs. The high-protein staples that come directly from USDA funding aren’t easily replaced by donations or other sources, Lantrip said. 
“That’s what makes it so significant, because this type of food is harder to source. It’s more expensive,” Lantrip said. “Meat and protein items are always difficult for food banks to find, just because there’s less of that in the donation stream, and it’s more expensive to source if we’re purchasing.”
A diverse funding stream will allow the Food Bank of Northern Nevada to continue operating at its current capacity, but addressing wider USDA cuts to the food bank will be more difficult to overcome, said Lantrip.
“Replacing that food in the long term is the larger concern for us,” Lantrip said.
Other food pantry operators in Nevada said the cuts put yet another strain on nonprofits that are already trying to address high levels of need, leaving operators scrambling to quickly fill in gaps with their own funds, food purchases and donations.

The Community Food Pantry, which serves the Reno-Sparks area, said they would lose a third of their food deliveries due to the cuts. The food pantry has seen a 21% increase in the total number of clients visiting from the same time last year, an increase the extra dollars largely helped cover.
“The biggest drawback is that it brought in healthy foods. Potatoes, fresh veggies, and proteins ― whether it be milk or eggs or cheese,” said Barbara Monroy, the director of the Community Food Pantry.
“I’ve started to look around at other places where I could get food, because if the food bank doesn’t happen, I’ve got to find it somewhere else,” Monoy continued. “Right now we’re looking at applying for additional grants that aren’t government related, reaching out to donors, and trying to find other programs that might be able to fit the need.”
For the Community Food Pantry, the cut in USDA food donations adds to other financial issues brought on by inflation and higher operating costs for the nonprofit.
“Our car insurance went up 40% this year. It’s crazy that this is happening,” Monoy said.
Three Square Food Bank said the canceled shipments represent a small portion of the donations the food bank is expecting. Last year, Three Square distributed more than 41 million meals, the equivalent of more than 49 million pounds of food and grocery products.
But at a time when the cost of food and other basic needs continues to increase, and the threat that the increases could accelerate as a result of Donald Trump’s tariff policies, the loss of nutritional funding will be felt by low-income Nevadans. 
News of the canceled deliveries also comes as Congress seems poised to further cut other safety-net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which gives low-income Americans money to buy food. The prospect of such additional cuts  only intensifies the need for nutrition assistance programs, Monoy said.
“The need hasn’t gone away since COVID, by any means,” Monoy said. “Just this last weekend we talked to several people in line and their SNAP benefits are $23 a month. I know another woman who gets $17 a month. That just doesn’t seem to be enough to help people when a dozen eggs is $11.”
Prices for all food are predicted to increase 3.2% this year, according to data from the USDA, and grocery store purchases are now 1.9% higher than this time in 2024. The overall annual inflation rate for 2024 was 2.9%.
Nevada’s workforce has also been slower to recover from the financial impact of the pandemic. Nevada currently has the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 5.8%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
“Everybody’s feeling the pinch,” Monoy said. “It’s just the high cost of everything that’s forcing people into the pantry line.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PXL_20250305_172257574.PORTRAIT-large-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-04-03 09:06:18.968861

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A bipartisan coalition of Utah lawmakers are calling on Congress to resume and expand a program that pays people sickened by nuclear weapons testing, which expired nearly one year ago and has hung in limbo ever since. 
On Tuesday, 41 lawmakers, mostly from the Utah House of Representatives, signed a letter to Congressional leadership urging them to revive the now defunct Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which compensates people who lived downwind from nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and early 1960s. 
Known as downwinders, an untold number of people in the West were diagnosed with cancer from Cold War-era nuclear weapons testing and development. In 1990, decades later, Utah GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch successfully sponsored RECA. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But in June, the program expired after Congress failed to renew it, meaning any claim postmarked after June 10 was not considered. And in the year since, downwinders have been lobbying for some kind of action, with support from Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a number of members of Congress and dozens of advocacy groups. 
“We support efforts to expand compensation for those affected by the nuclear testing that occurred throughout the West,” Cox said in a statement to Utah News Dispatch last year. “It’s the right thing to do.”
In their letter — addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. — Utah lawmakers echoed the governor. 
“Our state legislature has a long history of nearly unanimous, bipartisan support for related legislation, as shown in previous resolutions passed by this body. Our state’s tragic history of past uranium mining and downwind exposure from nuclear tests has compelled us to fight for Utahns who have been harmed, as well as to support those in other parts of the country who have similarly suffered,” the letter reads. “We agree with the governor: reauthorizing and expanding RECA is simply the right thing to do.” 
Sen. Hawley blasts rumors of expanding payments for Utah downwinders only

Since it expired in June, several versions of a RECA expansion have been proposed — that includes a bill from Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley that would increase the compensation for downwinders, expand eligibility for certain uranium workers, and widen the current definition of an “affected area” to include all of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico and Guam. It would also cover parts of Hawley’s district near St. Louis, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development.
The original version of RECA only covered a handful of counties in Utah, Arizona and Nevada, despite ample evidence that all of Utah and other states in the West were downwind from nuclear weapons testing. Cold-war era uranium workers in 11 Western states were also included. 
Hawley’s bill passed the Senate in March 2024, but it stalled in the House, with some Republicans concerned it was too broad and expensive. 
In the letter, Utah lawmakers called Hawley’s bill “significant progress.” 
“Unfortunately, Speaker Johnson refused to bring up this bill for a vote,” the letter reads. 
Hawley has worked on a compromise, but there hasn’t yet been a vote. Last week, The Hill reported that Hawley would not vote to raise the debt limit if there wasn’t some kind of RECA reauthorization and expansion attached. 
In the letter, Utah lawmakers say the state’s congressional delegation is on board with some kind of compromise. 
“We are gratified that through negotiations and discussions with our congressional coalition throughout the year and in response to constituent concerns, the Utah delegation is now in support of these efforts and put forward a compromise in late December. Negotiations on the expansion details continue,” the letter reads. “Efforts to pass RECA legislation are ongoing in 2025, and we urge the Senate and House leadership to act without delay. We request that legislation reauthorizing and improving RECA be included in the next viable legislative vehicle.”
The letter was signed by the Utah Senate’s six Democrats, and Republican Sens. David Hinkins of Orangeville, Ron Winterton of Roosevelt, and Derrin Owens of Fountain Green. 
In the House, all 14 Democrats and 18 Republicans signed the letter. Those 18 Republican representatives are:

She was opposing HB 244, sponsored by Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, at a public hearing on April 2. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Legislation that would expand the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law and extend legal protections to those who misgender other people drew a large number of opponents to an Alabama House committee meeting Wednesday.
HB 244, sponsored by Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, would prohibit public school teachers at all grade levels from teaching or discussing gender identity or sexuality. The legislation also prohibits the display of pride flags and insignia in the classroom.
The law currently bans such discussions from kindergarten to fifth grade, but Butler said the expansion aligns with President Donald Trump’s agenda and executive order.
“This simply is in line with President Trump’s executive order, and I would encourage you guys to pass it as is,” he said.
The committee also held a public hearing for HB 246, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, that would give public educators legal immunity and students immunity from discipline for using a person’s legal name and pronouns aligned with their reproductive organs, instead of the name and gender with which they identify.
Opponents, many of whom identified as transgender or nonbinary, significantly outnumbered supporters 10-2. 
Susan Stewart of Huntsville, a critic of the legislation who is cisgender and heterosexual, said the Don’t Say Gay expansion was unconstitutional.
“You’re going to tell that teacher that they have to use words that they know will harm their student? You’re actually going to tell a teacher that if students ask questions about a classmate with two mommies, they have to drag students aside for private conversations, creating an atmosphere of shame and confusion in their own classroom?” Stewart said Wednesday.
Becky Gerritson, executive director of Eagle Forum, a conservative organization, said schools should be “neutral” in their curriculum.
“Schools should be places of learning, not activism, and this provision ensures that classrooms remain neutral and focused on education,” Gerritson said.
Former Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, the co-chair of Alabama Equality, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group and the first openly gay person elected to the Alabama Legislature and testified that seeing a Pride flag or hearing about other gay people did not make her gay.
“It was a feeling of the heart,” Todd said. “We’re here. We’re not going away. We’re going to continue to be loud and proud.”
Butler claimed a small minority of teachers were pushing gender ideology on their students. He would not name schools where that is happening.
“I’ve talked to a student in my county talking about one teacher that cannot teach the curriculum without spending all their time focused on gender ideology,” he said.
The legislation bans discussion of gender ideology in “instructional time.” Rep. Jeanna Ross, R-Guntersville, said that does not apply to private conversations between a student and a teacher, fellow student or nurse.
“A student could still have a conversation with the teacher,” she said.
Stadthagen’s bill would require students to get a permission slip signed by their guardian for teachers to call them by a different name. Opponents said it would create an unnecessary burden for teachers. 
Allison Montgomery, a member of Alabama Trans Rights Action Coalition (ALTRAC), said the bill could require students with non-English names that go by a nickname for ease of pronunciation to get a permission slip. 
“This bill would prevent teachers from calling them by their nickname, because it is not a derivative thereof, even with the permission slip,” Montgomery said. “This would place an undue burden on teachers to keep track of who has the permissions lit and who doesn’t.”
Paige Gant, a former math professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, said the legislation was a solution in search of a problem.
“In my eight years of teaching I have not come across a single situation in which a lawsuit would’ve been appropriate against a university regarding what pronouns someone did or did not use,” she said. 
Gerritson said she did not want to be forced to go against her own moral and religious beliefs to adhere to somebody else’s life.
“No one should be forced to speak or act in a way that violates their conscience, especially within our schools and universities,” Gerritson said. 
Montgomery said the bill would not protect parents’ rights, but instead protect people with bad intentions.
“There’s a narrative about things like these that they’re trying to protect kids. But how does it protect kids to require teachers to know what genitals their students have?” she said. “Only a certain type of person would want this, and we don’t want to empower those types of people.”
The committee did not vote on either bill on Wednesday. Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, the chair of the committee, said they would return soon.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s two U.S. senators split Wednesday on a vote against President Donald Trump’s economic tariffs against Canada.
The U.S. Senate voted 51-48 to approve a resolution that would end the presidentially declared emergency that allowed Trump to impose tariffs on Canada.
The vote was largely symbolic because the resolution has almost no chance of passing the U.S. House, where the Speaker of the House has already taken action to prevent the emergency from ending.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joined Senate Democrats and three other Republicans in voting to end the presidential emergency. The other Republicans were Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Paul co-sponsored the resolution.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, joined all other Republicans in voting to oppose the resolution and support Trump’s decision.
Murkowski’s vote had been expected; in the days preceding the vote, Trump issued a statement asking her and other Republicans to “get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change.”
After her vote, Murkowski explained her reasoning in a statement on social media.
“While not all Canadian trade practices are fair, I’m keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for Alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods,” she wrote.
“In Alaska, this relationship matters. We share more than 1,538 miles of border with Canada – some of our communities share schools and churches. Our best-known road is the Alcan (Alaska-Canada) Highway. We are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade.”
In enacting the tariffs, Trump cited the flow of illegal drugs from Canada to the United States. Statistics published by the Canadian and U.S. governments show 0.2% of the illegal fentanyl sold in the United States comes from Canada. More fentanyl flows from the United States to Canada than vice versa.
“Like any relationship, there are certainly areas for improvement. I support the President’s efforts to block the flow of fentanyl in our country, but we should remember the old saying that the U.S. and Canada are ‘neighbors by geography, and friends by choice.’ In that same spirit, I’m certain we can find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war,” Murkowski wrote.
Sullivan’s office, in a statement released after his vote, said, “Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl crossing the northern border to kill more than 9 million Americans.”
“Senator Sullivan believes that we should not accept any amount of deadly fentanyl coming in from either our Southern or Northern border,” said the emailed statement. “For the last two years in a row, Alaska has experienced the largest increase in drug overdose death rates of any state in the country. Senator Sullivan believes we need to do everything we can to stop the poisoning of Alaskans and Americans, including using tariffs as leverage to get Canada, Mexico and China to put more resources into stopping this deadly drug from coming into our country. The senator doesn’t believe the President’s goal is to have these particular tariffs in place forever, but rather they should drive our nations toward greater cooperation on this critical challenge. The senator will be evaluating the results of this strategy and its impact on Alaskans in the weeks and months ahead.”
In response to Trump’s policies, British Columbia’s government has introduced legislation to permit the province to levy a toll on vehicles traveling from the Lower 48 to Alaska.

Dina Neal wants to put some guardrails around artificial intelligence companies setting up in Nevada and prevent some professions such as police officers and teachers from misusing the technology.  
Senate Bill 199, heard Wednesday by the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee, would establish a process for AI companies to register with the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the Attorney General’s Office. The legislation would require AI companies to develop, implement and maintain policies, procedures and protocols to prevent hate speech, bullying, bias, fraud and the dissemination of misinformation.
Much of the language in the bill was based on principles outlined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development, a global policy network, and included language similar to “a definition that is used in 44 countries, including the United States,” Neal said.  
She also used language found in Colorado legislation that passed in 2024 and established AI regulations. 
Business groups, including the Vegas Chamber and the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, opposed the legislation arguing it would stifle “economic growth” by deterring tech companies from moving to the state. 
“The unfettered movement of AI without guardrails is not the intent and not the direction I seek to move,” Neal said. “We should know how data is being used within an AI system. We should be able to consent to when and how our information is used in an AI system …There should be some accountability.”
SB 199, if passed, would also prohibit law enforcement from using AI to generate police reports or teachers from using software to create lesson plans. 
The Associated Press reported last year that Oklahoma City was using AI chatbots to generate crime reports from recordings picked up by body cameras and police radios. Neal was shocked by the story and realized “we really need to deal with this” to ensure there were “guardrails that are associated with police reporting.”
“I wanted to make sure that it was something we were proactively considering,” Neal said, expressing alarm at the possibility that “a person is actually going to be affected negatively by the police reporting that may not have been done by (police), but by an AI chatbot.”
Law enforcement groups, including Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Washoe County Sheriff’s Office, opposed the section.
Jason Walker, a lobbyist for the Washoe County Sheriff’s office,  said there are “many advantageous uses of AI in the law enforcement profession.”
He didn’t specify what specifically about the prohibition on using AI to generate police reports he was against. 
In addition to preventing teachers from creating AI-generated lesson plans, the bill creates a working group on the use of artificial intelligence systems in the education system to develop further recommendations and guidelines. 
Two Clark High School students who worked on sections of the bill regarding education presented the legislation alongside Neal on Wednesday. 
They cited a recent incident in which five students in a business class turned in nearly identical AI generated assignments – with the same spelling mistakes. 
Celine Chang warned lawmakers that “unregulated AI use is affecting students, teachers and the learning environment” but the state lacks standardized regulations.
Clark student Karen Wu, said AI isn’t just a tool to “supplement learning but to replace it.” 
“We acknowledge that AI is not going away, but the way we integrate it into education will determine whether it becomes a tool for enrichment or a shortcut that erodes learning,” she said.
The bill would also prevent landlords and property management groups from using AI from determining rent prices. 
Republican state Sen. John Steinbeck questioned if that provision would hurt the housing market. 
“It’s my understanding that apartment operations utilize AI software to assist with filling apartments,” he said. “It helps them with the market analysis and may actually help lower some housing costs.”
The provision, Neal said, was to prevent price fixing by real estate software companies such as Real Page, which has faced numerous lawsuits for artificially raising the price of rents. RealPage has denied wrongdoing in these cases. 
Neal specifically highlighted the North Carolina case where the state attorney general “sued six companies for colluding to raise rent instead of competing in the fair market using AI tools.”
“They exploited landlord sensitive information to create a price fixing algorithm, or pricing algorithm that violated antitrust laws,” she said.
The legislation would also require the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to estimate the number and types of Nevada jobs at risk of being lost due to AI. 
“We have seen reports that within five years, there’s going to be a serious shedding of traditional jobs” as a result of AI, Neal said. “At the end of the day, the state is responsible if their citizens are out of work.”
Other than the bill’s presenters — Neal and the students — no one testified in support of the legislation.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama legislative committee held a public hearing Wednesday on a bill that would allow the state’s dominant agricultural organization to offer health benefit plans to its members. 
HB 477, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, was the subject of intense debate lasting nearly an hour. Supporters said farmers needed more health care options, while opponents warned about the proposed legislation’s lack of consumer protections. 
“We have the opportunity here in Alabama to help the farmers and small business owners who are the heart of communities… by allowing the federation to develop an Alfa health plan for its members,” Faulkner said to the committee, claiming the plan could “save a family in your in your district up to $18,000 a year.”

The bill would create the means for a nonprofit agricultural organization — fitting the description of the Alabama Farmers Federation (Alfa) — to provide health plan options not subject to state insurance regulations. 
The bill states the qualifying organization is “not a health insurer and is not engaging in the business of health insurance.”
Proponents said the measure could be a lifeline for farmers and small business owners struggling with conventional health insurance costs.
Monica Carroll, whose husband is a sixth-generation farmer from Dale County, said health care costs forced her to take an off-farm job despite wanting to manage the family poultry operation.
Her newly-married son, she said, wanted to join the farm. But she asked, “How are they going to be able to afford health care?… Who will be the ones to carry on our legacy if they can’t afford a health care plan and still be able to farm?”
While the bill mandates coverage for ambulatory patient services, hospitalization, emergency services, and laboratory services, opponents pointed out the absence of requirements for other ACA essential health benefits. They raised concerns about potential loopholes and the lack of patient protections established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), such as excluding individuals with pre-existing conditions.
“We believe this bill threatens those protections by allowing the sale of health plans that are not required to cover essential health benefits… and can discriminate against individuals with pre-existing conditions, including cancer,” said Jane Adams, government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) in Alabama.
Adams cited alleged negative experiences from Tennessee’s similar plan, which provides health plans that are not traditional health insurance to Tennessee Farm Bureau members, including denials based on conditions like a history of melanoma or a negative breast biopsy. She also warned the bill could “destabilize the insurance market” by siphoning off healthy individuals from traditional health insurance.
Ben Sanders, executive director of government affairs for Tennessee Farm Bureau Insurance, said Tennessee’s Farm Bureau health plan, which has been operating since 1947, accepts 85-90% of applicants, has a 98% retention rate, covers conditions like cancer after enrollment, includes mental health and prescriptions, and does not impose annual or lifetime limits. He also claimed that data showed their plan did not negatively affect Tennessee’s ACA marketplace. While acknowledging Tennessee’s plan had 250 complaints in 2024, he said this was out of 2.6 million claims processed.
Faulkner said the bill is not meant to reform health care insurance but to help a small portion of the population with health care costs and that Alabama’s bill was “more restrictive” than Tennessee’s or any other state.
Deanna Deschaun, a resident of Shelby County who lives with multiple sclerosis and works with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said that she feared plans could deny enrollment based on individuals’ pre-existing conditions or impose annual and lifetime limits on benefits.
She also pointed out that if someone develops a condition like MS and loses coverage under the Alfa plan, it “does not trigger a special enrollment period” for ACA marketplace coverage, which is typical for people who lose health insurance, potentially leaving them uninsured when they most need health care.
“Offering Alabama farmers health plans that may not provide coverage for pre-existing conditions does not protect them from high health care costs. In fact, enrolling in these unregulated plans — and lack of transparency around them — makes it more likely that farmers will experience financial harm,” Deschaun said.
Faulkner said the bill resulted from extensive negotiations and included numerous safeguards, pointing to provisions like requiring a complaint system for customers and rules for out-of-network emergency care payments. The plans would also be subject to a 1.3% premium tax payable to the state’s General Fund. He called it “by far the most comprehensive Farm Bureau plan in the country.”
“This is not a plan for everyone. This doesn’t even save the nation or the state in health care, but it is an option. It is an option for some, and it could mean economic survival for small business owners and farmers,” Faulkner said.
But the plan is not for everyone. After the committee meeting, Faulkner said that for people with pre-existing conditions have other options, like getting health insurance through the marketplace.
“The ACA Health Marketplace is there. It’s there right now. What we’re trying to do is provide an option for farmers [and] small business owners so they can lower their health care costs,” Faulkner said.
But Rep. Frances Holk-Jones, citing 48 years as an insurance professional, questioned the lack of explicit language requiring agents to be licensed by the state. She also said that the bill does not explicitly say which benefits are covered, saying that “planning” to include those in the contracts gives her “great concern.”
“I want the word ‘planning on it’ out of the discussion. I want the words, ‘this is what we’re doing,’” she said.  
Ted Hosp, vice president of governmental relations for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, the largest private insurer in the state, said he expected the bill to pass, but asked for specific amendments. 
Hosp said that “at the very least” there should be a provision that states once a person has such a health plan, the plan can’t be canceled, and premiums can’t be raised if the person gets sick. He also asked the committee to consider mandated coverage of mental health and prescription drugs, and explicit enforcement authority for the Department of Insurance.
“Alfa has told you that they plan to do all of the things that we are asking to be put in this bill at this point. Based on that and based on the commonsense nature of the changes that we are asking for, it’s surprising to me that Alfa has not simply accepted those changes and moved on,” Hosp said.
House Health Committee Chair Rep. Paul Lee, R-Dothan, also seemed concerned about codifying consumer protections. He asked Sanders and Faulkner if they were intended to cover benefits like mental health and why it was not explicitly listed in the bill along with other covered benefits.
Faulkner pushed back, saying that most states don’t have covered benefits listed on the legislation, and that is determined through contracts.
“Of the 10 programs out there that have passed in states, only two listed benefits in their bill … This is the four benefits that were listed in two out of the 10 plans. So, we have done that and listed those here,” Faulkner said.
Lee asked if Faulkner meant that Alfa would cover the additional benefits not listed in the legislation, which Faulkner confirmed Alfa would.
“All I’m asking is for it to be put in writing,” Lee said.

(Photo: Kyle Roerink)Arguing over how to use the land in Nevada has defined the political conversation for a long time, starting with statehood, running through the Cliven Bundy saga, and up to the present moment with the debate over what role public lands should play in addressing the housing crisis. The availability of thriving natural places is a blessing that we need to manage carefully to make sure Nevada stays a great place to live and work as we also work to expand affordable housing for working families.
It’s important to add some context to the current push to liquidate these places for development.
The “Sagebrush Rebellion” kicked off in Nevada nearly half a century ago by special interests that wanted to gain control over public property for their own commercial gain. It continued on through Mr. Bundy’s challenge to public ownership of land he refused to pay to use. And unfortunately, it’s rearing its ugly head again in the conversation, this time under the pretext of mass disposal of public lands to create affordable housing.
Modern day sagebrush rebels have seized on the affordability crisis to create a narrow private gain from public resources. One proposal in Congress from Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a longtime opponent of public ownership of public lands, would create the broad liquidation of public lands under the deceptive guise of creating more housing. That legislation doesn’t mention the word “affordable” once, meaning that it could be sold to anyone from politically-connected billionaires to wealthy real estate developers who want to create high end housing for the super-rich.
There are frankly no details available to confirm that the latest Trump administration is much better. As they have done with so many other initiatives, the administration issued a press release before the policy, so there’s no telling if the ultimate use of this land will be for Tesla server farms or places Nevadans can afford to rent or buy.
Public lands are supposed to benefit the public. Period. That’s why any sales for the purposes of housing should truly create affordable options for working people.
Fortunately, there are already tools in place that accomplish this goal. Regulations currently in place at the Bureau of Land Management require such lands to be sold only when it benefits the “national interest” – exactly what’s at stake in the campaign for affordable housing. A bill recently passed with bipartisan support to make some administrative U.S. Forest Service lands available for lease for the purposes of affordable housing.
These measures are a better path for Nevada and other states with fast-growing communities across the West, and they’ve already been used to create more affordable housing right in our backyard.
Public lands conservation is an important tool for managing growth. They provide essential services like clean water filtration and and air purification—services that benefit everyone, not just those who live near them. Surging ahead without protecting these important resources will not benefit anyone in the long-run.
As the conversation continues around how to tackle the housing crisis, we urge decision-makers to consider policies that are not just focused on short-term solutions but that also preserve our public lands for the long term. With Lake Mead sitting at only one third of capacity we can’t throw the baby out with the bathwater (if you’ll pardon the expression) through a wholesale liquidation of public lands that includes no guarantees to protect the public interest.
If public lands are truly to benefit the public, then we must make sure any that are sold or leased are guaranteed to be used for affordable housing. And we must ensure that some other lands are protected for their water resources and the quality of life they create for our families.
The majority of people in Nevada and around the West want a balanced approach to public lands management, not a return to the tired old fights of the past. Our leaders have a chance to chart a new path. Let’s hope they hear us.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hidden-valley-roerink-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 08:02:32.223938

Judiciary approved the bill about six weeks after the House Public Safety and Homeland Security did so in February. It is unusual for a bill to go through two committees before going to the floor of the House for a vote. The last major legislation to get routed through two House committees was the bill legalizing medical cannabis in Alabama in 2021.
The current bill, largely unchanged from last year, allows local law enforcement, such as sheriff’s offices and police departments, to enter into agreements with federal agencies to arrest and detain people who are not legally authorized to reside in the country.
Once in custody, deputies and police officers must then attempt to determine a person’s immigration status and get the help of an interpreter to determine someone’s nationality.
If a person cannot provide documentation proving they are eligible to live in the country, local law enforcement may then reach out to a Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) to get information about a person’s immigration status.
The bill states that people cannot be detained solely because of their immigration status unless authorized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and that sheriffs’ deputies and police departments will verify that a person has an arrest warrant within 24 hours of the person getting detained.
Law enforcement must also obtain documents to verify a person’s immigration status, bet that a passport or a permanent resident card.
House Judiciary Committee members approved an amendment making a few of the requirements optional. A previous version required the Alabama Attorney General’s Office to publicly name any agency failing to comply with provisions in the legislation and notify the governor’s office.
The updated language gives the AG’s Office an option to inform the Governor’s Office.
Another amendment also allows, but doesn’t require, local law enforcement to report the total number of people arrested and the number of foreign nationals they take into custody as well as the inquiries they make to the LESC.
Immigration advocates who spoke at a public hearing on the legislation in March said the legislation is creating fear among immigrant communities. That, they said, would lead to mistrust toward law enforcement and increased school truancy for children of immigrants who are afraid to attend school for fear of their parents being deported.
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee criticized the legislation.
“What country do we border in Alabama?” asked Rep. Penni McClammy, D-Montgomery during the committee meeting Wednesday.
Yarbrough said that every state is connected, and that people travel.
“Each state doesn’t have a physical wall, so people travel from state to state,” Yarbrough said.

(Photo courtesy of National Institutes of Health)In February, health experts at Rutgers University published an alarming report: A currently available blood test for Alzheimer’s disease was not accurate in Black patients.
The test measures the level of p-Tau217, which is a protein that indicates someone might have Alzheimer’s. By comparing MRI brain images to these results, researchers were able to show that the tests were mostly accurate in white patients, predicting someone having Alzheimer’s 87% of the time. However, that number was only 58% in Black patients, showing that these tests aren’t yet ready for prime time.
“In another five to 10 years, these tests may get to the point where we can reliably use them, but right now, they are similar to some of the home COVID tests that had accuracy issues,” William Hu said in a statement. Hu is director of the Rutgers Center for Healthy Aging Research and heads a cognitive neurology and Alzheimer’s disease clinic at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.
I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that this is important work. If doctors want to switch from testing spinal fluid, which can be expensive and painful, to an easier and cheaper blood test, they need to know those blood tests actually work for everyone by establishing ranges so that they can know if a result indicates Alzheimer’s in people of different racial backgrounds. Otherwise, patients will be underdiagnosed and miss out on treatments and medications that can address cognitive and behavioral symptoms early on in the progression of the disease.
But this is the kind of research in the crosshairs of the current federal administration, which is using a slash-and-burn approach toward what it considers “woke” policies in the federal government. Apparently, creating medical tests that work for people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds is an assault on freedom, or it’s government waste, or it’s woke, or it’s whatever buzzword du jour right-wing pundits are using on that particular day.
Not only is this attack a destabilizing move for New Jerseyans who rely on research and medical centers for jobs and medical care, but it’s depriving the world of critical resources, even if we’ll never know what they could have been.
Studies like this are targets on two fronts. First, while some of the funding for it came from Fujirebio US, a private research and development company, it was also made possible by four different grants from the National Institute on Aging.
The NIA is part of the National Institutes of Health, a $47 billion, world-leading scientific organization that the Trump administration seems hell-bent on destroying. The organization gives out about 60,000 grants per year. Or did. Grants are being terminated seemingly at random, according to The Atlantic, and while a lot of the cancellations seem random (maybe done with AI), most have been focused on those that focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The agency also plans to lay off between 3,400 and 5,000 people, according to STAT News, and is trying to cap “indirect costs,” which pay for things like lab equipment and hazard waste disposal, out of grants
And over at the National Science Foundation, grants are being investigated for using words like “female,” and “race.” As such, work on creating treatments for severe bleeding and concussions has been flagged because their grants use works like “trauma,” according to ProPublica.
The federal government is also using threats of cutting funding to bully universities to bend to their will. It has said it will cut $400 million in funding from Columbia University for alleged “antisemitic harassment,” $250 million of which comes from the NIH, according to Science.
The administration has said it’s also investigating 59 other universities, including Rutgers. This would be devastating for New Jersey, where health care and medical research is a key economic driver. Locally, the NIH invested more than $405 million in 53 New Jersey-based projects in 2024, with about $250 million going to Rutgers.
While I don’t know if Hu’s work is being affected (Rutgers did not respond to my request for comment), the paper has a DEI section. And given that this administration temporarily removed a story about Jackie Robinson’s military service from the Department of Defense website (adding “dei” to its website url), I don’t expect them to look fondly or even closely to funding that would better perfect Alzheimer’s blood tests if they’re going to — gasp — work in people who aren’t white.
Lawsuits are still flying over all of these actions. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin is one of 22 attorneys general suing the federal government over NIH cuts, and while lawsuits about executive orders that have affected the NIH have been successful, chaos still reigns (NIH leaders and employees received terminiation notices this week). Whether or not they’ll hold will play out in the courts, but it’s already wreaking havoc on what has been a nationwide, shining example of how the government can fund biomedical research for the good of us all. When grants are cut at someone’s racist, sexist, and transphobic whims, we all suffer for it.

Brad Barrett introduces a bill in the Senate health committee on March 26, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that would tighten Medicaid eligibility and add work requirements for certain programs was amended and passed out of the Ways and Means Committee in just under an hour on Wednesday, moving on a party-line vote.
Earlier that day, a separate committee advanced two other bills impacting the state’s low-income health coverage program, with one seeking to establish a “diversion” program to the state’s fastest-growing expense.
Senate Bill 2, authored by Sen. Ryan Mishler, would quadruple the administrative workload of the Family and Social Services Administration by requiring quarterly eligibility checks, a concern for some committee members. 
  Rep. Peggy Mayfield, R-Martinsville, asks a question on Feb. 6, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“Those dollars that we’re putting toward administrative costs could be applied to services,” said Rep. Peggy Mayfield, R-Martinsville. 
House sponsor Rep. Brad Barrett, R-Richmond, assured his colleagues that FSSA was “comfortable” with the workload increase, swaying Mayfield.
“I feel comfortable that you feel comfortable that the agency has its authority already … to make adjustments on its own with the legislation,” Mayfield said, speaking to a later, related amendment. 
That wasn’t enough for all committee members, particularly Democrats. Rep. Tonya Pfaff, of Terre Haute, pointed to her rural constituents. Rural Hoosiers make up a significant chunk of Hoosiers on Medicaid who may not have the tools to comply with quarterly reviews.
“A lot of my community is rural and doesn’t have access to broadband,” said Pfaff. 
Sixteen Republicans voted in favor, overcoming the opposing votes from seven committee Democrats. 
 The amended bill

As it arrived in the House, the proposal already allowed for eleven exceptions to the work requirement, including pregnant Hoosiers and those seeking treatment for substance abuse. The language applies to just the Healthy Indiana Plan, which primarily covers working-age Hoosiers with low-to-moderate incomes. 
Disabled and elderly Hoosiers would not be impacted.
But a large amendment added one more exception for full-time students while also clarifying that someone who worked and volunteered for a combined 20 hours a week would also meet the minimum requirements. 
Hoosiers rally to protect Medicaid from state, federal action 

Barrett also focused tweaks to a prohibition on advertising the program, allowing the agency discretion to reimplement advertising in the future, as well as presumptive eligibility. 
Presumptive eligibility, Barrett said, meant “intake at hospitals have the ability to run a quick screen and determine whether or not that patient seeking services has eligibility.” 
“We found that there’s a high risk … a high rate of error in that,” Barrett continued. 
He said lawmakers worked with stakeholders to use retroactive eligibility instead, meaning that patients found to be eligible will then have their services for the last 30 days paid for once they’re accepted. 
The newly amended bill will also now has an expanded definition of caregiver, after the committee accepted a suggestion from Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany. Now caregivers will also include spouses in addition to parents. The amended language also explicitly protects Medicaid coverage for Hoosiers receiving caregiving under other state programs. 
But Republicans rejected three edits put forth by Democrats, not including two that were voluntarily withdrawn. The amendments, all authored by Rep. Greg Porter, would have removed work requirements entirely, eliminated the advertising prohibition and reduced eligibility determinations to twice annually.
Rep. Cherrish Pryor, also an Indianapolis Democrat, urged caution when it came to rescinding health coverage for Medicaid enrollees. 
“It’s better safe than sorry,” Pryor said. “Because we are talking about the health of Hoosiers.” 
Republicans pointed to dual benefits of the bill: reducing state expenses and preserving the program for “deserving” Hoosiers.
“I think it’s going to make a significant difference on the cost side, as well as helping people out, so I’m actually hopeful,” said Rep. Jack Jordan, R-Bremen. 
The previous version of the bill included a cap on 500,000 Hoosiers, below the 700,000-plus receiving coverage now, as well as a three-year limit. Both provisions have been stripped from the bill though it gives FSSA the latitude to limit enrollment on its own. 
 Other health bills

Clere, who proposed the caregiver amendment on Senate Bill 2, had two other bills up in committee earlier on Wednesday: one that sought to add a caregiving tier to a program for children with complex medical needs and another concerning a “Medicaid diversion” program.
Last year, FSSA opted to limit a state attendant care program after an unanticipated surge in demand from parent caregivers to medically complex children. The lack of guardrails on the program meant that some families made triple-figure incomes and reportedly worked 90-plus hours weekly.
Nearly all families have now moved from the attendant care program to Structured Family Caregiving, meaning they no longer receive payments based on an hourly wage. The latter program utilizes three tiers of daily stipends aligned with the level of care needed. 
“House Bill 1689 requires FSSA to work with the (Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services) Advisory Council to refine and develop plans for serving individuals requiring extraordinary care,” said Clere.

Jennifer Dewitt is the mother of Jackson, a 17-year-old with complex medical needs. She notes that other states have also created programs for complex care assistants, under which parents can certify and be paid through a nursing agency for their caregiving. 
 “This isn’t replacing a nurse, it’s going to be limited to family members … in many cases, this provides care when no nurses are available,” said Dewitt, part of the Indiana Families United 4 Care group representing parents. “We have data that shows that when parents are paid caregivers, hospitalization rates go down, saving the state significant amounts of money, and the reimbursement rate would be substantially less expensive than (registered nurse) services.”
Like many other families, Dewitt said she couldn’t secure a nurse to meet all of her Medicaid-approved hours. 
Jackson is on a ventilator and also has seizures, meaning she can easily work in excess of 120 hours a week on his care, she said. 
The bill also adds an ombudsman position to FSSA for individuals receiving disability services and requires FSSA to report annually on Medicaid home- and community-based waiver services.

House Bill 1391, on the other hand, would allow for a study to potentially realign coverage areas for senior care agencies, known as Area Agencies on Aging and allow certain service providers under the CHOICE program to not be Medicaid approved. 
“I think we all agree that someone who’s doing pest control services, for example, probably doesn’t need to be a Medicaid provider,” said Clere.
But the bill also positions the CHOICE program, which stands for Community and Home Options to Institutional Care for the Elderly and Disabled, as a “Medicaid diversion program.” 
“CHOICE predated the (Medicaid) waiver. But ever since there’s been a waiver, I would argue CHOICE has been effectively a Medicaid diversion program,” Clere said. “This bill formalizes that.”
The proposal creates a pilot program for CHOICE recipients served by senior care organizations to explicitly keep Hoosiers from needing Medicaid funding. That can include stopping falls and preventing medication mix-ups, the two biggest reasons Hoosiers enter long-term care. 
Both of Clere’s amended bills moved out of a Senate health committee unanimously, though the latter will also need approval from the Senate Appropriations Committee.

One of those is a documentary called  “Water’s Journey” by acclaimed underwater explorer Wes Skiles. 
In it, a couple of divers plunge into a sinkhole and travel hundreds of feet below the ground to explore the Floridan Aquifer. As they traverse our watery underworld, a pair of colleagues track their progress above ground. 
Everyone who’s seen this movie remembers one scene in particular in which the divers squeeze through a deep passage while, up above, their colleagues wander around in a Sonny’s Barbecue. “They’re heading towards the salad bar!” one of the trackers announces to the baffled diners.
I heard a sort of a sequel to that scene last week while I was visiting Alachua County. Trust me when I tell you it’s a classic Florida story, complete with mass resignations, allegations of undue political influence, and a developer who’s apparently obsessed with “Gone with the Wind.”
The Sonny’s part of “Waters’ Journey” occurred when the divers were swimming through an area known as Mill Creek Sink in Alachua County. Mill Creek Sink is a crucial part of the drinking water supply for that Central Florida county. 
“The Sink funnels water from the 70 square miles that surround it into vast caverns of the Floridan Aquifer, making it a jaw-dropping diving site and a highway for contaminants,” WUFT-FM reported last year.
Yet right now one of Alachua County’s more turbulent small towns is considering letting a developer build a project named Tara Forest West: a 523-home neighborhood, virtually on top of it. It’s sure to bring with it lots of polluting lawn fertilizer, gasoline, pesticides, and herbicides like Roundup, which will then seep into the caverns and wind up contaminating the aquifer.
By the way, building things on top of underground caverns increases the likelihood of sinkholes suddenly opening up and swallowing everything.
Leading the fight to prevent this project from happening is an unusual group of clean water advocates: cave divers just like the ones who starred in “Water’s Journey.”
In fact, one of the daring divers is now running for a city commission seat. You might say when it comes to small-town politics, he decided to take the plunge.
The hidden river
The town of Alachua, pronounced by some residents as Alachu-WAY, shares its name with the county of Alachua, pronounced Alachu-wah, where it’s the second-largest city after better known Gainesville.
The town stretches along U.S. 441, the highway Tom Petty mentions in “American Girl.” It’s also somehow become the home of the largest Hare Krishna community in North America.
  Downtown Alachua via Visit Gainesville
Both the county and city’s names come from a mangled Spanish-Native American reference to a sinkhole in Gainesville’s Paynes Prairie area.
Sinkholes, springs, and swallets give us a glimpse into the natural resource that provides most of our drinking water, the Floridan Aquifer. The water flows through the Swiss-cheese limestone formation known as karst, occasionally bursting forth on the surface.
Only a few people have seen the hidden river flowing below ground. These hardy souls are known as cave divers. 
Although cave diving dates to the brass-helmet days of the late 1800s, it didn’t really become popular until after Jacques Cousteau — the French naval hero who had a popular TV show — co-invented the SCUBA system for breathing underwater. 
After that, says a history of the sport, “Cave diving first got its start around 1953 … when the Florida Speleological Society founded the first cave diving organization.”
The sitting president of the Florida Speleological Society is Jacob Fletcher, a cave diver who lives in Alachua and works as a data analyst at the University of Florida. 
  Jacob Fletcher via subject
One day he stepped out of his front door to go for a jog and spotted a sign across the street. The sign was a public notice about the Tara Forest West development. Because Fletcher had been inside Mill Creek Sink, he immediately grasped what a danger the development and its contaminants would pose for the water beneath his feet.
“It’s been kind of a roller coaster since then,” the first-time city commission candidate told me. 
He admitted that his entry into politics required undergoing a makeover. His friends said he looked too much like Shaggy from “Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?” He doesn’t anymore.
Because he’s a data guy, after he saw the sign Fletcher dug into the data on the project. He soon figured out something else was being hidden. Tara Forest West was only one of the projects named for Scarlett O’Hara’s mansion that’s being planned for Alachua by the same developer.
“There’s five of them,” he said. “Five separate plats. It should have been done as one master plan, all at once.”
By splitting them up, he told me, “It hides the scope. Instead of seeing that it’s thousands of houses, you think it’s just 300 or 500. It hides how big of an issue it is.”
Hiding things about this project is what led to the controversy.
The developer swooped in
A couple who are avid cave divers, Bryan Buescher and Vicki Bashore, first told me about all this Tara-rorism running rampant in the town of Alachua. 
Their first trip to dive in the region nicknamed “Cave Country” happened in 2003. They finally moved to North Florida in 2018 so they could go diving more frequently. Yes, they have seen the inside of Mill Creek Sink — hence their concern.
Originally, they said, a developer tried to build a Walmart above Mill Creek Sink. Alachua the city approved a change in the zoning to make it happen, but Alachua the county sued to stop it. 
As a result, the Walmart was never built. People who were worried about the fate of the sink knew that someone needed to make sure that site was never developed.
“The Alachua Conservation Trust was about to buy it,” Buescher told me. “Then this developer swooped in.”
The swooper is Sayed Moukhtara of Gainesville. He’s the man behind not only Tara Forest West but also Tara Forest East, Tara April, Tara Baywood, and Tara Phoenicia. 
I think it’s fair to say he’s obsessed with the single literary work by author Margaret Mitchell. It’s also fair to say he’s not a popular guy. His Tara Forest West was the subject of a citizen petition drive to halt the project. They collected more than 2,000 signatures, which city officials ignored.
Driving the petition signatures is the fact that in 2005, hydrologists dropped some dye into Mill Creek Sink to see how far its waters would flow. The dye showed up 12 days later in Hornsby Spring, six miles away. It was still showing up there after 154 days.
“It’s all hydrologically connected,” a University of South Florida geology professor named Patricia Spellman told me. “The cave system acts like a river and sucks things into it.”
But in a July commission meeting, Moukhtara assured the commissioners that his multi-Taras wouldn’t ruin the caves or the water they contain. He told everyone the four stormwater basins he will build on the site will collect and filter runoff before it enters the aquifer. 
“We are really not trying to do anything that is harmful,” the developer insisted.
But he’s not interested in slowing things down to make sure of that, either. And that’s what led to the mass resignation.
‘I quit’ times three
  Adam Boukari via his website

Complicating the quintuple Tara situation is the involvement of Alachua’s former city manager, Adam Boukari. He’s playing a dual role here, and no I don’t mean like millionaire Bruce Wayne was also Batman.
When Boukari left the city’s employ three years ago, he became a paid consultant, often for developers like Moukhtara. But he was also hired by the town commission to provide guidance to his successor as the city manager, the less experienced Mike DaRoza. 
That’s what led to three of the four members of the city planning department abruptly turning in their resignations in February. One of them wanted to explain what happened, so he sent an open letter to the city commission.
  Justin Tabor via Linkedin
“It appears former City Manager Adam Boukari never relinquished control of the city manager’s position and has essentially been co-managing the city with Mr. DaRoza while representing developers’ interests in a private capacity,” planner Justin Tabor wrote to the commission last month.
Tabor went into detail about how DaRoza pushed the planners to deliver the results most favorable to the developers and quicker than common sense would dictate. He told them not to talk to the city attorney at all, Tabor said. And he pushed them to cater to developers despite them raising lots of questions about the various Taras. 
One of the Taras’ plans calls for bringing in 9,000 dump trucks full of fill dirt to elevate the buildings. That led to concerns about how so much dirt would affect the geology underneath. Maybe it would crumble and be Gone with the Weight.
Everything regarding the Taras, the planner wrote, “was orchestrated by former city manager Adam Boukari to fulfill the needs or desires of Mr. Boukari’s private clients.”
Keep your foot on the gas
A 2003 Gainesville Sun story describes Alachu-way politics as being “rough and tumble,” with city meetings so rowdy that they sometimes resembled “a crowd at a World Wrestling Entertainment event.” One of the town commission’s most vocal attendees said he was thrown out of city meetings 24 times.
Twenty years later, the uproar has hardly died down. I watched a video of a March Alachua town commission meeting that was pretty wild.  
The commissioners voted against hiring an outside firm to help the remaining planner get his work done. The city attorney had a meltdown about being left out the loop by the city manager. A commissioner called her “despicable” for talking about it in an open meeting. The city manager defended himself against Tabor’s accusations, calling them “completely false and unfounded.”
During a public comment section of the meeting, a visibly angry former commissioner named Tamara Robbins told the sitting commissioners, “You are hellbent on keeping your foot on the gas for the destruction of this city.” 
You know who’s not hellbent on destroying everything? Alachua County, which may be the cave divers’ best hope for saving Mill Creek Sink. The county commission has voted to intervene in the discussions as a legal party. They also unanimously approved a 12-part plan to discourage further development around Mill Creek Sink.
I hope they’re able to protect the sink. But I get the sinking feeling that the city commissioners in Alachua may not like the county folks interfering with their final decision on Tara Forest West. Electing just one cave diver to the board may not be enough.
That’s why I think all the cave divers concerned about Mill Creek Sink should show up in force at the next city commission meeting. They should bring with them a bunch of clear canteens. Each canteen would contain water that’s full of Roundup and Tru-Green products. 
As each cave diver steps up to the lectern, they should offer the canteen of contaminated water to the commissioners and say, “This is what you’re voting for.” 
I would hope the commissioners would pay attention to these folks. After all, they’re the ones who have made a deep dive into this issue.

She was released in July 2024 (Emily Curiel/Kansas City Star).The first thing Sandra “Sandy” Hemme did after walking out of prison in July 2024 — after spending 43 years behind bars — was visit her father. He was in the hospital battling kidney failure. 
Ten days later, he was gone.
Hemme, now 65, had been held for a crime she said she didn’t commit — the 1980 murder of a woman in St. Joseph, about an hour north of Kansas City. In June 2024, a judge agreed. By then, she had lost decades with her parents, siblings and a young child.

This article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization covering the U.S. criminal justice system, and The Kansas City Star. Sign up for The Marshall Project’s newsletters, and follow them on Instagram, TikTok, Reddit and Facebook.

Compounding the loss were the formidable obstacles Hemme faced while seeking to clear her name in Missouri, a state where legal and political systems often resist admitting error even in the face of overwhelming evidence. 
Missouri is unique in that it only allows direct innocence claims for those serving a death sentence. Even after the judge’s order freeing Hemme, officials from the Missouri Attorney General’s office — known for aggressively opposing exonerations — fought to keep her imprisoned.
Advocates say the state’s top leadership has been hesitant to meaningfully reform the systems that kept her behind bars.
Still, Hemme took solace in being present for her father’s final days.
“It was a relief,” Hemme told The Marshall Project-St. Louis in her only interview so far since being released. “A burden was lifted.”
She wishes she’d had more days with him. 
—
Patricia Jeschke, a library secretary, was discovered bound and asphyxiated on her bedroom floor in St. Joseph on Nov. 13, 1980. 
On Nov. 28, then-St. Joseph Police Department detective Steven Fueston visited Hemme at a state hospital where she was on antipsychotic medication, court documents show. Her name surfaced while he was investigating an unrelated disturbance. Hemme told Fueston she thought she caught a ride from Jeschke after leaving the hospital on Nov. 12 from a previous stay. Eventually, Fueston testified, he stopped questioning Hemme that day because “she didn’t seem totally coherent.”
He returned a half a dozen more times. Each time, her story changed. Fueston said he stopped pursuing Hemme as a lead because he felt he would not get the truth from her.
During an eighth interrogation with a different officer, Hemme confessed. 
Meanwhile, evidence surfaced implicating another person who attempted to use a credit card belonging to Jeschke and was found with a pair of earrings that belonged to her. But that investigation came to a halt. Many close to the case believed it was because it was Michael Holman — a St. Joseph Police Department officer.
The police chief at the time even removed an investigator from the case after he concluded Holman, not Hemme, committed the killing.
A judge sentenced Hemme to life without parole after she pleaded guilty to killing Jeschke in April 1981. A new trial was ordered after Hemme withdrew her initial guilty plea, but she was convicted in a 1985 trial. This time, she was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for at least 50 years.

Hemme began contacting the Innocence Project around 2006. Officials said the organization took her case in 2018. 
In 2023, her lawyers filed a 147-page petition in Livingston County Circuit Court detailing how they built their case. They were able to retrieve documents from the Jeschke murder case and on Holman from the St. Joseph Police Department that had not been previously disclosed. No physical evidence ever connected Hemme to the crime. Psychiatrist Judith Edersheim concluded in an evaluation that Hemme was at high risk for falsely confessing due to her serious mental illness and the antipsychotic medication she had been put on, which likely disrupted her cognitive thinking.  
Sean O’Brien, a Kansas City-based attorney who represented Hemme alongside Innocence Project attorneys, called her case “a failure of everything,” including the St. Joseph police steering the investigation away from one of their own.
Because of the state’s stance that only those on death row can bring innocence claims before a court, Hemme’s attorneys alleged constitutional violations — including that police hid evidence of Holman as a better suspect and that her previous attorneys were ineffective. 
It worked.
 A court exhibit photo showed the home where Patricia Jeschke, the victim, lived and was found (Livingston County Circuit Court).
“It’s not a claim that they can raise if they received any other sentence, life without parole or anything else,” Bay Scoggin, a state policy advocate with the Innocence Project, said of the state’s mandate that those seeking to be freed must be on death row to receive another trial.
The loophole dates back to 2003 when O’Brien was representing Joe Amrine, who was on death row. He was exonerated after the Missouri Supreme Court found clear and convincing evidence of his innocence. Subsequent cases were mostly denied if they lacked a death sentence, until a 2021 law allowed prosecutors to file motions when they believed someone was wrongfully convicted.
Changing the death penalty requirement could happen through action by the state Legislature or the Missouri Supreme Court, said former Chief Justice Michael Wolff, who spent 13 years on the court before retiring in 2011. The question was not brought before the court during his time, Wolff said.
Bipartisan bills proposed this year in Missouri’s General Assembly would allow someone in prison to bring an innocence claim before a judge, who would have the authority to vacate a conviction if convincing evidence supports a person’s innocence.
During a joint hearing on the measures, officials from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s office voiced opposition. 
“This bill undermines the rule of law and is a miscarriage of justice,” Assistant Attorney General Jay Atkins said during heated testimony in February before the Judiciary Committee. “And what’s worse is, it’s doing it on the backs of victims.”
State Rep. David Tyson Smith, a Columbia Democrat, asked if reviewing some cases that turned out to be frivolous was worth it if the bill freed an innocent person. 
“You represent the attorney general, and you’re talking about people who could potentially be innocent, and you’re coming in here in almost a hostile manner talking about miscarriage of justice,” Smith said. “Frankly, I find that’s disgusting, especially if there’s people who are actually innocent.” 
Hemme faced similar resistance by the Attorney General’s Office throughout her case. But in June 2024, Circuit Judge Ryan Horsman declared in a 118-page order that she was “the victim of a manifest injustice.” He added that the evidence directly tied Holman, who died in 2015, to the murder.
Horsman ordered her release on July 9. She walked free 10 days later, delayed by interference from the Attorney General’s Office, including officials unsuccessfully filing paperwork to deny the decision and calling the warden to block her release.

The attorney general’s resistance to Hemme’s innocence case did not come as a surprise to many on the opposing side. The office has a track record of disputing wrongful conviction claims, even when evidence casts serious doubt on a verdict. That stance has endured under previous leaders from both political parties. 
A spokesman for the office said Bailey and assistant attorneys general who worked on Hemme’s case were not available for an interview.
Megan Crane, co-director of the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit civil rights firm, said it seems like the Missouri Attorney General’s Office “prioritizes finality over fairness.” 
Nicole Gorovsky, a St. Louis attorney who worked in the office’s appellate division from 2001 to 2003 under Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, said she took the special rules for prosecutors seriously. 
“The underlying principles are prosecutors are to seek justice, not a win,” she said. 
But she agrees that more recent attorneys general in Missouri have fought innocence claims across the board. 
Quinn O’Brien, an investigator who worked on Hemme’s case with the Innocence Project, said she believes the perspective in the Attorney General’s Office “really is that it is OK to keep an innocent person in prison or execute an innocent person because they’re protecting the rule of law.”
Questions about the guilt of a man on death row came to a head during court proceedings in St. Louis County in 2024. Marcellus “Khaliifah” Williams argued that his DNA was not on the knife used in a 1998 murder. When local prosecutors intervened on his behalf and pushed to have him re-sentenced to life without parole, officials from the attorney general’s office stepped in to block the deal. Williams was executed on Sept. 24. 
Bailey was elected to a second term in November. Since then, he has continued fighting wrongful convictions, including an open appeal in Christopher Dunn’s case asking the Missouri Supreme Court whether the attorney general’s office can fight the decision that vacated Dunn’s 1991 conviction. His release in 2024, like Hemme’s, was temporarily delayed after Bailey’s office intervened to block it.

Hemme recalled walking out of Chillicothe Correctional Center in northwest Missouri.
“I tell you what, I was so lightheaded. I felt so light that it was hard to explain,” she told The Marshall Project – St. Louis. “I felt like I was flying through air. It was so great.”
She said she spent her first months home catching up with relatives and taking life slow and easy. She also continued fighting her case.
In October, she made the trip to Kansas City for a Court of Appeals case brought by the attorney general’s office. Attorneys alleged the judge who set Hemme free had exceeded his authority. She calmly watched from the gallery as the judges listened to the evidence. 
The panel struck down the appeal, clearing the path for Hemme’s official exoneration, which came in December. 
Despite all that she has lost, Hemme quips that she is “blessed by the best and not tripping on the rest.” For now, she has been living with her sister and brother-in-law in Higginsville, a town of about 5,000 people about 45 minutes east of Kansas City. 
Eventually, she wants a place of her own.
 Hemme has been living with her sister and brother-in-law in Higginsville, a town of about 5,000 people in north-central Missouri (Emily Curiel/Kansas City Star).
She is ineligible for Social Security, having spent the majority of her working years in prison. A law signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe on March 26 makes her eligible for $176 for every day of wrongful incarceration. It repeals a provision that only those who prove their innocence through DNA testing qualify for payment. Under the new law, Hemme would have to give up her right to sue the state for damages and, because payments are capped at $65,000 a year, she would have to live into her 100s to recoup what she would be owed.
Hemme has been able to enjoy normal, everyday facets of life: celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas, cheering on her Kansas City Chiefs and attending church on Sundays. Her faith, she said, is something that has always been important to her. She has also savored time with her mom, who lives a couple of towns over, and playing with her family’s dog, Lucky.
The colder winter months were more difficult because she was often stuck inside. She likes being outside and being able to take little walks. 
“It feels good to get out there and stretch,” she said, adding that even going outdoors while in custody was stressful because so many people were always around.
She’s becoming acquainted with new technology — like her smartphone, tablet and email — and making new friends during activities like bingo at the local senior center. On a recent Tuesday, participants marked off their cards as they chatted about families around town and local restaurants, some of which were unfamiliar to Hemme. She was pleased when she got to go up to a table of prizes after winning a round, picking out a small blue and white checkered quilt.
In late February, she turned 65. 
For many, it’s a milestone that signifies the end of a career. Hemme, though, is in the throes of quiet beginnings. She spent the day with a friend she made from the senior center, and her sister baked an angel food cake that evening. That weekend, her adult granddaughter took her out to eat. Hemme enjoyed a hamburger and onion rings.
One thing that still weighs on her: Other potentially innocent women remaining in prison. 
Hemme is one of 56 people who have been exonerated in Missouri since 1991, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. They lost upwards of 780 years of freedom collectively.

Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, filibusters a report from the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee Wednesday afternoon to block the appointment of a former Senate colleague (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A Republican state senator spent hours Wednesday trying to block the appointment of his former colleague to a county office over a grudge that goes back more than seven years. 
Shortly after 1 a.m., the filibuster sputtered and the appointment was confirmed by the Missouri Senate.
State Sen. Mike Moon, an Ash Grove Republican, sought to prevent former Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz from being confirmed to a spot on the Franklin County Commission.
  Former Senate President Pro-Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan (photo courtesy of Missouri Senate Communications).
Schatz was appointed to the job earlier this year by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe.
Moon said he tried to work behind the scenes to express his distaste for the appointment. But he said no one listened, so he chose to force the issue. 
“I’ve tried,” Moon said on the Senate floor. “My words and my thoughts were not well taken.”
He began his filibuster Wednesday afternoon, laying out grievances against Schatz and reading emails from people he said were residents of Franklin County who wanted the Senate to support another candidate.
But in the end, the one-man filibuster only lasted until soon after midnight, when Moon began offering procedural motions that were repeatedly defeated by his GOP colleagues. After numerous failed attempts to set the appointment aside, the Senate confirmed Schatz around 1 a.m., adjourned for 10 minutes and returned to approve its journal and head home for the week.
The Moon-Schatz rivalry dates back to 2018, when Schatz added a provision to a bill that placed a gas tax increase on ballots statewide. Moon joined a conservative activist in an unsuccessful lawsuit, saying the amendment was beyond the bill’s original scope.
The Missouri Constitution states that: “No bill shall contain more than one subject which shall be clearly expressed in its title.”
Moon is a stickler for keeping bills to a single subject, sometimes voting against conservative legislation to send a message to abide by the state’s foundational document.
In 2022, Schatz’s last year in the legislature, he booted Moon from his committee assignments after Moon wore overalls on the Senate floor. Schatz had told Moon to change earlier in the day, but he pushed back.
“If someone comes to me and threatens me with infractions, or ramifications, for me just coming to the chamber, and doing the duty that I was called to do, that’s unacceptable,” Moon said at the time.
Schatz at the time called Moon’s reaction childlike.
It is rare for a senator to lose committee assignments, though it happened last year when Missouri Freedom Caucus members slowed the Senate to halt. A House member lost her spots on committee in 2021 after being indicted on federal medical fraud charges and another was censured after lying about a relationship with an intern.
Moon, who is prone to procedural skirmishes with Senate leadership, led a faction in 2021 that hoped to override then-Gov. Mike Parson’s veto and reimburse owners of wedding venues for legal fees in their fight with the Department of Revenue.
He hoped to buck tradition and call for a vote to override the veto, something that is traditionally done by the budget chair. Kehoe, who was lieutenant governor at the time, didn’t recognize Moon for the motion.
Schatz became the intermediary, eventually ruling in favor of Kehoe. For Moon, it was another sign of the chasm between Republican Senate leadership and the chamber’s conservative caucus.
Moon said he was standing up for Franklin County residents.
“You think I’m here to prove something else,” he said. “I’m not.”
Moon, seasoned in filibustering, held the floor for multiple hours Wednesday with periodic quorum calls approximately every 20 minutes to bring fellow senators back to the chamber.
Some senators’ offices received calls in support of Moon, asking them to turn down the nomination.
Moon read emails from Franklin County residents opposing Schatz. Many asked for Franklin County Clerk Tim Baker to be nominated instead. The Franklin County Republican Central Committee wrote letters in February asking Kehoe to pick Baker.
“How many more emails until you wake up and do the will of the people,” Moon said.
Facebook pages, such as “Patriot Mama Bears” and “Liberty Link Missouri PAC,” posted requests for followers to email Moon.

(Photo by: Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a case that could determine whether a law passed in 2018 that requires approval from legislators on civil settlements violates the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. 
The case — Josh Kaul v. Wisconsin State Legislature — is the latest in an ongoing legal struggle focused on the division of power between the Legislature and the executive branch.
A  law passed after Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Kaul were elected in 2018, but before they took office, gave the Legislature, through the Joint Finance Committee, the ability to sign off on and decide how to spend court settlement money. That had been a power traditionally held by the attorney general. 
It was part of a slate of laws passed and signed by Republicans during the lame duck period just weeks before the new Democratic administration took power in 2019. The Joint Finance Committee has become the vehicle for lawmakers to maintain control over  actions that agencies take outside of the legislative process, and this is not the first lawsuit the state’s top court has heard on the issue.
The case made it to the state Supreme Court after Kaul appealed a 2024 decision by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals District II that overturned a favorable decision made in 2022 by Dane County judge and now Justice-elect Susan Crawford.
Kaul said at a press conference after the arguments that the actions Wisconsin Republicans have taken to strip power from the executive branch are similar to those being taken by Republicans at the federal level. 
“What we are seeing in these cases in Wisconsin in a lot of ways mirrors what’s going on with the federal government right now,” Kaul said. “At the federal level what we’re seeing is the executive branch trying to pull legislative power into its own hands and making decisions about how legislation should be applied or whether it should be applied. Here in Wisconsin what we saw instead was an effort to concentrate power in the Legislature.” 
Kaul said that checks and balances and “multiple different sources of authority within the government” are necessary to protect the “our freedom and our liberty.”
“That’s why we have three co-equal branches of government,” Kaul said. “This case is about supporting that principle and ensuring that the separation of powers remains strong here in Wisconsin.” 
During the arguments, Assistant Attorney General Hannah Jurss argued that the “executive branch has the power to execute the law” and the “Legislature’s constitutional power is to write the law.” 
In a 2019 case, the state Supreme Court ruled that the law was constitutional. However, in a brief, Jurrs argues that the decision was not a broad endorsement of the law, but only “located a few instances where the statutes could be applied constitutionally and went no further.” 
Jurrs argued the law is unconstitutional in part because there is no way for the executive to override a decision by the lawmakers, which has infringed on the executive branch’s work. The 2018 law has led to disputes between Kaul’s office and lawmakers over resolving cases involving state taxpayers. 
“Having this sword, the legislative committee sword,  hanging over our head infects our decision making at every stage and every action… whether to prosecute, how to prosecute. How to talk with our clients, when to pursue negotiation, and the terms,” Jurrs said. “We’ve presented 13 cases that [the committee] as a body never even convened to consider.” 
Jurrs called the legislative seizure of executive powers  an “unprecedented and unparalleled intrusion into execution of the law.” She also argued that it limits the ability for the attorney general to act in multi-state lawsuits. 
Jurrs said that if the law had been in place in the 1990s when the state negotiated a tobacco resolution it would have led to a more complicated situation. 
“Hey, 44 other states, we’re entering this gigantic resolution with the major tobacco companies. We know that everybody else has come to this agreement. It has to be really confidential, but excuse us, we’re gonna have to hold everything and we have to take this to a committee of our Legislature so that they can decide whether they want to rewrite this agreement or allow us to enter it or not,” Jurrs said.
Justice Rebecca Bradley expressed skepticism about Jurrs’ argument that the power should lie with the attorney general without the oversight of lawmakers. 
“The Legislature in the provision that you’re attacking has prescribed the powers and duties of the attorney general, which is to basically give… the Legislature a check-and-balance on what the attorney general is doing and what I find frightening is that one person gets to make all of the policy decisions under your argument about what is going to be done with what is the taxpayers money,” Bradley said. “It’s not the attorney general’s money.” 
Misha Tseytlin, the attorney representing the Legislature, argued that the statute serves as a check on the attorney general’s power and lawmakers have an interest in overseeing the money.
“It’s important to remember we’re talking about not the attorney general’s money, not the agency’s money, but the people’s money,” Tseytlin said. He said an example is the $420 million opioid settlement that was reached and approved by lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee in 2021.  “The settlement was submitted to the Joint Finance committee, and it was approved by The Joint Finance committee. The Legislature in carrying out its constitutional duty to balance the budget of the state had to take into account all sorts of income, including that $420 million.”
Justice Rebecca Dallet questioned Tseytlin on how much power he was arguing lawmakers should have over funds. 
“Any source of income that comes into the Legislature they’ve got control of, so could the Legislature appoint a committee to return tax returns to make sure they are getting the money that they’re supposed to?” Dallet asked. “My point in asking the question… is where does this end? Every single dollar that comes in means the Legislature has total control… There is no role for executive power here.”

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Getty Images)Gov. Tony Evers is asking Wisconsin counties to give up a practice they’ve relied on for years: clawing back money from the absent fathers of children whose mothers were Medicaid recipients when they gave birth.
The practice is called birth cost recovery. When Medicaid covers the birth of a child and the father doesn’t live with the rest of the family, county social service departments and the courts may add a requirement to repay Medicaid to a father’s child support order.
In his 2025-27 state budget proposal, Evers wants to end the practice, and he’s offering counties a deal to give it up: a nearly $4 million boost for child support agencies.
Although permitted under federal law, only two states now authorize the use of birth cost recovery: Kansas and Wisconsin. Proponents of the practice have argued that it’s only fair to try to recoup state funds spent on the birth of a child if the child’s father can afford it.
But research at the Reproductive Equity Action Lab (REAL) questions the benefits of birth cost recovery when compared to the potential harm it can cause. The lab is affiliated with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.
“This is a policy that takes money out of low-income families’ hands in the state of Wisconsin to pay the state back for the social services they receive,” Klaira Lerma, the lab’s associate director, told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This creates financial strain on families, and families view it as government greed.”
This week REAL published a policy brief on birth cost recovery. The brief summarizes research by the lab’s director, Professor Tiffany Green, along with Lerma and other contributors, that contradicts assumptions proponents have made.
There were 14,880 unmarried Wisconsin residents who gave birth in 2023. The brief reported that unmarried parents already tend to have lower incomes than married parents, making a birth cost recovery debt especially challenging.
Wisconsin gives counties the option to use birth cost recovery, but doesn’t require it. If a county takes the option, 15% of the money it recovers goes to the county’s child support program, while 85% goes back to the state Medicaid program.
ABC for Health, a Madison-based nonprofit public interest law firm, has been campaigning against birth cost recovery for more than a decade and succeeded in persuading Wisconsin’s two largest counties to drop the practice. Dane County stopped filing new birth cost recovery claims in 2020 and stopped pursuing old outstanding cases in 2023. Milwaukee County quit the practice in 2024.
As part of their investigation of the practice, REAL researchers interviewed 40 Wisconsin parents who had been subject to birth cost recovery.
Parents who live together aren’t subject to birth cost recovery — only noncustodial fathers. Lerma said parents told them they weren’t even aware they might be on the hook to repay Medicaid until there was a formal court order for child support.
“They described a lack of transparency and feeling bamboozled” when they were told about paying back Medicaid, Lerma said.
“Parents clearly described how Birth Cost Recovery payments reduce fathers’ ability to financially support their child(ren) by taking money out of their budget,” the policy brief states.
“You’re taking away the way somebody can feed their family,” one parent is quoted as saying. “You’re taking away child care, how somebody can provide for their family. You’re taking away [money for] health care.”
Another told researchers that a birth cost recovery payment “going back to the state is money that can be put into the child.”
For fathers in low-wage jobs, having to pay off a birth cost recovery debt “puts them in risk of losing housing, the ability to put food on the table,” a parent told the researchers.
“It also causes many marginalized fathers to throw up their hands and leave the lives of their children. And eventually, they may get caught, held in contempt. And once again, that whole cycle just starts,” the parent said. “They’re not going to get a job. They have this on their record. They’re not going to get housing. They’ll be always underemployed.”
Lerma said that in families covered by Medicaid, children are more likely to be at risk for illness. Birth cost recovery, she said, is effectively “taxing these families who are more likely to be facing significantly worse health outcomes.”
The brief cites research that found the financial strain from having to pay a birth cost recovery debt was associated with lower employment levels and less ability to maintain child support payments.
“In contrast, evidence shows eliminating Birth Cost Recovery appears to increase child support compliance,” the brief states.
“Ending Birth Cost Recovery across the state may reduce harm on Wisconsin families and result in more child support money going to children and their custodial parent,” the brief concludes.
To offset the expected loss counties would experience by giving up birth cost recovery entirely, Evers’ budget proposal sets aside $3.8 million over the two-year budget for county child support programs.
The brief says implementing that proposal could ensure “that county child support agencies remain fiscally solvent to carry out their mission.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation to study the absorption of secessionist Illinois counties heads to the Indiana Senate’s floor after a 7-2 committee vote Wednesday. Companion legislation in the Prairie State is already dead, however.
“I’ll just say this: things are better in Indiana then they are in Illinois,” said Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville. “It’s no surprise” people want to move.
“We want to open the doors if they want to come here,” Baldwin added. He is sponsoring House Bill 1008 — a priority for the House GOP — on its Senate journey.

The proposal would create an Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission tasked with exploring the secession and transfer of counties that have already voted to leave the state of Illinois. Since 2020, 33 Illinois counties have passed “advisory referenda” to leave the state — seven of those votes occurred in the most recent general election.
As he clicked through a series of slides, Baldwin said Illinois residents like Indiana’s lower taxes, balanced budget, “great” road funding system, job opportunities and political representation.
“Many residents feel Chicago’s policies do not align with their values,” he added. “The Indiana General Assembly prides itself on being a body that serves its constituents.”
Indiana stands to gain, according to Baldwin. He listed increased tax revenue, strengthened sports culture, political “alignment,” and reduced Chicago influence.
Democrats — who later voted “no” — were skeptical.
Sen. LaKeisha Jackson, D-Indianapolis, cited an analysis from prominent conservative economist Michael Hicks, who directs the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University.
Illinois secession bill passes first hurdle

He found that the secessionist counties would be equivalent to the nation’s second-poorest state. Adding them to Indiana would drop the state’s per capita income.
Baldwin said they’re doing poorly “in their current fiscal arrangement.”
One pro-secession witness said the counties are “held back by Illinois regulation and tax rates.”
But a border shakeup is unlikely.
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker previously called Indiana’s legislation “a stunt” that is “not going to happen.” He’d need to bless the move, but companion legislation is already dead. Congress would also need to approve.
Committee leader Sen. Ron Alting said a second witness had signed up as Pritzker himself.
“Is he here?” asked Alting, R-Lafayette, to laughter.
House Bill 1008 was edited to add more commission members and require a first meeting by September. It heads to the Senate floor for further consideration.

(Getty Images)This year, the U.S. Congress has a unique opportunity to strike a significant — and swift — blow against cancer.
Last Congress, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, led efforts to advance legislation establishing access to multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests. The Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act would make a meaningful difference in how cancer is screened for and detected. The bill has sweeping support — both inside and outside of Congress — and, after enormous progress last session, it is ready for quick enactment this year.
  U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, talks with attendees of the Idaho GOP election night watch party at the Grove Hotel in Boise, Idaho, on Nov. 8, 2022. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
Sen. Crapo’s bill would remove regulatory red tape and create a pathway for MCED tests to be available to those who need them most.
For the nearly 1 million Medicare beneficiaries who will be diagnosed with cancer this year, access to these life-changing tests could mean catching their illnesses earlier — when it can be more easily treated. Catching cancer earlier not only improves a patient’s chance of successful treatment, it also reduces the costly burden of cancer care, often helping patients and families avert expensive late-stage treatments and, more importantly, preserving hope and health.
Today’s screening methods are the best tool we have against cancer, yet only five cancers — breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, and prostate — currently have broadly accessible methods. Because of this, more than 70% of U.S. cancer deaths are caused by cancers without approved early detection methods. Many patients with these cancers aren’t diagnosed until their cancer is at a more advanced stage, requiring more invasive treatment – and all the physical, emotional, and financial strain that comes with it.
Here in Idaho, residents experience higher rates of some cancer types compared to the national average. If broad access to MCED tests becomes available, more Idahoans could have a better chance at beating the disease before it advances to more dangerous stages.
MCED blood tests can detect the presence and location of dozens of cancer types with a high degree of accuracy. Because the test requires only a simple blood draw, it is easy to administer in rural areas and in smaller clinics that may not have specialized equipment. This accessibility is particularly crucial in states like Idaho, where large portions of the population live far from major health care centers.
Early detection dramatically increases the likelihood of successful treatment, a fact underscored by the support for this legislation from medical associations across the state. Endorsers include the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians, Idaho Center for Nursing, Idaho Medical Association, Idaho Society of Clinical Oncology, American Nurses Association of Idaho, Nurse Leaders of Idaho, and the Nurse Practitioners of Idaho – all of which recognize the potential of MCED tests to improve patient outcomes.
The Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act would allow Medicare to cover MCED tests once they are approved by the FDA. This coverage is critical because most cancer diagnoses occur in people aged 65 and older. Enabling Medicare coverage would provide seniors with access to the latest in life-changing cancer screening technology — in the same way that it can be available in the private sector. This could level the playing field for older Americans, providing them with more options to catch cancer early and pursue treatment in its most manageable stages.
In the last Congress, nearly 400 lawmakers and over 500 advocacy organizations supported Sen. Crapo’s bill. It has also already been deeply vetted by Congressional committees. With such a strong foundation of support — and an urgent need for better cancer detection — this legislation is now ready for swift passage.
Congress has the chance to secure an early and meaningful victory against cancer by passing this legislation now – potentially saving countless lives and sparing families the devastation of late-stage cancer diagnoses.
Thanks to Sen. Crapo’s immense leadership, the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act is teed up for quick enactment this year. Idaho’s cancer advocacy community is hopeful that Congress will now seize the moment without delay.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)It turns out Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, is not so powerful after all. 
Musk’s gambit in Wisconsin — dumping more than $20 million into a nominally nonpartisan Supreme Court race, blanketing the airwaves with negative ads, paying people to sign petitions against “activist judges” and cavorting in Green Bay wearing a cheesehead hat while handing out million-dollar checks to Republican voters — didn’t help, and likely hurt, his chosen candidate in an election Musk described as crucial to “the course of Western civilization” and “the entire destiny of humanity.”
Poor Brad Schimel, whose campaign Musk took over. At his victory party in the Republican stronghold of Waukesha, where he underperformed Trump’s 2024 vote tally, setting up his quick downhill slide, Schimel sat strumming a guitar as the results came in showing that Susan Crawford trounced him by a whopping 10 points. 
After proclaiming that he got into the race because he was disgusted by the Court’s “partisanship,” Schimel ended up promising to be a “support network” for Trump and stood by as Musk became his biggest donor and the public face of his campaign. At some point Tuesday evening he may have begun to regret that approach. Trump himself seems to be rethinking Musk after the debacle in Wisconsin, reportedly telling his inner circle that his billionaire adviser won’t be around much longer.
Other Republicans would be wise to get the message that “Elon Musk is politically toxic, that he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans to the bottom of the ocean,” Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, told the Examiner during Crawford’s victory party. 
Wisconsin voters are not alone in recoiling from Musk as he takes a chainsaw to federal health care programs and Social Security, gleefully slashing the safety net to fund giant tax breaks for a handful of super-rich people like himself. In 10 Wisconsin counties where Trump won in 2024, voters rejected Musk’s entreaties to support Schimel, delivering a majority of votes to Crawford. That included Republican-leaning Brown County, where Musk campaigned in his cheesehead hat.
“I think the whole country is going to know unmistakably that Musk and Trump have crossed line after line after line, and the blowback has begun,” said Wikler. “Wisconsin is a bellwether state. Whoever wins Wisconsin probably wins the country, and Trump and Musk just lost decisively. At this point, every Republican who hasn’t yet spoken out against Elon Musk is going to have to think through whether they want to stay in public life or they want this to be their final term in office.”
But don’t count on Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson to do any of that sort of hard thinking. Johnson told Lawrence Andrea of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Musk was “net beneficial” to Schimel, and that his 10-point loss might have been even bigger without Musk’s help. Likewise Wisconsin Right Now declared that there was no lesson to be learned from Schimel’s loss and chalked it up to the inevitable backlash by angry liberals to Trump and Musk’s bravery. 
That kind of analysis bodes well for Democrats.
After Tuesday, the liberal majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court is secure for another three years, just as it is poised to decide key cases on abortion, labor rights and Wisconsin’s gerrymandered congressional maps. Celebrating on stage with Crawford at the Park Hotel in Madison Tuesday night were the other women who make up that majority, including Justices Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz, who each won the last two Supreme Court elections by 10 points or more against a right-wing opponent, just as Crawford did. 
In all three races a key issue was Wisconsin women’s right to control their own bodies, with voters decisively rejecting candidates who embraced a dangerous near-total abortion ban. In all three races money also played an outsized role — a growing threat to voters’ ability to make their voices heard over the din of deceptive big-money ads. If we are going to reclaim the Court from the corrupting influence of self-interested donors like Musk — who is currently pursuing a lawsuit to try to overturn a Wisconsin law that prevents him from selling Teslas directly to consumers — we need to put an end to the campaign finance arms race.
But for now the most important lesson of the 2025 Supreme Court race is that voters can stand up to the mind-boggling spree of destruction by MAGA nihilists. 
Musk’s failure to buy a seat on the Court should encourage people across the country to believe in themselves and their ability to resist the authoritarian bullies who are targeting civil society, flouting the law, trampling our rights and trying to rule by intimidation and the sheer force of their money.
It didn’t work in Wisconsin. That’s a good sign.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Senate began debate Wednesday on the annual state budget bill, a spending plan that tries to close a $1.2 billion funding gap and absorb the rising cost of Medicaid in the state.
The bill, known as the “long bill,” and the dozens of accompanying pieces of legislation creates a $43.9 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins in July, about a 3.6% increase from last year.
That includes about $16 billion in general fund spending. As it stands, the general fund would end the next fiscal year with about $2.5 million above the required reserve amount.
“I’ve said this a number of times and I will keep saying it: This is a budget that no one will like but we can all be proud of,” Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, told his colleagues in a caucus meeting on Tuesday. “That is because we took a $1.2 billion-in-the-hole starting point and have managed to deliver a budget that maintains our commitment to K-12, maintains our commitment to Medicaid and maintains our commitment to higher ed. We have done that largely through some pretty painful ongoing cuts, combined with one-time transfers.”

The budget includes $150 million in new K-12 spending and a 1.6% Medicaid provider rate increase. Those are lower increases than advocates hoped for, but it is not the apocalyptic scenario some feared. The larger picture of education funding is left to the School Finance Act, which has not yet been introduced.
The Senate gave preliminary approval to the budget on Wednesday night. It still needs to undergo a formal recorded vote before heading to the House for consideration.
It is written by the six-member, bicameral Joint Budget Committee, which includes Democrats and Republicans, after months of meetings and presentations from state departments and agencies. The primary goal this year was to craft a balanced budget as required by the state constitution while facing down a massive funding gap created by ballooning costs of state programs like Medicaid.
Part of the issue is that Colorado is constrained by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, which restricts how much revenue the state can keep based on inflation and population growth. That revenue cap is not rising as fast as those program costs, at the same time pandemic-era federal funding dries up. This year, the general fund appropriation for the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which administers Medicaid, is larger than the one for the Department of Education for the first time. It would grow by 6.8% under the proposed budget.
But TABOR limitations should not be blamed for the budget woes, Republicans argue. Rather, they say the blame should be on the expanding state government and the associated spending.
“We’ve created a structural deficit with the way we’ve been spending over the last six years. We need to restrain our spending, not claim that we need more money,” Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Monument Republican, said ahead of debate on Wednesday.
A dozen departments reduced
Most of Wednesday was spent debating amendments to the long bill, attempts by individual lawmakers to put their mark on the budget and signal the programs and investments that are important — or not — to them. That ranged from failed amendments to cease funding transgender health care in the Department of Corrections to a successful one that would create more spending for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program administration.
The House will vote on its own series of amendments to the long bill and then the bill will head to a conference committee made of JBC members. It’s rare that budget amendments stick around until the final version that heads to the governor’s desk.
Overall, about a dozen departments will see a budget reduction compared to last year.
The budget balances itself by proposing various repeals and adjustments to current programs, including some that were only recently created through legislation. One cut changes the state’s responsibility to cover 75% of phone calls for incarcerated people, instead of 100% as passed into law in 2023, and would save about $2.3 million. Another repeals the Kidney Disease Task Force formed in 2021.
The state’s transportation department is poised to absorb a large share of the budget cuts. One cut would slash about $64 million in the budget by adjusting the schedule of transfers of general fund money to the State Highway Fund, which was created through 2021 legislation that requires a certain amount of investment over a decade. The state will eventually meet that investment obligation, but on an adjusted schedule. It wouldn’t be on the hook for $50 million earmarked for next year, for example.
The budget would also eliminate $7 million for the Revitalizing Main Street program, which helps local communities improve their downtown infrastructure.
And it takes back about $71 million in awarded transportation grants to local governments for small-scale improvements like bike lanes and walking paths. That money has been awarded but the projects are not under contract.
“These are great investments, valuable stuff. But given the budget shortfall we have this year, we identified this as a place where an investment we made some years ago, we can probably put those dollars to better use this year,” Bridges said. “If you can find $72 million worth of cuts somewhere else, then let’s talk. But this is the single largest piece we will be transferring into the general fund.”
About $34 million would be cut from the Healthy School Meals for All program in the Department of Education, which provides free breakfast and lunch for public school students. It leaves $8 million to sustain the program until December. Voters will likely face a ballot question this fall proposing to raise more tax dollars to fund the program.
Senators wrestled with a cut that would repeal Medicaid coverage for services provided by community health workers as defined in a 2023 law, which would save about $11.7 million in the upcoming budget year and $13.7 million in the 2026-2027 fiscal year. That reimbursement program was passed in 2023 and was set to be implemented starting this July.
An amendment to fund community health workers for at least the first year using excess general fund reserve was approved.
“We know the benefits that community health workers are to all our communities, whether it’s Front Range or rural. They offer wraparound services, whether it’s social services, transportation, other things that lead to better outcomes for the people of Colorado,” said Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat.
Democrats control strong majorities in both the House and Senate.

(Photo: Tennessee Department of Correction)Despite a major increase in prison officer salaries, the Tennessee Department of Correction is hitting personnel shortages, forcing it to bring in a “floating security crew” at state facilities.
A five-person group of correctional officers volunteered to assist staff in March at the Northwest Correctional Complex in Tiptonville, which has capacity for 1,776 male inmates, including juvenile offenders convicted as adults, the department confirmed.
The state is hiring 20 more correctional officers to serve on the “floating security crew,” and depending on experience their pay could range from $4,675 to $5,300 a month, up to $63,600 a year, about 20% more than the average pay for officers, according to the department.
Officers on the crew travel to locations where they are needed based on staffing levels, and applications for the job are available on the Department of Correction’s website.
The department wouldn’t say whether Northwest Correctional had suffered any security breakdowns or major incidents because of the staffing shortage.
Shortages come at a time the state is requiring inmates to serve longer terms because of the so-called “truth and sentencing” law and support for a constitutional amendment that would enable judges to deny bail to more offenders.
Republican Sen. Ed Jackson of Jackson, chairman of a legislative committee on prisons, said Northwest Correctional has a history of correctional officer vacancies.
“It’s just hard to get people in that part of the state to go in as correctional officers. I know they’ve struggled up there quite a bit over the last three or four years,” Jackson said.
The state increased officer salaries and held recruiting events in West Tennessee to hire more officers, but couldn’t keep the staffing level up to standards, Jackson added. He was uncertain whether additional pay increases would solve the problem.
  “It’s just hard to get people in that part of the state” to serve as correction officers, said Sen. Ed Jackson, a Jackson Republican. (Photo: John Partipilo)
The department announced in January it was putting $37 million more into salary increases for correctional officers and security personnel, effective Feb. 16, raising starting salaries to $51,204 with additional increases that would bump pay to $60,720 after 18 months. Current staff was to see a 10% increase or be brought up to the new base salary, according to the department.
The pay increase came on the heels of a 35% pay booster two years ago.
Correction Commissioner Frank Strada told lawmakers in February state-run prisons have a 26% vacancy rate for  correction officers compared to 33.7% at Trousdale Turner, a facility run by the state’s private contractor, CoreCivic. The Trousdale prison remains under a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.
“This investment in our people recognizes the value of correctional professionals and demonstrates the support we have received from the Governor’s Office and the General Assembly,” Strada said in a January letter to employees.
Strada said in the letter the pay increase would make the Department of Correction one of the highest-paying correctional agencies in the Southeast.
The Tennessee State Employees Association called the raises an “important step” toward dealing with the challenge of recruiting and keeping employees at state prisons.
The department is requesting a $6.8 million contract increase for its private prison operator even though it penalized the company $44.78 million since 2022 for contractual shortfalls, $15 million the last month alone, mainly for personnel shortages.
CoreCivic refuses to disclose what it pays officers, and similarly to the state, it brings personnel from other states to boost staff when it has shortages. Trousdale Turner sustained a 146% turnover rate in 2023.

Nov. 9, 2021 | Ken ColemanThe abrupt closure of a regional office for the federal agency overseeing Head Start child care and early education programs in Michigan could lead to disruptions in service.
The National Head Start Association said the Chicago office overseeing programs in six states, including Michigan, was abruptly shuttered earlier this week as part of Health Secretary Robert Kennedy’s cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Administration for Children and Families, or ACF, the agency that administers the Office of Head Start.
Chicago’s office also oversees programs in Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin.
A statement from the NHSA warned that the closures could cause “disruption to vital services for eligible children and families across the country.”
Aundreana Jones-Poole, a communications manager for the Michigan Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential, or MiLEAP, said the state “is working to understand the impact of this week’s federal actions on Michigan families at this time.”
Four other regional offices were also shuttered Tuesday. Regional offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco and Seattle faced the same fate as the Chicago office, according to the NHSA.
Josh Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, said the closures create “a walk the walk moment for anyone claiming to care about kids and families.”
The NHSA said the regional offices “play a critical role in providing oversight, guidance and direct support to local Head Start programs,” including helping to interpret federal regulations and providing support to Head Start grant recipients.
There are 53 Head Start providers in Michigan. More than 70,000 children in Michigan are served by the federal Head Start and Child Development and Care programs, Jones-Poole said.
“In order to avoid disrupting services for children and families, we urge the administration to reconsider these actions until a plan has been created and shared widely,” the NHSA’s statement reads.
But Cowen, who has written extensively on efforts to undermine public education, said the administration of President Donald Trump “isn’t interested in policy solutions for kids and families that aren’t built on moms staying at home or tax dollars going to private schools.”
“I interpret anything other than strong statements condemning the closing of ACF offices as support for doing it—and by extension support for gutting Head Start, child care and the rest,” Cowen said.
The Head Start program was created 60 years ago to provide early education and other support for children living in low-income households.

March 25, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The path forward for a medical cannabis bill in the Nebraska Legislature appears more uncertain after a committee chair tasked his members with deciding what medical conditions would qualify for access in the state and which forms of medical cannabis would be allowed.
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee, described that task to his seven fellow committee members Wednesday. He provided them lists to choose a handful from the “debilitating medical conditions” approved in neighboring Iowa, as well as what he said were the 42 conditions approved across the 38 other states with medical cannabis laws.
  State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, center. March 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Holdcroft described the comprehensive list as “everything but the kitchen sink” in talking with the Nebraska Examiner, explaining that the “people were silent” on what medical conditions would apply when they overwhelmingly adopted legalizing medical cannabis in November.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” Holdcroft said, a stance advocates of the ballot measure argue is wrong.
Legislative Bill 677, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, an effort aiming to flesh out a state regulatory scheme for medical cannabis, already faced an uphill climb to get out of committee among conservatives. Hansen, a Republican with a more Libertarian bent, said he still hopes to get his bill out of committee as “clean and popular as we can.”
Some advocates who championed the 2024 ballot measure say their support of the bill could be in jeopardy if Holdcroft’s more limited approach is taken up. They and Hansen continue to hunt for a path forward that remains closer to voters’ intent.
“It’s almost like whatever we kick out of committee is going to be ‘the’ bill that I would like to see, that the industry would like to see, that the people who voted for it would like to see,” Hansen said. “And that the Legislature can live with, at least 33 people can.”
Holdcroft voiced his goal to get an amended version of LB 677 advanced by the end of next week. Any version would need at least five votes.
‘The people have spoken’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana and 2024 campaign manager for the ballot measure, said the task that Holdcroft gave to his committee is disrespectful and that those concessions, among others, should be off the table.
She said advocates didn’t work so hard, gathering petition signatures and stories of pain and suffering from Nebraskans, to let a few senators decide who should be helped. Eggers has advocated on behalf of her youngest son, Colton, and said she’d never tell someone one child’s life was more worthy than someone else’s.
“Shame on them for trying to do that,” Eggers said.

Eggers thanked Hansen for all his work in hearing from supporters, respecting ballot language and helping advocates. But she said the time for other lawmakers to voice opinions on what is “right” is long overdue.
Lawmakers had their chance, but they repeatedly pushed supporters away, Eggers explained, and “essentially shut the door on our face each and every time” until the ballot was the only option.
The measure to legalize up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a health care practitioner’s recommendation passed with more than 71% of the vote, including majority support in all 49 legislative districts. A second measure, to set up the regulatory scheme through a new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, passed with 67%. It got majority support in 46 legislative districts.
Eggers said that while the campaign thought companion legislation to clarify the state’s regulatory approach could be a “best scenario” to help enact the will of the people, she said some lawmakers had gone too far.
“We are not in a position any longer, now that the people have spoken, to let our initiative be gutted into something that is not at all what the people passed,” Eggers said.
‘Keep it small, keep it restricted’
Holdcroft said he would like his committee to wade through the lists and identify about six conditions that would qualify for access to medical cannabis, though he said he wouldn’t object to the Iowa list of:

Cancer, if the underlying condition or treatment produces severe or chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, or cachexia or severe wasting.
Seizures, including epilepsy.
Multiple sclerosis with severe or persistent muscle spasms.
AIDS or HIV.
Crohn’s disease.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig’s disease.
Any terminal illness, with a probable life expectancy of under one year, if the illness or its treatment produces severe or chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, or cachexia or severe wasting.
Parkinson’s disease.
Chronic pain.
Post-traumatic stress disorder.
Severe, intractable autism with self-injurious or aggressive behaviors (including pediatric).
Ulcerative colitis.
Corticobasal degeneration.

Iowa state law also creates a path to expanding conditions via a recommendation by the Iowa Medical Cannabidiol Board and later adoption by the Iowa Board of Medicine.
“I think the approach should be: Keep it small, keep it restricted and do floor amendments if they want to expand it,” Holdcroft said.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
According to Holdcroft’s second list, cancer, epilepsy or seizures and HIV or AIDS are listed in “every” state; multiple sclerosis is listed in “nearly” all states; chronic pain, PTSD and Chrohn’s disease or inflammatory bowel disease are listed in “most” states; and Parkinson’s disease, glaucoma or ALS are listed in “many” states.
Other conditions on Holdcroft’s lists range from sleep apnea, menstrual pain, sickle cell disease, tinnitus or “any condition for which a physician would otherwise prescribe an opioid” to Lewy body disease, Alzheimer’s, addiction recovery, hepatitis C or Huntington’s disease.
“Conditions like severe nausea, cachexia/wasting syndrome and terminal illness are also frequently included,” Holdcroft’s handouts state.
Holdcroft said three conditions are likely must-haves: childhood epilepsy, terminal cancer and lifelong chronic pain.
Part of that is because children with debilitating seizures were the face of the campaign, as moms and dads led the charge for more than 11 years at the statehouse.
One condition that Holdcroft cast doubt on and said would need to be more specific: PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder.
Holdcroft said the lists are not final, or even preliminary, but should serve as a starting point.
‘Do as little as necessary’
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, committee vice chair, said lawmakers should do as little as needed to give structure to voters’ wishes but not “undermine” or “walk back” their will. He noted voters purposefully approved up to 5 ounces of cannabis and no specific conditions.
Edison McDonald, executive director of the Arc of Nebraska, said during the bill’s hearing not to limit the conditions to prevent needing annual bills to expand the list.

Cavanaugh said the arbitrary deliberations could exclude voters who specifically supported the measures for themselves or loved ones.
“I think when you start picking arbitrary numbers of maladies that will qualify, that is a disservice,” he said.
Cavanaugh said he always thinks of one of his constituents alongside marijuana regulations. He described her as somebody’s grandma in a fancy house in the Dundee neighborhood in Omaha, “not somebody you would necessarily think of as an advocate for legal cannabis.” She was, he said, for her husband who had stomach cancer and had tried many drugs to help.
Cavanaugh’s district in midtown Omaha had the highest support for the regulatory measure.
“My approach would be to do as little as necessary to make sure that people are going to be able to access this safely and legally,” Cavanaugh said.
He suggested delegating authority for putting together or researching qualifying conditions to the new Medical Cannabis Commission.
What senators can ‘live with’
Hansen said he is working hard with committee members to see what they can “live with,” but if those changes differ with what he or advocates can live with, then the bill will be adjusted during debate.
However, as recent filibuster-plagued sessions have shown, opponents can use legislative rules to block how many amendments can be added, further complicating the bill’s path toward securing the 33 votes it would need to become law.
Under the Nebraska Constitution, amending voter-approved laws requires two-thirds of the 49-member Legislature.
  State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, left, leans in to listen to State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln at a legislative retreat in Kearney on Friday, Dec. 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hansen said it may be necessary to get something passed first, to set up the rules and regulations and get the framework established, and not “eat the whole apple in one setting.”
Hansen repeated the importance of getting something passed in 2025 as the voter-approved regulatory law is set to take effect in less than three months, making it virtually impossible for the new Medical Cannabis Commission — which has taken zero steps toward regulations — to have formal guidance in place by July 1. State licensing is supposed to begin by Oct. 1.
The Attorney General’s Office has threatened to sue if the cannabis commission begins licensing.
Holdcroft said the bill being considered would delay both the regulatory and licensing deadlines by at least three months.
The law legalizing medical cannabis with a written doctor’s note took effect Dec. 12, in all forms and for all conditions. However, with no guidance from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, many advocates have told the Nebraska Examiner that doctors are refusing to recommend the drug that would need to be purchased out of state.
Holdcroft has suggested lowering the 5-ounce authorization to 300 milligrams, a limit that was suggested by freshman State Sen. Jared Storm of David City via LB 483. Holdcroft also suggested beginning at pills, oils or tinctures as part of Storm’s bill and expanding from there.
Smoking as a permissible form of use is a roadblock for a majority of the committee.

Recreational marijuana
Much of the hesitation revolves around fear of legalizing recreational marijuana, which Hansen noted many on the committee “vehemently oppose” — as do Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., who are urging the Legislature to pass no cannabis-related laws this spring.
Hansen said avoidance could risk potential legal challenges or public backlash, one of the “fastest ways” he said to get voters to consider recreational marijuana.
“One of the fastest tracks of that happening in Nebraska is not doing what the people voted for or cutting this way too short or restricting it too much, or not passing something at all,” Hansen said.
Hansen said that if that did happen, he wouldn’t be surprised if come November 2026, voters are left weighing whether to approve recreational marijuana. The Blair senator has described the path ahead, with no law change, where the commission could continue to have no funds and no way to do its job, as the “Wild West.”

(Mario Tama | Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.











We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis



Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

(Peter Cade/Getty Images)Two days after a federal judge permanently blocked Arkansas’ Social Media Safety Act, state lawmakers filed two bills Wednesday aimed at expanding social media protections for children.
Senate Bill 611 would amend Act 689 of 2023 (the Social Media Safety Act), apparently to address some of the judge’s reasons for ruling as he did. Act 689 was the first of its kind in the nation and was a priority of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her first year in office. It required social media platforms to verify the age of new account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission.
Senate Bill 612 would create a right for parents to sue social media platforms if their child develops eating disorders, self-harms, commits or tries to commit suicide, or becomes addicted to the platform’s feeds because of content the child was exposed to. 
Both bills establish a civil penalty of $10,000 per violation.

Sen. Tyler Dees, R-Siloam Springs, and Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, are chief sponsors of both bills. 
In January, Sanders called on the Legislature to amend the Social Media Safety Act so it wouldn’t be held up in court any longer. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks of the Western District of Arkansas had temporarily blocked it in August 2023, shortly before it was to take effect. Brooks on Monday ruled that law violated the First Amendment and the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution.
Sanders also asked lawmakers in January to create a right for parents to sue social media platforms if their children kill themselves because of content encouraging them to self-harm. The governor noted the presence of a woman in the gallery whose child died by suicide.
 In a press release Wednesday announcing the filing of SB 611 and 612, Sanders noted that Arkansas “has led the nation on commonsense, conservative reforms to protect kids online, and these additional protections continue that effort.”
“Moms and dads whose kids have fallen victim to Big Tech deserve the right to take action against these abusive companies – and Arkansas law should protect kids so they aren’t subjected to toxic material in the first place.”
Eubanks and Dees echoed Sanders’ comments.
“This legislation keeps our children safe online, and puts their safety where it should be — in the hands of parents,” Eubanks said in the press release.  
SB 612 “establishes a private right of action for parents whose child commits suicide or attempts suicide because of his or her exposure to toxic material on social media, allowing them to sue abusive Big Tech companies in state court,” Sanders’ press release says.
The amendments to Act 689 in SB 611 more clearly define social media and apply the definition to more platforms, lower the age of minor users to 16, prohibit social media algorithms from targeting minors, and add a penalty for companies that do not comply, according to the press release.
The regulations would apply only to new accounts, it said.
This new legislation follows Sanders’ signing of the Bell to Bell, No Cell Act in February that bans personal electronic devices, including cell phones and smart watches, in schools. That bill was also sponsored by Dees and Eubanks.

The move to table the controversial measure Wednesday in the Senate State and Local Government Committee came at the request of its chairman.  
Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, cited his neighbor from Canada, an engineer who is at risk of being unable to renew her visa before it expires due to bureaucratic delays resulting from actions taken by the Department of Government Efficiency. Briggs said he was concerned the law could sweep up immigrants like her.
Bill giving immigrants without legal status 72 hours to leave Tennessee advances in House

The bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. Jack Johnson of Franklin, acknowledged the measure runs afoul of established law and a 2012 Supreme Court decision that said states cannot usurp the federal government’s exclusive power to enact immigration enforcement laws. Rep. Lee Reeves, a Franklin Republican, cosponsored the bill, but noted the bill would take effect only in certain circumstances.
The bill was crafted as a “trigger” law, only going into effect if one of three things happened: the Supreme Court overturned its 2012 decision, the U.S. Constitution is amended or similar laws enacted by other states remain in effect for 60 days.
Sponsors of the bill said it was intended to “demagnetize” Tennessee as a destination for immigrants who lack legal status and immigrant advocates called it “incredibly inhumane” legislation that put families living in Tennessee at risk.

(Photo: John Partipilo)I was a decent Math student until around the ninth grade. I could add, subtract, multiply, and divide quickly and efficiently in my head. Most of that talent was due to scouring baseball box scores in my local paper every afternoon. 
Basic mental math was fairly simple for me, but algebra was  different. There’s some nuance to Algebra – a necessary depth of thought required to arrive at a final answer. 
I hadn’t thought much about math until a recent bill sponsored by Rep. Chris Todd and Sen. Brent Taylor passed a House Subcommittee despite legitimate concerns from faith-based organizations and nonprofits.
The bill would create a Class A misdemeanor to “harbor or hide” someone unlawfully present in the U.S., with a $1,000 penalty and up to a year in jail for each individual who was concealed, harbored or shielded — one would even be liable for knowing a person was in the country without legal status.  A “human smuggling” offense was also tacked onto an already established law of human trafficking. At first glance, it was another example of Todd’s basic political math formula: add one more piece of legislation to an existing law to solve a “problem.” 
Three years ago, Todd, a Jackson Republican, sponsored legislation to “create an offense for a person who engages in an adult cabaret performance on public property or in a location where the adult cabaret performance could be viewed by a person who is not an adult.” 
Tennessee bill to criminalize ‘harboring or hiding” immigrants without legal status advances

Tennessee already had laws pertaining to public decency, including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, public lewdness and even urinating in public. Todd’s bill targeted the LGBTQ+ community, adding another measure  to constrict an already marginalized group. 
Basic political math: add more laws directly affecting groups of people you disagree with and hope it forces them back into the shadows.
After a mass shooting at Nashville’s Covenant School two years ago, Gov. Bill Lee called a special legislative session  to ostensibly create a few safeguards for responsible gun ownership. Todd, however, sponsored a measure  allowing certain school employees to openly carry firearms in schools or at school events.
 Basic political math: more good guys with guns will solve the problem of bad guys with guns. 
For a long time, I’ve chalked these bills up to Todd simply not being nuanced or creative enough to understand the impact his legislation would have, but I was terribly wrong. He knows exactly what he’s doing and does it well. 
On the surface, there are many parts of current laws and pending GOP legislation that everyone — Republican, Democrat, or Independent—should support. 
No one should want children unprotected in a school, posing as easy targets for a person with a firearm. No one should want children exposed to salacious acts of inappropriate sexuality in public spaces. No one should believe it’s okay for a person to commit violent crimes — U.S. citizen or non-citizen. No one should want immigrants “smuggled” or taken advantage of by an industry or company seeking cheap labor. No one should want adults or children trafficked or prostituted. 
But that’s why the “basic math” approach of legislation is so insidious: it takes problematic issues that every Tennessean hopes to avoid and presents faux solutions by advancing a fundamentally conservative agenda while hurting a vulnerable population of people in our state by capitalizing on exaggerated or even blatantly false narratives. 
The most recent piece of legislation by Todd and Taylor, a Memphis Republican, is easy to support at first glance.but the addendum that is most concerning is the one threatening a misdemeanor charge for aiding immigrants without permanent legal status. 
This is where the approach of basic math runs its course, and some much-needed algebraic nuance is required. 
Immigration is a complex subject with more gray areas than black and white. When there are more questions than answers, addendums like the one above to a mostly reasonable, if not redundant, bill create valid worry and concern based on the rhetoric of President Donald Trump  and any lawmaker who openly supports him. 
I teach at a school with many new students who don’t speak much English. I attend a church that supports a non-profit that helps undocumented immigrants find pathways to full citizenship. If I were to find out one of my students or their families were not citizens, would I be subjected to a one thousand dollar fine? More importantly, what would happen to migrants who are not full citizens but on a pathway to citizenship? Is the intent of this bill to truly protect the vulnerable population of immigrants in Tennessee or another way to further a malevolent movement to remove children and families from our state and country?
Based on recent voting patterns by our supermajority, I already know the answer to that question. It’s as easy as one plus one.

Kennedy Jr. appeared on stage together in Martinsburg wearing matching green hats that read “Make America Healthy Again.” Morrisey was present to show support for the Trump administration’s “MAHA” plan, and RFK Jr. responded by publicly shaming him over his weight — mocking his appearance, offering to put him on a diet and even mentioning a specific amount of weight he needed to lose.
This is not an unfamiliar dynamic in West Virginia politics. Jim Justice’s weight has long been an easy talking point, a cheap insult and topic of fatphobic political cartoons for people across the political spectrum. West Virginia itself is often called one of the nation’s “fattest states” due to high obesity rates, while also experiencing some of the worst health outcomes.
But what does this mean when the scientific relationship between fatness and health is more complicated than it initially seems? According to the Association for Size Diversity and Health (ASDH), “Efforts to make fat people thin fail over and over. And in fact we have decades of research on diets and “lifestyle changes” that show that, while people can intentionally lose weight for six months to one year, they eventually regain most, all, or even more than they initially lost.”
The impact of weight on health gets even more convoluted when the health impacts of fatphobia are included. In their paper “Whatever I said didn’t register with her”: medical fatphobia and interactional and relational disconnect in healthcare encounters”, researchers Carolin Kost, Kimberly Jamie, and Elizabeth Mohr found that fat people “frequently experience negative and highly stigmatizing health care encounters,” which can “compound and worsen disordered eating, trigger mental health problems, and lead to health care avoidance.” Fatphobia itself can actually be one of the causes of worse health outcomes.
Much has been (rightfully) made of RFK Jr.’s talk of wellness camps and banning SSRIs. But his views on “obesity” are dangerous as well: in his confirmation hearing, RFK Jr. calls it an “existential threat” to America. The very same politicians who decry obesity are the same ones who tout things like raw milk and ivermectin.
It can be tempting to look at two tenuously linked factors like weight and health and focus on “solving” one to address the other. But why not start with the things proven to improve health: clean air and water, well-priced food and fair wages, accessible and affordable medical care, stable housing, free child care and paid time off for all, etc? These calls to eradicate a certain size and shape of person should be concerning to us all. The desire to control people’s bodies — by taking away the right to abortion, by criminalizing unhoused people and people who use drugs, by attempting to ban trans health care, and by attempting to eradicate fat people — all come from the same authoritarian project.
Finally, when you use fatphobic rhetoric to insult politicians, even harmful ones, they are usually not the ones hearing it — your fat friends, family members and community members are. It shows that fat bodies are acceptable sites for mockery and derision, just like the rest of the marginalized people Trump and his appointees are targeting. Together, we can demand more to improve our state’s health — and there are much more creative insults out there anyway.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
GOP changes to Medicaid in doubt after Democrat Beshear says legislature failed to fund them

Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.




Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families




Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Image via Maine Turnpike Authority)Lawmakers from southern Maine have banned together on legislation to scrap the controversial Gorham Connector project that sought to expand suburban access to I-95.
While she knows the region needs a solution for traffic congestion driven by population growth, “the connector is not the solution,” said Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland), lead sponsor on the bill that is set to have a public hearing before the Transportation Committee Thursday afternoon. 
In 2017, the Maine Legislature passed legislation that allowed the Turnpike Authority to review traffic conditions west of Portland in Gorham, Scarborough, South Portland and Westbrook and build a five-mile connector to mitigate backups. Then-Gov. Paul LePage vetoed the bill because it was a toll access road, but lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to override his objection.
When that law was passed, traffic projections were much higher than what is seen today, Brenner said. Traffic modeling assumes steady growth, she explained, but the reality depends on shifts in commuting patterns, land use and transportation choices, so it’s important to base infrastructure designs on the most up-to-date data. 
Brenner said she heard concerns from residents and key municipalities “loudly” on the campaign trail last summer. 
Opponents have said it is too large of a fix for a problem that only occurs at limited times in certain areas, according to reporting from the Portland Press Herald. And Brenner also pointed out that any route for the connector would cut through Smiling Hill Farm in Westbrook, a family-owned dairy farm and valued part of the community. Preserving local businesses and working landscapes is important when planning for future transportation needs, she said.
The Gorham Connector would have linked the Maine Turnpike at Exit 45 to the Gorham Bypass off Route 114. The intention was to improve the connection to the Turnpike and I-295 while reducing the commuter traffic on neighborhood roads. 
With an estimated cost of at least $330 million, Brenner said there should be careful consideration of the investment, especially when studies from the Turnpike Authority show a new highway would only reduce commute times by an average of four minutes. 
“Repealing the law allows for a fresh approach to transportation planning, ensuring that any future proposals align with community needs and priorities,” she said. 
“Hundreds of constituents have contributed their time and voices into opposing this project and have asked for this bill to be brought forward.”
LD 1020 would create that blank slate by repealing the 2017 law. It would also require the Turnpike Authority to resell any land purchased for the project back to the previous owner.
If the previous owner doesn’t want the property back, the bill stipulates that it would then be given to the municipality at no cost. If the municipality doesn’t want the land, it would need to donate it to a local land trust. If they also don’t want the land, then it can be offered for sale at a public auction.
Other Democrats from that corner of the state have signed on to the bill, including Sen. Anne Carney of Cumberland County, and Reps. Drew Gattine of Westbrook, Kelly Murphy and Sophie Warren of Scarborough, as well as Eleanor Sato and Parnell Terry of Gorham. Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono) is also a cosponsor. 
Transportation officials agreed in early March to consider alternative plans for addressing traffic west of Portland. The Turnpike Authority asked the Maine Department of Transportation to do a two-year comprehensive review of the benefits and limitations of changing the existing infrastructure, as well as gather input from people affected by the traffic in that area. 
Although the landscape has evolved due to factors such as changes in post-pandemic commuting and the state’s housing crisis, the Turnpike Authority said there could still be a need for an “innovative transportation solution” for that area.
Rather than expanding highways, Brenner said there should be an effort to strengthen existing urban areas, improve mobility options and support local economies. 
“Thoughtful, data-driven planning will help ensure the best outcomes for the region’s future,” she said.

(File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)A committee hearing on a bill to limit the state’s financial liabilities in sex abuse lawsuits ended in an emotional vote Wednesday with one member walking out in anger and another casting a vote in tears.
Lawmakers are scrambling in the final days of the session to pass legislation that could tame potentially crushing payouts to thousands of people who allege they were sexually assaulted as children in state facilities.
“I think this is perhaps a responsible way of dealing with it … it is a reasonable compromise,” said Del. Jon Cardin (D-Baltimore County).
The bill was voted out of the House Judiciary Committee along mostly party lines, and could be before the full House possibly as soon as Thursday. The Senate has yet to take up the bill. Just five days remain in the 2025 session.
Currently, sexual abuse lawsuits filed under the Child Victims Act of 2023 are capped at $890,000 for claims against government agencies and $1.5 million for claims against private institutions. The bill approved in committee Wednesday would lower the maximum payouts for cases filed after May 31 to $400,000 against governments and $700,000 against private institutions.
Additionally, the bill says one payout would cover all abuse incidents involving the same claimant and abuser. The 2023 law leaves open the potential that a court or jury would apply the maximum compensation amount to each instance of abuse.
The changes also cap fees for attorneys at 20% for cases that settle out of court and 25% for cases that result from a court judgment.
The bill wold alter 2023 Child Victims Act, which eliminated restrictions on when a survivor could file a lawsuit, opening the door to claims for abuse that happened decades ago.
At the time that law passed, most of the focus was on institutional abuse allegations connected to the Catholic Church. But the law also lifted restrictions on suing government agencies. Thousands of claims have since been made against Maryland state government.
Those claims raised concerns about the potential for billions in payouts — an amount some, including Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), who sponsored the 2023 law, feared could bankrupt a state already facing a budget crisis.
Del. Robin L. Grammer (R-Baltimore County) said he believed the state shouldn’t be allowed to evade its responsibility to compensate those abused while in state custody, but added he is skeptical of the reported high dollar costs of such cases.
“So the governor’s slogan is leave nobody behind, and I think today, we’re leaving victims behind. We were told the solution to this problem is to pass the legislation,” Grammer said. “Now, when we’re surprised by the liability of the state, we’re told it’s to minimize the liability, and it’s not about the money.”
Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) called the bill offensive to victims. She  later walked out of the committee meeting before casting her vote.
During a floor speech Wednesday evening, Arikan counted herself among those who have been abused. In an exchange with a reporter, she said she had been “molested as a young child,” and said that experience was part of what ultimately caused her to walk out of the Judiciary Committee earlier in the day.
Arikan’s staetment came during floor debate on a bill to create a state reparations commission to study inequities faced by African descendants in Maryland. Arikan had offered an amendment, which ultimately failed,  to create a panel to look at appropriate compensation for survivors of sexual abuse while in state custody.
Arikan said that while Wilson — who has said he, too, suffered physical and sexual abuse as a child — has repeatedly said his efforts with the 2023 law were never about financial compensation for survivors,  “I think it’s offensive to think that one victim speaks for all victims.”
A number of Democrats who voted for the bill in committee said it was a tough decision, but expressed concerns about the potential costs to the state.
Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery County) said the state “does not have the option of bankruptcy to run from our obligations the way our private counterparts do.” Moon voted to move the bill out of committee “with great regret … and apologies to the victims.”
For some, it was an emotional vote.
“I’m a ‘yes’ because I know we have to do something,” said Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), who began sobbing as she attempted to explain her decision to support the bill. During her explanation, and after, members of the committee attempted to console her.
Despite the lowered caps for private institutions that was included in the bill, it did not garner support from the Maryland Catholic Conference. In a statement, it criticized the bill for being rammed through in the late days of the session “with little time for careful debate or necessary revisions.”
The conference — the public policy arm of the archdioceses of Baltimore, Washington and Wilmington — noted that the state is making the change after thousands of claims were made against the state under the law.
“In fact, the Maryland state government now appears to be the largest employer of child sex abusers in the state,” the Catholic Conference statement said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/House-of-Delegates-wide-shot-newsletter-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

Areas of North Carolina surrounding a proposed pipeline project would suffer from further environmental pollution, according to a report released this week by the Sierra Club.
The Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP) to the Williams Company’s Transco Pipeline system is a pipeline running from Virginia to Alabama that would move up to 1.5 billion cubic feet of methane gas each day.
It’s an expansion of an existing pipeline that runs from the Gulf Coast to New York, transporting about a third of the gas used in the country.
SSEP is the largest new pipeline project on the East Coast since the Mountain Valley Pipeline and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both of which were started in 2014.
Williams proposed SSEP to provide more energy reliability in the region. The pipeline would add the enough natural gas to serve approximately 9.8 million homes, according to Williams’ website.
The project would have detrimental effects on North Carolina, especially for low-income residents and communities of color, which would be disproportionately affected, environmental leaders said at a press conference on Wednesday.
“We are already overburdened by industrial pollution,” said Crystal Cavalier-Keck, director and co-founder of 7 Directions of Service, an indigenous-led collective focusing on environmental justice. “These communities are treated as sacrifice zones for fossil fuel expansion with little to no say in the decision-making process.”
Cavalier-Keck, a citizen of the Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation, said she lives in a frontline community of the kind that are highly exposed to the impacts of environmental hazards and climate change.
Emissions from gas transported by the pipeline would be incompatible with meeting North Carolina’s climate goals, the report found.
SSEP includes a section called the Salem Loop, which would add 24 miles of 42″-wide pipeline in Guilford, Forsyth, and Davidson counties in North Carolina.
Another expansion, known as the Eden Loop, brings about an additional 31 miles of 42″-wide pipeline, primarily in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, but crossing into Rockingham County, North Carolina.
“That’s 55 miles of new pipeline total that would be located largely alongside existing pipeline,” Alison Kirsch, senior energy campaigns analyst for the Sierra Club, said. “Air pollution is already bad in the areas where Transco is proposing to build SSEP, including in low-income- and communities of color.”
North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality will need to consider air and water quality permit applications for SSEP. Environmentalists are urging DEQ to factor in the threats that the project poses to the air and water sources of local communities.
The Sierra Club encouraged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to conduct a more nuanced environmental justice analysis than Transco did, including considering an environmental impact statement.
Aminah Ghaffar-Fulp, policy director for 7 Directions of Service, emphasized the importance of acknowledging the real communities that will be impacted by the project regardless of any economic or monetary benefits.
“This is a dangerous project is going to cause a lot of harm in communities that already have a bunch of polluters, particularly Black, indigenous and low-income communities, and there’s nothing that can change the negative environmental impact that this is going to have,” she said. “Regardless of how much money it might look like it’s going to bring to the state, it is really just going to line the pockets of certain companies… the overall impact is not worth the sacrifice.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Transco-pipeline.png,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

Nicholaus R. Kipke (R-Anne Arundel) tells the House on Wednesday that ""information got to me late"" on why he introduced a bill with less than a week left in the legislative session April 7. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Republicans did not suggest that Gov. Wes Moore (D) had done anything illegal by being the “featured speaker” at a  political action committee fundraiser Wednesday during the legislative session, when fundraising is generally prohibited — but they said it didn’t pass the “smell test.”
That’s why GOP lawmakers in both the House and the Senate tried to introduce emergency bills Wednesday to prohibit such an appearance in no uncertain terms.
“We have laws prohibiting all state lawmakers and the governor from fundraising during the legislative session. These laws were established for one simple reason, and that’s to avoid even the appearance of impropriety,” said Sen. Jason C. Gallion (R-Harford and Cecil), who introduced a bill in the Senate. Del. Nicholaus Kipke (R-Allegany) introduced a companion bill in the House.
“Some political consultants and PAC leaders – they’ll say it’s legal,” he said of Moore’s appearance. “But at least, it does not live up to the spirit of our law. And it definitely does not pass the smell test, especially in the last week of our legislative session.”
  Sen. Jason C. Gallion (R-Harford and Cecil). Photo by Bryan P. Sears).
But with just days left in the session, Democrats said there was not enough time to consider the bills, particularly with more pressing issues like the budget and energy reform still hanging.
“We have a lot of major issues to take on, this would not even apply in the next five days,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson  (D-Baltimore City) in response to a move to fast-track Gallion’s bill.
The bills were a response to Moore’s appearance Wednesday as the featured speaker at a fundraiser held by Unity First PAC, which was created in April 2024, largely to campaign against former Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) efforts to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2024. Hogan lost to now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D), but the PAC is still doing business.
Maryland laws prohibit legislators, the governor and other state officials from fundraising during the legislative sessions, and while Republican lawmakers feel that would also prohibit Moore’s activities Wednesday evening, the emergency legislation would lay it out explicitly.
Gallion introduced a bill to prohibit legislators or statewide elected officials like the governor from taking part “in a fundraising event as a featured guest or speaker or in another role intended to increase attendance at or the amount of contributions resulting from” the event if it’s held during a legislative session.
Late-filled bills are supposed to go the House or Senate Rules committees, which decide if they are allowed to be assigned to a committee to being the process of jumping through the usual legislative hurdles of committee hearings and floor discussion on the way to becoming law.
With the 2025 General Assembly scheduled to ende at midnight Monday, Gallion hoped to convince senators to bypass the Rules Committee so his bill could go straight to committee hearings.
“The overall issue is something that I know everyone in this room take very seriously,” Gallion said, arguing that the “dark money loophole” needs to be closed “immediately.”
Democratic senators agreed the issue needs to be looked at but said Gallion’s bill was too late to get through the process, and too late to do anything about the Wednesday PAC event.
“Even if we went through the trouble of hearing this bill, it’s too late, the fundraiser is already planned,” Finance Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) said. “I think this can wait until next year when we aren’t so busy. We’re just swamped with still getting bills out for a vote. I just don’t think we need this interruption that we can’t fix immediately.”
Moore’s PAC launches first attack on Hogan

Majority Leader Stephen S. Hershey (R-Upper Shore) argued the bill is not necessarily focused on the Unity First PAC event but would put a stop to similar events down the line.
“Legal or not, it certainly appears to be unethical,” Hershey said. “This makes sure that we are holding the governor to the same standard that we are — that you’re not fundraising during session. That is something that just doesn’t look appropriate.”
The move to bypass Rules for Gallion’s bill failed 12-34. The House also sent Kipke’s version of the bill to the Rules and Executive Nominations Committee Wednesday.
Kipke was not hopeful Wednesday.
“I don’t anticipate the legislature taking it up because of how short a time we have left,” Kipke said. “I would like to get a hearing, and I will be seeking a hearing from the leaders of the General Assembly. I’ll be talking to them throughout the course of the day. I do think it’s something that has bipartisan support.”
And if that doesn’t work, he plans to push the issue again next year.
“If it doesn’t pass this session, I’ll be introducing it next year,” Kipke said. “The legislature should embrace the blanket prohibition because it’s just the right thing to do.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Del.-Nicholaus-R.-Kipke-4-2-2025-1024x590.jpg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

John Hickenlooper, seen during a rally at CS Wind in Pueblo on Nov. 29, 2023, has voted in favor of the Trump administration's agenda with unexpected frequency. (Mike Sweeney for Colorado Newsline)Last week, as the U.S. Senate voted to approve President Donald Trump’s pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, Colorado’s junior senator “agonized” over what to do, he told a reporter. He voted “no,” but during a committee hearing he had previously voted in favor of nominee Martin Makary, and he “could have easily gone back and voted yes” during the floor vote, he said.
This episode helps illustrate why Hickenlooper, who is up for reelection next year, is supremely vulnerable to a primary challenge, despite the Democrat’s long record of success in Colorado politics. In the Trump era, when many left-leaning voters in blue states like Colorado are terrified of the federal government and furious about America’s transition to authoritarianism, Hickenlooper has failed to adopt the resistance spirit that the state’s left-leaning residents increasingly demand of officeholders and candidates. 
In fact, he has supported Trump’s agenda more than any other Democratic senator in Washington as measured against home-state presidential vote share.
Primary candidates in the U.S. Senate race in Colorado, no matter their other qualifications, will start their campaigns with a powerful political argument against the incumbent. And that’s just one reason we should expect Hickenlooper to face a robust contest for his seat in 2026.

By the time Makary’s Senate vote arrived, it was clear that the Trump administration was embarked on an aggressive campaign to reshape the federal government as an anti-democratic, anti-constitutional operation that would strip Americans of the services and support they had come to rely on and serve only Trump’s friends and loyal oligarchs. 
Many of their Colorado constituents were looking to Hickenlooper and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet to “obstruct everything,” since they viewed the entirety of the Trump agenda as so fundamentally destructive.
Within a week, Makary proved the wisdom of the obstruct-everything posture. His very first major act as Trump’s FDA commissioner was to approve the firing of the agency’s respected longtime top vaccine official, fueling fears that Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Health and Human Services Department is basing national policy on vaccine conspiracy theories.
And on Tuesday, the department began firing thousands of workers, including 2,500 under Makary’s leadership, which critics say will hurt the well-being of Americans.
But Hickenlooper had been voting to confirm odious Trump nominees since the beginning of the administration. They include Secretary of State Marco Rubio (champion of free speech-suppressing arrests of students and politically-based deportation of activists), Energy Secretary Chris Wright (a climate arsonist), and CIA director John Ratcliffe (participant in the infamous national security breach on a Signal chat who then lied to Congress about the contents of the chat). 
Hickenlooper’s votes in the Senate on lower-level appointees, procedural motions and legislation have also contributed to the charge that he is failing to meet the moment.
Even when he’s back home in Colorado talking to constituents, Hickenlooper can appear oblivious to the threats that face the country. During a meeting in Aurora last month with veterans, who complained to Hickenlooper that Trump administration funding cuts and layoffs have adversely affected their health care access, the Democrat talked about his good relationship with Republican senators and suggested that as soon as they heard the vets’ stories they’d be unhappy — as if the adverse effects would be news to them despite widespread coverage of the consequences of such cuts. As if congressional Republicans in the majority had not all but ceded their power to the executive branch under Trump. As if there was any appetite among left-leaning Colorado for Hickenlooper’s collegiality with members of a party that’s effectively a personality cult.
Hickenlooper so far will face two Democratic candidates in 2026, according to Federal Election Commission records. They are Boulder university student Nichole Miner and attorney and professor Karen Breslin, who also challenged Bennet in 2022. There is still time for other Democrats to join the race and establish strong campaigns.
Hickenlooper’s misalignment with the electorate is hardly the only reason for someone to mount a primary challenge. He will be 74 years old by the time of next year’s election, and another six-year term will see him reach 80. President Joe Biden, whose apparent age-related decline forced him out of the presidential race last year only months before the election, undercut his successor’s chance to mount a convincing challenge to Trump and demonstrated in catastrophic fashion the hazards of politicians overextending their service. Many Coloradans would be grateful to Hickenlooper if he simply retired.
There’s also a basic democratic value to consider. No elected official in America — notwithstanding recent MAGA rhetoric, such as about a third term for Trump — is entitled to their office. Every elected official should be challenged at every opportunity, especially at election time, to justify their status as wielders of public power. 
Politicians work for the people, and they are obliged on a routine basis to make an honest case to the people for their fitness as representatives in government.
A primary contest is the best way to get Hickenlooper to answer for his performance.

Sears/Maryland Matters)The Board of Public Works approved a $3.9 million extension Wednesday of a call center contract ahead of an expected surge of calls from laid-off federal workers, despite concerns about the “Frankenstein-esque” growth of the contract.
The five-month extension, which was requested by the Maryland Department of Labor, comes one day after thousands of workers at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services learned they had been laid off. Many of those worked at HHS offices in Maryland, and are the latest in a wave of federal job cuts by the Trump administration that are hitting Maryland’s economy.
“This contract is designed to provide surge capacity to support Marylanders during this crisis,” Labor Secretary Portia Wu said at Wednesday’s board meeting. “We must be prepared to handle a massive increase in unemployment insurance claims.”
The state is already seeing a rise in unemployment claims, according to Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), who led the board meeting in place of Gov. Wes Moore (D).
HHS workers show up at Maryland offices Tuesday to find they were fired overnight

“Over the past 12 weeks, we’ve seen the reckless and devastating impacts of actions by the Trump administration — with the firings of tens of thousands of dedicated federal public servants, freezing billions of dollars in grants to our research institutions and dismantling the agencies that provide vital services for our state,” Miller said.
“This has impacted Maryland in a real and substantial way,” she said. “We’ve already begun to see an increase in unemployment insurance claims and anticipate that these figures will continue to … increase.”
Wu wants to extend a current call center services contract with the consulting firm, Accenture. The $3.9 million five-month extension would bring the total spent on the Accenture contract to $312.4 million since it was first awarded in April 2020. That first award was worth $19.6 million, state records show.
Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) said the contract has “ballooned” since the Hogan administration initially approved funds to pull in call center services in 2020 to help with the anticipated needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the contract has been extended several times.
“This contract was started in COVID,” Lierman said, noting that the Moore Administration was not in office yet, “and it has now ballooned to nearly 1,500% of where it was originally … it’s a little Frankenstein-esque.”
Wu agreed that the contract was costly for the state, which is why she said the department is attempting to wean itself off the Accenture contractors and recruit more state workers to staff the phone lines.
“Our goal is to ramp up the state staff,” Wu said. “We already have 100, we have the authority to bring on another 20,” Wu said. She reported that state workers handled 9,800 this week compared to Accenture’s 6,900 calls.
The contract extension will cover between 50-75 Accenture agents. The state pays about $55 per hour per agent to Accenture, which Wu admitted was an “expensive” and “costly contract” for the state.
State Treasurer Dereck E. Davis had a different interpretation.
“They’re screwing us, let’s not sugarcoat it,” he said, noting that $55 per hour equates to a $110,000 salary, though much of that money goes to the company as overhead and not directly to the worker answering the phone.
But the department still needs the Accenture agents given the rapid-fire layoffs at the federal level, according to Wu.
“We don’t know exactly what is coming our way in the next several months, but we do know that people will have a lot of questions and we want to be there to answer them,” she said.
Between state workers and Accenture agents, the department is handling close to 20,000 calls a week. Many of those calls are looking for “basic information,” such as forgetting a password or understanding how to file a claim. The contracted Accenture workers would answer those basic issues so that state Department of Labor workers would be freed up for more specialized and specific issues.
Despite the numerous questions, Lierman said the board was eager to support the contract extension.
“I wish we didn’t have to support our federal workforce in this way. It’s terrible, but I want us to make sure that we’re supporting our federal workers and that they get this timely information,” she said. “But I also don’t want us to use this federal-government-made disaster to raise taxpayer dollars. I think we understand the fiscal situation in the state, and so we have to make sure that we move on from contracts like this.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0030-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary's). (File photo by Bryan P. Sears)By the narrowest of margins Wednesday, the Senate voted to amend the Second Look Act, which gives long-term incarcerated individuals a second chance at life, to make it unavailable to those convicted of killing a first responder.
Eleven Senate Democrats joined all 13 Republicans to pass the amendment 24-23, before giving preliminary approval to the bill. The amendment means that if House Bill 853 wins final approval in the Senate it would have to go back to the House to accept or reject the change, with only five days left in this year’s legislative session.
The amendment by Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s) was the only one of three in the Senate that was successful. It said a person convicted of killing a first responder “in the line of duty” would not be eligible to petition the court for a reduced sentence under the Second Look Act. State law defines a first responder as a person such as a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or emergency medical technician.
“This amendment is meant to respect the job of our public safety officers, their families, to protect the victims, to protect the surviving family members, so that they never have to relive this tragedy that they had to go through,” Bailey said in the Senate Wednesday.
Sen. Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel), one of the Democrats who crossed the aisle to support Bailey’s amendment, said after the vote that a main reason she supported the amendment is because her father was a police officer.
Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored a Senate version of the bill and who served as the floor leader for the House version Wednesday, summarized parts of the legislation by noting a key factor: A judge would determine whether a person can receive a reduced sentence. It’s not a get-out-of-jail-free card, supporters insist.

Under the bill, some people who have served 20 or more years of a prison sentence could petition the court for a sentence reduction. According to the bill approved in the House more than two weeks ago, eligible individuals are those convicted of a crime between the ages of 18 and 25. Besides having to have served at least 20 years in prison, a personcannot have been sentenced without the possibility of parole and cannot be classified as a sex offender to be eligible
The court can assess several factors to determine whether someone incarcerated can have a reduced sentence. Those include the person’s age at the time of offense, if that person completed an educational, vocational, or other programs and “whether the individual has demonstrated maturity, rehabilitation, and fitness to reenter society sufficient to justify a sentence reduction.”
In addition, a victim or a victim’s representative may submit an impact statement to the court about the impact of a crime and proposed sentence reduction.
Prior to the House passing the bill, supporters stressed the fact that a judge will weigh the merits in each case, and that the law would only apply to about 350 people.
Sydnor also mentioned one other word during the nearly 50-minute debate Wednesday: grace.
“We all have grace, and this bill is about grace,” he said. “I would hope that at some point forgiveness would overcome me, and I certainly would not oppose a judge looking at these factors to determine whether or not that individual has made good on the 20 years that they were incarcerated.”
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick) also talked about grace when he introduced an amendment to make those convicted for killing a child under age 13 ineligible for the act.
“I believe in the idea of what my friend from Baltimore County says about grace, but that grace should come extended from those that lost a loved one, not an arbitrary element of adding an additional 18th look back,” said Folden, who added that only the loved ones should be allowed to petition the court.
His amendment was rejected 26-19.
Sen. Paul D. Corderman (R-Washington and Frederick) offered an amendment to make those convicted of killing a probation officer ineligible. Corderman mentioned Davis Martinez, a 33-year-old parole agent killed last year while checking in on a parolee.
“He was killed doing his job, serving our state,” Corderman said.
The Senate rejected his amendment 25-20.
The sponsor of the bill, Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County), said after the House adjourned Wednesday evening that she was a bit speechless on the amendment from her bill approved by the Senate earlier.
“I’m still trying to process it,” she said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0418-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Some have already started in an acting capacity, some have yet to get the keys to the new office, but they all gathered Wednesday on the second floor of the State House where Gov. Wes Moore (D) made it official, swearing in two new Cabinet-level secretaries and seven office leaders.
The nominees had to be confirmed by the Senate before they could be sworn in. The Cabinet secretaries got the full deal — one hand in the air and one on a Bible, before signing an official book. The others got their own handshake and photo op with the governor.
New Cabinet officials included Commerce Secretary Harry Coker Jr. and Dr. Meena Seshamani, the next secretary of Health who starts Tuesday.
Others included new Maryland Cannabis Administration Director Tabatha Robinson, Maryland Insurance Administrator Marie Grant, Correctional Ombudsman Yvonne Briley-Wilson, Katrina Wiggins as administrator of the Property Tax Assessment Appeals Boards and Shelly Martin as inspector general of Health.
Also sworn in was new Appointments Secretary Mollie Byron, who is taking over from Tisha Edwards, who was Wednesday’s ringleader, one of her last jobs in the office.
During the ceremony, Moore commended his administration’s newest officials for serving the state as it navigates “multiple storms at once.” Those “storms” include “a business model in the state of Maryland that needed updating” and “knowing that the relationship between the federal government and its states has been ruptured,” Moore said.
Moore got a laugh in his opening remarks when he said that Robinson, the new Maryland Cannabis Administration director, would “light up” Maryland.
“No pun intended,” Moore said with a laugh, apologizing to his communications staff. “That wasn’t even in my notes.”
Legislation creating new abortion grants to governor’s desk
Legislation to create new grants to fund abortion services, using untapped funds from insurance surcharges, has now won approval from both chambers and is well on its way to becoming Maryland law.
The Senate approved House Bill 930, sponsored by Del. Lesley Lopez (D-Montgomery), on a largely party-line 31-15 vote Wednesday. It was unchanged from the verion the House passed 98-37 in March, meaning the bill is now off to Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) desk, where he is expected to sign it given his history of support for reproductive rights.
HB930 would give the state Department of Health access to about $25 million in funds that were collected as part of the federal Affordable Care Act, but have not been spent down. The money comes from $1-a-month fee that insurers in the ACA marketplace are required to collect on every policy, to fund abortion services for their policyholders.
Before approving the legislation, Democratic senators shot down an amendment from Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) to restrict the use of those funds for Maryland residents only — an amendment he previously offered on the Senate version of the bill, which was rejected.
“This has nothing to do with the legality of abortion, the access to abortion for anyone in Maryland,” Ready said. “It just says we’re going to prioritize these Maryland ratepayer dollars for Maryland women.”
Sen. Dawn Gile (D-Anne Arundel), who led floor discussion on the bill, said that the uptick from out-of-state patients seeking abortion in the state was one of the leading reasons to support the legislation and those patients should not be cut out of the bill by Ready’s amendment.
“Our health care infrastructure here is under distress. We have lots of people here from out of state, it’s very important that individuals have access to these funds,” she said. “This is about basic access to health, using funds that are available, that are sitting in these accounts.”
The Senate version, Senate Bill 848, is identical and has already received both House and Senate approval, so it also awaits the Governor’s consideration.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC02662-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

Dolesh, who says it's worth fighting for the program and the parks, playgrounds and natural resources it's brought us.","Stock.adobe.com photo by Jim.Program Open Space has done an extraordinary job in conserving Maryland’s most valuable natural lands and providing funding for local recreational facilities, playgrounds and parks. However, in the history of Program Open Space and the land conservation and recreation programs funded under its umbrella, the funds have been diverted several times to fund critical state needs during times of budget crises.
Here’s how to be sure they don’t disappear forever in this budget crisis.
The revenues that fund POS and a host of other conservation and recreation projects are generated by a one-half of 1% transfer tax on the sale of homes. When the program began in 1969, it was thought that the funds would be sufficient to protect 10% of Maryland’s open spaces. Since then, the revenues have exceeded the wildest expectations of the governors, legislative leaders and agency staff who were the architects of the program.

Maryland has now protected 30% of its open space lands and has expanded the Program Open Space to include a host of other valuable preservation programs including the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation, the Rural Legacy program, capital maintenance of state park facilities and increased development of recreational facilities at the local level.
But the success of Program Open Space and its related conservation programs has made its funding source a fat target when lean times come around. This is not an unexpected outcome for special funds or state trust funds to be the first place that the executive and legislative branches look for relief when budget crises arise.
In the history of Program Open Space some or all the transfer tax revenues were diverted from 2002-2006 and again from 2009-2016, even in spite of legislation requiring the funds to be reimbursed.
Fast forward to the present day. The state is facing a structural deficit of more than $3 billion, and this does not take into consideration the yet-to-be-determined losses of state and local revenues from Trump administration cuts to budget and personnel. Maryland is particularly at risk because of the high proportion of federal workers who reside and work in the state.
What does this mean for the current budget and the future of land conservation in Maryland? There are a few lessons from history to guide present deliberations.

This isn’t the first time and it won’t be the last time that budget crises will make Program Open Space vulnerable. Yes, it is likely that the governor and legislature will take some or all the POS revenues. There needs to be strong, unified public pressure on the executive and legislative branches to restore the funding by a date-certain, and to renew the call for the restoration of funds each year.


In previous diversions of POS funding, a very vocal and effective coalition formed to focus on tracking the diversions and calling for restoration of funding. The present diversions should be a wake-up call to revitalize this very effective coalition. The strength of the original Partners for Open Space Coalition was in its diversity and unity.


A simple, unified message needs to resonate among advocates to the legislature and governor: Restore the funds! In previous diversions, the POS coalition was successful in gaining a promise to return full funding to Program Open Space


History has shown that annually taking all the POS revenues is a bad idea. In times of past diversions, unique opportunities to protect extremely valuable and important natural resource lands and waters, scenic resources and agricultural lands were lost because the state was unable to act in sufficient time to conserve the resource. The simple message here is: Don’t take all the funds each year.


Homebuyers, rural and urban communities, farmers and landowners will suffer a true loss when these funds are diverted. By taking these funds from their dedicated purpose, Marylanders will have fewer parks, fewer protected lands, less ability to adapt to climate change and sea level rise, and in effect, will pay a tax for a service that is never delivered to them or their communities.

These are lean times that we are entering, and we don’t know how mean they will be or how long they will last. We do know that Program Open Space has immeasurably enriched Maryland. History shows us that we can weather the storm and still sustain the best of what this conservation program has brought us by restoring it to full productivity when the crisis is over.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AdobeStock_265887583-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) In a swift and silent rebuke, the Virginia House of Delegates on Wednesday signed off on just 41 of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposed changes to the $188 billion state budget, rejecting the other 164 without floor debate.
Democrats fail to override Youngkin vetoes in largely symbolic showdown

The move leaves billions in spending and tax policy hanging in the balance — and sets the stage for a potential showdown between Democrats, a GOP governor and a Republican legislative minority three months before the new fiscal year begins. 
At the heart of the disagreement is Youngkin’s effort to slash $300 million from the budget to plug anticipated shortfalls linked to waning federal support. A major casualty of those proposed cuts is the funding to fully lift a long-standing cap on support for school staff — a key priority for public schools across the state. 
Lawmakers had approved $223 million for that initiative in February, but Youngkin wanted to pull back $183.2 million of it. The House said no. 
And although House Democrats supported locking in permanent increases to the standard tax deduction for filers who don’t itemize, along with an expanded refundable earned income tax credit for low-income Virginians, Senate Democrats pushed back, declining to make those changes permanent — despite including two-year boosts to both in the budget passed during the session. The proposal was one of eight additional amendments from Youngkin that failed in the Senate. 
Despite the tensions, the Democratic-controlled legislature did throw the governor a few wins, including a key concession for small businesses. Lawmakers agreed to continue the pass-through entity tax workaround, allowing business owners to bypass federal limits on state and local tax deductions. 
In his budget amendments that he unveiled at an event before administration officials and reporters in Richmond last month, Youngkin had already signed off on the legislature’s plan to issue nearly $1 billion in income tax rebates this fall — right before the upcoming statewide elections — with individuals set to receive $200 and joint-filers $400. He also accepted bonuses for public employees, a 1.5% bump for state workers and $1,000 payouts for teachers and school staff. 
Still, some of Youngkin’s more populist ideas never made it off the drawing board. During the legislative session, Democrats soundly rejected his proposals to offset car tax payments and exempt tip income from taxation, both modeled after GOP efforts on the national stage. 
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Youngkin acknowledged the formal conclusion of the 2025 legislative session with measured appreciation, even as Democrats rejected the vast majority of his proposed budget changes. 
“The General Assembly has now concluded its legislative work for 2025. I am grateful to all our legislators, who dedicate their time and energy to serving the people of Virginia,” Youngkin said.
Despite the pushback against a wide swath of his proposed amendments, the governor struck a conciliatory tone and emphasized the next phase of the process. 
“Over the next 30 days I will review and take final action on the bills and budget amendments that have been sent back to my desk,” he said, signaling that more vetoes could still be on the horizon.
Beginning with lunch in the afternoon, Virginia lawmakers ended Wednesday’s lengthy reconvened session agreeing on several amendments made by Youngkin, moving forward proposals to improve traffic stops in the commonwealth, expand opportunities for people who have been incarcerated and reign in risky drivers.
However, on the same day, lawmakers also rejected Youngkin’s amendments for bills that would have made changes to textbook and instructional materials in public schools, preserved Virginians’ access to contraceptives and required unconscious bias training when renewing medical licenses.
Here are some of the bills taken up during Wednesday’s reconvened session.
 Probation reform advances

Following an unlikely alliance between the two parties, Virginia is now a step closer to probation reform that advocates stress can help citizens returning to their communities after incarceration get back on their feet and be less likely to reoffend. 
After passing both chambers last month, Virginia’s legislature formally accepted the governor’s amendments to SB 936 and HB 2252. Youngkin vetoed a version of the bill last year before embracing it this year, albeit with his own changes tacked on.
Unlikely allies unite for probation reform, but Youngkin has final say

Both bills aim to allow reduced probation times if formerly incarcerated people demonstrate certain milestones indicative of reestablishing their lives. Examples include securing employment for at least 30 hours a week, earning vocational certifications, participating in mental health or substance use treatment programs and obtaining stable housing and health insurance coverage. 
While the passed version of the bill allows for up to 30-days reduction in probation time depending on criteria met and 15 days for others, Youngkin’s amendment places them all at 15 days. Advocates in support of the bill note that it can build on an executive order Youngkin signed last summer designed to reduce recidivism. 
With his amendments accepted, he’s likely to sign the bill. 
 Right-to-contraception amendment nixed 

As happened last year, the legislature passed a right-to-contraception bill that Youngkin sought amendments on before later vetoing. Both chambers rejected the governor’s recommended changes to the measure.
Youngkin’s substitute of the bill reinforces two U.S. Supreme Court cases that deal with access to contraception nationwide, while the proposal would preserve contraception access specifically in Virginia, if those federal cases should be overturned. Some states have debated contraceptive restrictions after the rollback of federal protections for abortion in 2022.
Before requesting the Senate reject his amendments Wednesday, bill sponsor Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, said Youngkin’s amendment “makes this bill not really worth anything at all.” 
When lawmakers rejected his amendment last year he’d vetoed the bill — something that is likely to reoccur this year. 
 Unconscious bias amendments rejected

Also on the reproductive health front, the legislature rejected Youngkin’s amendments to a bill that would require unconscious bias training when renewing medical licenses. Carried several years in a row with bipartisan support and patronage, Youngkin sought similar amendments last year that were rejected before he ultimately vetoed it.
His substitute strips the mention of cultural competency and unconscious bias, and instead added “populations that data indicate experience significantly greater than average maternal mortality, postpartum complications and infant mortality.”
Youngkin signs several maternal health bills, tweaks another on unconscious bias training

The proposal, found in SB 740 and identical House measure HB 1649, was part of a slate of bills aimed at improving maternal health outcomes this year, in light of data showing Black women are more likely to have negative outcomes or die than others. Studies show that racial bias can be a factor in the disparities. 
With his changes not accepted, he could veto the bill again. 
 Establishing a sole Pharmacy Benefit Manager for Virginia

The legislature voted to reject Youngkin’s amendments to SB 875 and HB 2610, which would establish a sole pharmacy benefits manager in Virginia. 
Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies, but their lack of transparency has raised concerns. PBMs retain rebates and discounts from contracts, leaving consumers and pharmacies unsure how much savings are actually being passed on. 
After the proposals cleared the Senate unanimously and nearly so in the House, Youngkin’s amendment sought to study the matter further. 
“We do not need more studies,” Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, one of the bill’s patrons, said Wednesday. “This is a true bipartisan bill.” 
He and Republican lawmakers have teamed up to tout what they called the “Save Local Pharmacies Act.” The bill would eliminate health-plan-run PBMs in Medicaid and establish a single state-contracted one. This move, supporters say, would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat. 
 Exhibition driving bill speeds ahead

The House agreed to the governor’s recommendation targeting exhibition driving that would bring tougher penalties for offenders. 
The bill, carried by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, broadens Virginia’s reckless driving laws to include exhibition driving, defined as aggressive driving near groups of two or more people. Offenders would also face stiffer penalties including up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine — either or both — under the proposal.
Passengers of exhibition drivers wouldn’t get off scott-free, either. If they’re caught riding on a car’s hood or roof, they would face a $500 fine, the measure dictates.
One of the amendment changes removes the mandatory minimum jail term if an offender causes the death of another person. The penalty for the felony offense is a minimum of one year and a maximum of 20 years in jail.
 Driver-police communication improvements pending

The House accepted a recommendation by the governor for a bill carried by Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, that would improve communication between drivers who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and law enforcement officers. 
HB 2501 charges the Department of Motor Vehicles with designing a program that would oversee the development of special envelopes identifying drivers with autism, which those drivers could show police during traffic stops to help the interaction proceed smoothly. 
The governor’s recommendation added language that the DMV does not have to verify any information on the envelope.
According to the Department of Planning and Budget, it would cost about $14,500 for DMV to implement the proposal.
 Amendment to textbook, instructional materials bill rejected

Lawmakers in both chambers rejected the governor’s amendment for a bill that would have made changes to textbooks and other instructional materials in Virginia’s public schools.
Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who carried the bill in the Senate, opposed the governor’s amendment because it excluded in part language to create a work group to study the textbook approval processes.
The amendment also excluded language that would require the Virginia Department of Education to consult with teachers, specialists and subject experts to evaluate any changes to the current textbook review process.
The companion bill, carried by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, was also rejected in the House.
 License plate reader regulation tweak blocked

An effort to regulate automated license plate readers at the state level was met with debate and near-defeat throughout the 2025 legislative session, after the proposal had also been workshopped last year by the Virginia Crime Commission. After passing the legislature, Youngkin’s amendments to HB 2724 were rejected Wednesday. 
The technology has become widely adopted by law enforcement, private businesses and homeowner associations across the country but has also largely operated in a grey area. Virginia’s police departments that use it have not been subject to regulation — though some departments, such as  Charlottesville’s, have already self-regulated, with moves like capping data storage to seven days.
In attempting to regulate at the state level, House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, sought to limit data storage to 30 days, but opposition from criminal justice and immigrants rights groups compelled her to reduce that to 21 days. 
Youngkin’s amendment would have bumped that back up to 30 days. With the rejection, he can now choose to sign the bill as it had come to him or he can veto it.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)As Ohio legislators were working to finish the House’s draft of the state operating budget for the next two years, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce held its Childcare Policy Summit across the street with advocates and business leaders stressing the importance of child care to workers and business.
“We can’t just warehouse kids, we can’t just provide custodial child care to kids,” said David Smith, executive director of Horizon Education Centers.
The chamber held the summit for the second time in two years as it leans in to the issue. Its senior vice president of government affairs, Rick Carfagna, said it is “the largest workforce throttle that we have at the moment.”
“We have an entire demographic of Ohioans that are skilled, they are college educated, they are creative, they are hard-working people, men and women alike, and they are simply not looking for work at all,” Carfagna told the Capital Journal.
Before the summit even began, he spoke to lawmakers in the House Children and Human Services Committee, supporting bills to address the cost of child care and the building up of the child care workforce.
The House budget proposals
Language from the bills the committee was considering when Carfagna met with them now appear in the House’s version of the state budget. House Bill 2 aimed to establish the “Child Care Cred Program,” to split the cost of child care three ways: funding from the state, a share from employers, and the rest from employees who are eligible for the child care.
Another part of the new draft budget is a Child Care Recruitment and Mentorship Grant Program to help “increase the number of licensed child care providers in Ohio and assist recruited entities and individuals,” according to the budget language released this week. It contains a $3.2 million appropriation in fiscal year 2026 for “child care provider recruitment.”

Smith was part of a panel discussion about the “workforce behind the workforce,” child care workers who take care of children so their parents can go to school or maintain their place in the workforce.
Meanwhile, Ohioans have been having trouble staying in the workforce because of the lack of affordable child care and lack of access to any child care at all in some regions of the state.
Advocates in and out of Tuesday’s summit have said raising the eligibility level for Publicly Funded Child Care and reimbursement rates for child care workers should be top of mind for lawmakers if they want to help the situation.
In the Ohio House’s version of the budget, the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility remained at the current level of 145% of the federal poverty line, rather than the governor’s proposal — and the one child care advocates hoped for — of 200%. In Ohio, the federal poverty level for a family of four is $32,150 a year.
Carfagna said the chamber hoped the federal poverty level would be increased, but “that alone isn’t good enough.”
As a former a lawmaker who’s gone through the budget process, Carfagna said he understands there are numerous priorities being dealt with in the budget, and that legislators have to weigh them.
“There are a lot of big price-tag issues that all just kind of hit you from different corners, so legislators, probably rightfully so, need to be careful to not overpromise,” he said.
One big item that has been widely supported by child advocates all over the state was a proposal by Gov. Mike DeWine in his executive budget to create a refundable income tax credit of up to $1,000 for Ohio children up to age 6. That provision did not make it to the House draft.
The Child Care Voucher Program, a previously existing program that subsidizes some children’s admission into qualified child care centers, did have its eligibility brought to 200% of the federal poverty line in the House budget draft.
According to the budget document, however, the voucher program would have a budget of $50 million for each year of the biennium, rather than the previous proposal of $75 million in fiscal year 2026, and $150 million in 2027.
 Workforce help
In addition to a lack of affordability and access is a problem in which the staffing needed to take care of young children is just not there, advocates said.
Tami Lunan, organizing director for the Ohio-based CEO Project who was not part of the summit but has been testifying in favor of child care measures at the Statehouse as part of the the budget process. She said new money for the child care sector should go directly to providers.
“We want to see something transformational, and I think looking to our workforce is a big part of that,” Lunan said.
Lunan said the industry already has low wages and high turnover, and continuing to underfund the staff maintains the narrative that the workforce is not as important as in other professions.
“I think that’s by design that we’re not investing in it,” Lunan said. “Because we don’t see those businesses as viable, we don’t see those workers as professionals. They look to them more as babysitters.”
According to a 2024 analysis by Policy Matters Ohio, Black Ohioans are more likely to be child care workers, making up 18.8% of the industry’s workforce, despite only making up 12.5% of the state population that year.
The Ohio legislature has heard testimony from several child care workers, advocates, and the Ohio Chamber of Commerce about the need to incentivize work in the child care sector, and improve pay and benefits for those workers.
Traditional business solutions won’t work for child care providers, said Chris Angellatta, CEO of the Ohio Child Care Resource & Referral Association.
“We have challenges that are very different,” Angellatta said. “We can’t just compete in the labor market and continue to pay people more and just expect families to continue to pay more. It’s already expensive.”
To help care providers, the House budget draft has a provision to calculate Publicly Funded Child Care based on a child’s enrollment with a provider, rather than basing it on the child’s attendance. That’s something Angellatta said would be “critical” for both families and providers.
“We all know that just because someone is not in attendance doesn’t mean that spot isn’t saved for them,” he said.
An Early Childhood Education Grant Program to “invest in Ohio’s early learning and development programs” including licensed child care centers, licensed family child care homes, and licensed preschools is included in the House budget draft as well. Eligibility goes up to 200% of the federal poverty line.
Discussions about child care in Ohio come down to one primary theme: It can’t be fixed by one bill or one source of funding. Instead, the state and everyone involved in decision making have to implement multi-step strategies to improve the start of children’s education and the building of a new workforce.
“If you really want to do this, you have to do it in a three-dimensional manner,” Carfagna said. “You have to attack it from the eligibility standpoint, the capacity side of it, and we need people to staff our child care centers.”
For Lunan, the problem can be looked at very simply by those who hold the state’s funding decisions in their hands.
“We literally can not have a thriving economy without child care,” she said.
The House budget will now move to the Ohio Senate, which will draft its own budget. The two drafts will need to be reconciled before the end of June, when a budget must be sent to DeWine for his signature.

As North Carolina’s top lawyer, Attorney General Jeff Jackson has many important jobs — handling important criminal prosecutions, protecting consumers, representing state agencies in litigation. But if there’s a duty that is clearly his Number One priority, it has to be defending North Carolinians from unlawful attacks on their rights and well-being.
And it’s in light of this obvious fact that Jackson should be commended for his recent action challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful scheme to cancel billions of dollars in Health and Human Services grants already allocated by Congress.
In bringing suit along with 21 other attorneys general, Jackson rightfully blasted the move by Trump and his right-hand man Elon Musk to slash more than $230 million in critical health care funding for North Carolina as both unlawful and dangerous.
The bottom line: In standing up for our state, Attorney General Jackson is doing precisely what voters elected him to do. Trump apologists in the legislature who are currently seeking to prevent Jackson from challenging presidential orders, are dead wrong.

Jeremiah Moore (right), R-Clarendon, present House Bill 1150 to the House Committee on Insurance and Commerce on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)A House panel Wednesday approved a bill aimed at preventing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas.
Opponents outnumbered supporters in the public comment period of the House Insurance and Commerce Committee meeting, but a majority of the panel’s 21 members voted to send House Bill 1150 to the full House.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and they rank prescription drugs with the highest-tiered products costing consumers the lowest out-of-pocket costs. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.
“Pharmacy benefit managers are gaming the system to line their own pockets with taxpayers’ and patients’ money,” said HB 1150 sponsor Rep. Jeremiah Moore, R-Clarendon.
He decried the “patently false” statements circulating about the potential impact of HB 1150 from those who oppose it, such as the idea that 2.7 million Arkansans would lose access to health care. HB 1150 has faced a marketing campaign against it in the two and a half months since it was filed, and Moore said the opposition has primarily come from PBMs.
Arkansas lawmakers seek to ban prescription drug middlemen from owning pharmacies in the state

Some of Wednesday’s opponents of HB 1150 represented corporate health care organizations, including Russell Harper, a government relations executive with the Navitus Health Solutions PBM.
Harper said the bill “will result in lots of unintended consequences that will bring patient disruption, patient confusion and patient access issues to important drug treatments, not just in the commercial market, but in Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare.”
He claimed a wide swath of Arkansas pharmacies, including 23 within CVS and 26 within Kroger, would be at risk of closing if HB 1150 passes.
John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association, denied the allegation that HB 1150 would force pharmacies to close by taking PBMs out of the competitive pharmacy market.
“It gives pharmacies a choice of whether they want to be a PBM or a pharmacy,” Vinson said. “[They would] pick one or the other.”
 Debate

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding. Vinson said Wednesday that some PBMs force consumers to receive their medications via mail, which costs more than receiving them over the counter.
Mike Castleberry claimed HB 1150 would reduce mail-order pharmacies’ presence in Arkansas to the point that patients would not be able to access necessary medication. Castleberry is chief revenue officer at Consociate Health, which represents “self-funded employers” in Arkansas, and he said many pharmacies can only afford to provide specialty drugs if they use mail-order operations.
“The first phone call that y’all are going to get from your constituents [if HB 1150 passes] is someone who’s on a specialty drug,” he said.
Randy Zook, president of the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, said lawmakers should not make laws that attack vertical integration in business, but Vinson and Moore both said PBMs’ vertical integration is unique because they set their competitors’ prices.

Federal regulator: Pharmacy middlemen appear to be raising prices, hurting patients


OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — the three largest PBMs — are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.
CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health, and District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis expressed opposition to HB 1150 on Wednesday. Ellis said pharmacists that work for PBM-owned and corporate pharmacies are still members of their local communities, and they have access to the medications and equipment that serve people with complex health needs while independent pharmacies do not necessarily have these things.
Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, said he received several emails from constituents who ostensibly opposed HB 1150 but said they “knew nothing about this” when he contacted them. He alleged that the emails came from lobbyists against HB 1150 who received his constituents’ personal information from CVS, where they told him they receive prescription drugs.
McGrew questioned Ellis about this “breach of integrity,” and Ellis said she was not aware of this.
 Past legislative action

Navitus Chief Pharmacy Officer Sharon Faust said Arkansas has been “a frontrunner” on regulating prescription drug access and prices, but HB 1150 would be “a step too far, a step further where you’re actually limiting patient choice [and] reducing competition.”
Vinson and Moore said PBMs routinely reimburse their affiliate pharmacies at a higher rate than their competitors, locally-owned independent pharmacies.
This practice is outlawed in Arkansas by Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018, which became law after a special legislative session. Arkansas lawmakers have been attempting to regulate PBMs for the past decade, starting with Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs.
Pharmacy benefit managers will have to pay Arkansas drugstores dispensing fees under new rule

Despite this, pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) roughly 3,000 complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year. Independent pharmacists made similar claims in September, saying they were struggling to stay open in rural areas with limited healthcare resources.
The Arkansas Legislative Council approved a rule in December to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs.
Removing PBM-affiliated pharmacies from the market would require the employee benefits division of the Arkansas government “to reevaluate and restructure their pharmacy networks and implement new compliance measures,” according to an actuarial statement measuring the fiscal impact of HB 1150.
“There could be minor cost or saving[s] to the plan from excluding certain retail pharmacies from their network, such as CVS Caremark,” according to the statement. “Such a change would require a significant number of EBD members to transfer their prescriptions to an in-network pharmacy and may reduce pharmacy network access.”

(Getty Images)During a busy two days of voting last week, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved several Republican-backed bills seeking to lift or prevent certain public health-centered requirements for children.
Two of these bills target childhood vaccination requirements. The first, House Bill 357, was passed by the House on March 27 in a 195-174 vote.
The bill would forbid the state’s commissioner of health and human services from choosing which vaccines children in New Hampshire are required to receive. All mandatory vaccines would have to be chosen and enacted by the Legislature under this bill. If it were to pass — and the Legislature doesn’t enact further legislation requiring them — varicella, Hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccines would stop being mandatory among children in July 2026. Diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, poliomyelitis, rubella, rubeola, and tetanus vaccines would remain mandatory as they are required by state statute, not the commissioner.
The Legislature previously gave the commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to choose what vaccines are mandatory for children in addition to the ones already mandatory by state statute. Lori Weaver is the current health commissioner. Children can be exempted from these requirements if a physician certifies that the vaccine would be detrimental to their health or if the parents say it goes against their religion, per state law. That would not change under this bill.
Speaking in favor of the bill on the House floor, Rep. Matt Drew, a Manchester Republican, argued the legislation “is not actually about vaccines.”
“This bill is about the exercise of state power, specifically the power to violate the bodily autonomy of innocent children,” Drew said. “We may choose to do that. This body has the power to do that given a good reason. … But it is not something that should be done lightly.”
He argued the Legislature should not let the Department of Health and Human Services decide when to do that.
“This is our job,” he said. “We should do it publicly and by statute.”
Only one Democrat — Rep. Jonah Wheeler of Peterborough — voted in favor of the bill.
Rep. Lucy Weber, a Walpole Democrat, argued this bill would “remove decision-making from a nonpartisan evidence-based process led by doctors, epidemiologists, infectious disease experts as it has been done for decades and hand it over to the state Legislature to be a political football.”
HB 357 will now be considered by the Senate. The Senate Health and Human Services Committee is expected to hold a hearing on it soon. The full Senate and governor will also need to approve the bill for it to be enacted.
House Bill 679, which was also passed last week, seeks to bar the state and health and human services commissioner from requiring any vaccine for children that has not been shown in clinical trials to prevent transmission of a disease. It was approved through Republican support (Wheeler was again the only Democrat voting in favor) in a 204-165 vote.
Rep. Trinidad Tellez, a Hooksett Democrat, argued that even when a vaccine doesn’t directly prevent transmission, if it prevents someone from getting the illness in the first place, it prevents that person from transmitting it.
“Vaccines are most effective when most of us get vaccinated because collectively that provides herd immunity,” Tellez said. “When most people are vaccinated there is less of that illness in the community, and as a result, there is decreased transmission.”
She said the bill “isn’t based on science and introduces an impossible standard.”
“Vaccines are not created nor tested to prevent transmission,” she continued. “Rather they decrease disease severity and how much we see of it.”
She said the bill will likely eliminate mandates for most vaccines as she believes pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to go back and test for transmission.
Drew, the Manchester Republican, was again in favor of this bill.
“Once again, this bill is not about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines,” Drew said. “This bill is about whether the state should mandate — force — children to get certain vaccines.”
HB 679 is also on its way to the Senate, and the Health and Human Services Committee is set to hold a hearing on it. The bill will need the full Senate and governor’s approval to be enacted.
House Bill 361, which was passed in a 203-164 vote last week, would forbid public schools in the state from requiring students to wear masks in school. The bill does not apply to safety equipment worn in sports or during science lab activities.
The bill comes in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic where many schools instituted mask mandates in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Those mandates saw intense backlash from parents who believed this was government overreach, that masks weren’t effective, and that they had adverse effects on kids. However, the issue proved contentious as other parents were concerned about the risk of their child contracting the virus and thus wanted their classmates wearing masks.
Rep. Kristen Noble, a Bedford Republican, argued these masks negatively impacted students’ learning, speech, physical health, emotional well-being, and social development. She also said that students who can’t wear masks because of their disabilities need to be protected from future mask mandates. 
“We cannot let this be a local decision,” Noble said. “A proper risk-benefit analysis for children must be done based on facts and not fear. That is a task that should be left to experts at the state. School boards were in the middle of two very vocal opinions on masking. No matter what the school boards decide, they lose. They should never have that responsibility placed on them again.”
She said the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Public Health wrote in a letter recently that “decisions on face masks should be based on individual choice and informed by a person’s own assessment and acceptance of risk from infectious diseases rather than from universal requirements.”
She pointed out that the bill doesn’t stop anyone from wearing a mask, including those who are immunocompromised or who want additional protection due to a family member being sick or immunocompromised.
However, the bill does stop schools from requiring others to wear a mask to protect those people. 
This bill was also passed against the wishes of most House Democrats, who argued the bill doesn’t take into account the changing nature of medical and scientific understanding and takes away the freedom of school districts to respond to health situations in their district. Two hundred of the bill’s 203 votes in favor came from Republicans; two Republicans voted against it.
Rep. Hope Damon, a Croydon Democrat, asked her colleagues ahead of the vote to “please pause for a moment” and “step back from the understandably strong emotions around our shared concerns around pandemic experiences and the impacts of masking during that time.”
She argued school districts should have the flexibility to require masks if extreme circumstances occur in their local community.
“Imagine that you are an 8-year-old second-grade student, Lydia,” Damon said. “You’ve had surgery to remove a brain tumor and are now undergoing chemotherapy. As many of us personally know, chemo saves lives, but also has profound effects. Most commonly, it greatly reduces immunity, which makes our little girl very vulnerable to any contagious illness. Lydia, who has always thrived in school, has not been able to attend for over a month. Now, her oncologist has authorized her return to school with the qualification that she and her classmates routinely wear masks to protect her from what would likely be a fatal illness. Lydia is elated, yet under HB 361, Lydia would not be able to return to school because the school district could not require her fellow students to mask.”
HB 361 will also be considered by the Senate with the Senate Education Committee set to hold a hearing on it soon. It also needs the full Senate and governor’s approval to become law.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/maskingnhbill-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 05:01:54.961038

(Jason Kempin/Getty Images)The nation’s historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, are wondering how to survive in an uncertain and contentious educational climate as the Trump administration downsizes the scope and purpose of the U.S. Department of Education — while cutting away at federal funding for higher education.
In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.










There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.

Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
‘None of them are equitable’
In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”
Tribes, Native students sue feds over education cuts

Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
Economic anchors
There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.
Why Alabama can’t control college tuition costs

Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”
US Education Department threatens yanking funds for schools that use race in decisions

For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

Negotiators from both chambers are optimistic they’ll have a finished product soon. But with the House finalizing its version of the two-year operating budget, lawmakers’ attention could be spread thin.
Where the bills align and differ

The core of both proposals is the same — encourage new companies to build power plants with a mix of tax incentives and market protections to maintain a level playing field. Most notable, the bills prohibit monopoly utilities from participating in the energy generation marketplace.
Both bills push utilities to open their books through the traditional ratemaking process instead of nickel-and-diming customers with repeated surcharges. Among those, lawmakers voted to repeal a subsidy for aging coal plants that was approved as part of 2019’s House Bill 6. That rider has already cost Ohio ratepayers more than $455 million.
In exchange for those changes, utilities will see much faster regulatory decisions and a three-year rate setting horizon.
Still, there are differences remaining between the House and Senate bills. The Senate’s tax breaks are more generous than those offered by the House. Both bills also come with secondary programs. The House proposes a pilot program for communities to chip in on small scale power generation to defray their bills. The Senate offers a plan to loan schools money for rooftop solar.
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis, whose office advocates on behalf of ratepayers, has been mostly supportive of the changes. Willis argued eliminating utility bill riders and repealing the coal plant bailout are major positives.
Ohio House committee tees up its own energy plan after Senate approves overhaul

She also praised a provision in the House bill giving state regulators a formal role in reviewing transmission projects. Under current law, those improvements aren’t evaluated for “reasonableness or prudence.” Critics argue it’s a backdoor to bill customers for costly or unnecessary projects. Willis’ office has filed a complaint with federal regulators criticizing the lack of oversight.
Willis continued to voice concerns about the idea of setting rates on a three-year basis. The figures are supposed to get “trued-up” annually — as in, adjusted to meet reality. But she warns utilities will do their best to ensure rates only ever go up, and lawmakers need to make sure adjustments go up and down.
Still, she said, “We are encouraged by the energy legislation proposed by both chambers of the General Assembly.”
“These efforts set Ohio on a path toward meaningful regulatory reform,” Willis added. “We look forward to continuing our discussions on these important issues with members.”
Reasons for optimism
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman downplayed negotiations. “There are very small differences,” he said, and voiced little concern about juggling the energy and budget bills at once.
“We could have that,” Huffman allowed. “You know, it’s passed overwhelmingly in both houses, so that wouldn’t take up a lot of time at a session next week, so it could happen.”
State Rep. Adam Holmes, R-Nashport, who heads up the House Energy Committee, was also quick to accentuate the positives.
“We’re so closely aligned,” he said, “I don’t even know if there’s disagreements, just differences — things they inserted and things that we didn’t. So, we’re just going to try to streamline that (Thursday) and then start running with the bill.”
In the Senate, leaders sang from the same hymnal.
“I wouldn’t say there’s a lot of (differences),” the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Bill Reineke, R-Tiffin explained, “but there are some. We’ll continue to work on those and hopefully have some kind of a resolution soon.”
Senate President Rob McColley predicted negotiations would play out “over the next week or two.”
“Maybe by the end of the month, maybe beginning of May, we’ll have some sort of final vote on it,” he added. “Maybe even sooner, if we can find a solution quicker.”
Settling differences
Holmes said he’s keeping an open mind about tax rates. While the Senate eliminates tangible personal property taxes on new power facilities, the House reduced the rate from 25% to 7%.
“I think the 7%, we’re concerned about ensuring that communities that have new generation are equipped to support it correctly with that tax money,” Holmes explained.
Holmes added that he wants to go back over some of the late additions to the bill.
“There are concepts in there that haven’t been vetted as well,” he said. “We’re gonna sit down and do that again — the whole multi-year rate plan — like make sure we have all the controls.”
Reineke doesn’t see any of the disagreements between proposals as “make or break,” but said he doesn’t know yet whether it’s more likely differences stay in or get stripped out. Either way, Reineke doesn’t believe the budget process will be a distraction for energy bill negotiations.
“I think that this is kind of just a conclusion for a lot of work that’s already been done,” he said. “I guess I would look at it the opposite (way). We need to finalize it now while it’s all fresh in our mind and (we) know what the key points are.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The Federal Trade Commission late Tuesday stayed a lawsuit accusing pharmacy middlemen of gaming the system to inflate the price of insulin — a drug millions of Americans need to survive. When it did, it left experts in Ohio and elsewhere trying to figure out if President Donald Trump was trying to sabotage the commission’s work, or if it was simply part of his vendetta against Democrats.
Created in 1914, the FTC is tasked with stopping unfair trade practices — particularly those by big corporations that use their dominance to harm small businesses and consumers. 
Starting around 1980, Republican and then Democratic administrations — which appoint the agency’s commissioners — greatly diminished the role of the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. The argument then prevailed that despite what the laws themselves said, the goal of antitrust law was efficiency, which would supposedly deliver better outcomes for consumers.
But awareness has grown in recent years that the rise of big box stores, health conglomerates, and tech companies hasn’t been to the uniform benefit of consumers. 
In response, the Biden administration began a new era of stepped-up enforcement of laws that had long been on the books. The FTC filed lawsuits against Amazon, to stop the Kroger-Albertson’s merger, and it sued giant health conglomerates. It accused the latter companies of unfairly driving up insulin prices at the expense of diabetics — especially those with low incomes.
That was the case that the FTC stayed on Monday.
The agency did so because two Republican commissioners had recused themselves from the case, saying they had conflicts of interest. A third Republican commissioner hasn’t yet been approved by the Senate. And Trump in March tried to fire the two Democratic appointees, Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter.
The case was to be heard by the commissioners. But now there aren’t any to hear it.

Bedoya and Slaughter are in court challenging the attempted firings, arguing that the president doesn’t have the power to simply decree a change in the structure of a regulatory commission created by Congress. The suit quotes the Federal Trade Commission Act, which says the president can only remove commissioners “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”
So long as that lawsuit plays out, the FTC suit against the pharmacy middlemen won’t. 
It alleges that the big three pharmacy middlemen excluded cheaper generic forms of insulin from insurance coverage in order to extract larger rebates from manufacturers’ more costly products.
The three biggest middlemen, or pharmacy benefit managers, control nearly 80% of the insured drug transactions in the United Sates. Each is a part of a conglomerate that also owns a major insurer — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts. 
As middlemen, the benefit managers decide which drugs are covered, and which of those have low or no copayments. The FTC suit says that since 2012, they’ve been increasingly aggressive about demanding ever-larger, non-transparent rebates — their critics call them kickbacks — from manufacturers in exchange for covering their drugs. 
With insulin, prices were effectively jacked up when the middlemen refused to cover some of the cheapest alternatives at all, the suit said. 
It’s clear that for now, anyway, the insulin suit isn’t going anywhere. What isn’t clear is whether that’s what Trump intended when he tried to remove Bedoya and Slaughter.
“Sadly, this was an entirely foreseeable consequence of illegally attempting to fire the minority commissioners,” they said in a joint statement Tuesday decrying the suspension of the insulin suit.
Foreseeable, yes, but was it intentional? The White House press office didn’t respond to questions Wednesday.
On the one hand, Trump in the past has been critical of the pharmacy middlemen. In his first administration, he floated the idea of ending legal exemptions that allow them to collect rebates from manufacturers in exchange for covering their drugs. And in December, then President-elect Trump said of pharmacy benefit managers, “The horrible middleman that makes more money, frankly, than the drug companies, and they don’t do anything except they’re a middleman,” USA Today reported. “I don’t know who these middlemen are, but they are rich.”
Despite all that, Trump hasn’t taken any meaningful action against the health conglomerates that own the middlemen — or against tech moguls such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, who donated millions to his campaign and his inauguration. Meanwhile, Trump has at least temporarily crippled the antitrust watchdog that has tried to rein them in.
Antonio Ciaccia is a Columbus-based drug-pricing expert who has followed the rise of drug middlemen since Trump’s first term. He said the president is yet to back up his tough talk with concrete action.
“In his first term as president, Trump pushed to eliminate the anti-kickback law exemptions that ballooned the prices of medicines like insulin. The Biden Administration refused to implement the policy,” Ciaccia said. “The FTC’s lawsuit against (pharmacy benefit managers) over their role in inflating the prices of insulin was another opportunity to achieve Trump’s original policy goals albeit via different means. Regardless of the intent, the recent shake-up at the FTC effectively ends that pursuit for the foreseeable future.”

The bills keep coming, one after another, after another.
Ohio Republicans are dominating the “culture wars” over schools and students, joining other states in passing a barrage of new laws involving race, ethnicity and gender with several more in the pipeline.
Both emboldened by President Donald Trump’s success in the 2024 elections and as a backlash against former President Joe Biden, bills pressing the Make America Great agenda in schools have accelerated and come in rapid fire.
In the past year, Ohio’s Republican supermajority has defended in court its 2023 bans of transgender athletes participating in school sports and of “gender-affirming” health care including hormone treatments and blockers for minors.
Since Trump’s November victory, the state has also passed or is still pursuing far right bills including a transgender bathroom ban and a parental bill of rights opposed by the LGBTQ community, while also opening the door for religious study by public school students and attacking “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)” efforts in both colleges and K-12 schools.
Ohio transgender bathroom ban bill heads to Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk

The bill affecting colleges, which also includes restrictions on teaching “controversial beliefs,” drew strong opposition but was signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine last week.
Ohio, the state with the sixth most students, is one of several passing similar bills — but the number and speed of them reflects the state’s shift to the right in recent years. Ohio was once one of the most reliable bellwether states in presidential elections, voting for the national winner in 14 straight elections from 1964 to 2020. But Ohio voted for Trump in 2020 when he lost, and has now backed him in three state elections, and the state is drawing some national attention for what some consider extremism on education and other issues such as abortion.
Troy McIntosh, executive director of education efforts for the Center for Christian Virtues, an Ohio nonprofit whose influence on legislators has grown in recent years, said Trump’s November win and the wave of bills are fueled by parent anger over how some social issues were framed and taught in online classes during the pandemic. It’s also a pushback against Biden giving transgender students more rights in ways some parents feel infringe on their own.
“Part of the message the electorate sent in that election is, ‘look, we need to fix this,’” McIntosh said. “This is not something we support – these progressive, radical in many ways, interpretations of law,  of culture, ethics. So, sure, the (Ohio) General Assembly is responding to what the electorate told them they wanted.”
Democrats, whose opposition to the Trump-aligned bills is regularly outvoted by the state’s Republican supermajority, said the bills distract from more pressing issues like school funding and improving learning, while also being destructive.
“Some of it is just the politics of fear,” said State Senator Kent Smith, a Democrat from the Cleveland area. “It’s a racist agenda, not the ‘out of many, we become one,’ which the country was founded on.”
Bills like those passing in Ohio have cropped up in several states.Texas and Florida have led the way, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation, with other states like Indiana, Oklahoma and Kentucky each passing or proposing different combinations of bills, some directly focused on schools and others lumping schools in with all public services. Ohio was the 23rd state, for example, to pass some form of a parental bill of rights.

Many have centered on rights of transgender youth, which flared into national controversy when the Biden administration made gender identity, not just biological sex, a protected class under Title IX, a 1972 law against sexual discrimination in education. That led to debates over schools allowing transgender youth to use bathrooms they choose and over transgender students participating on sports teams, usually male students transitioning to female.
“We’ve seen really a host of state prohibitions, either through executive order or by legislation, related to gender,” said Jonathan Butcher, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “Ohio is in the midst of it.”
Trump is leading the charge to undo Biden’s guidance, most notably with orders in January declaring that there are just two sexes — male and female — and that only biological sex, not gender identity, counts in federal law. But Butcher said states need to take action, particularly with no federal laws in place to carry Trump’s plan out.
“Executive orders are, of course, valuable and strong, but legislation is stronger,” he said. “You need provisions right in law in order for these things to not just take effect, but also remain in effect.”
Butcher said he isn’t as surprised as some at how much legislatures like Ohio’s have acted the last few years, saying it’s typical for changes and tempers to flare when emotional topics are debated, though he sympathizes with feelings of “whiplash” as the nation goes through it.
Ohio’s shift to the right didn’t start with these bills or Trump’s election. Vice President J.D. Vance was elected to the U.S. Senate for Ohio in 2022 and Republican Bernie Moreno just knocked off Democrat Sherrod Brown for Ohio’s other Senate seat in November. Republicans hold the majority in both state legislative houses, plus all major statewide offices including  auditor, attorney general and secretary of state.
Republicans also prevailed in a statewide controversy over how state legislative districts are drawn that many say allows polarization of state politics to continue. Though the state supreme court ruled five times that Republicans had gerrymandered state House and Senate unfairly, Ohio voters sided with Republicans in November on a ballot issue that would have redrawn districts under a new process.
Ohio voters reject Issue 1, leaving politicians in control over map-making process

Critics charge that candidates don’t have to appeal to both sides, since districts are set up so races are really decided in Republican primaries.
“It (the legislature) has definitely moved towards a much more ideological conservative view,” said Christina Collins, a former state school board member who now heads the left-leaning Honesty for Ohio Education nonprofit.
“It is easier for them to keep up these attacks and to keep the rhetoric going and the vitriol and to keep stirring their base, which is what seems to be happening,” she said.
Ohio’s transgender bathroom ban, though proposed months earlier, passed after the November election. The state legislature followed that by passing a bill in December allowing students to leave school during the school day for religious lessons and creating a “parental bill of rights” that requires schools to tell parents about “any request by a student to identify as a gender that does not align with the student’s biological sex.”
Schools must also inform parents before students can receive any mental health services, which would also include counseling over gender identity or sexual preference. While supporters praise the bill for letting parents, not schools, decide how to handle student sexuality issues, others blasted the bill as requiring schools to “out” students and expose them to violence.
Schools have until July to set policy for how to inform parents, but counselors are bracing for a “chilling effect” the bill would have on students seeking any type of help.
“Many students struggle with unsafe or unwelcoming homes, homes ravaged by poverty or stress, or even comfortable homes where students just sometimes feel the need to vent about family matters,” Douglas Cook testified in hearings on the bill on behalf of the Ohio School  Counselors Association. “School counselors’ offices are safe spaces for those students.”
“This will likely be incredibly jarring for students and result in their being scared that they will lose the privacy of having a safe listener available to them at school,” Cook added.
This year, after Trump started his own campaign in January against what he called “radical indoctrination” in schools, Ohio quickly passed a ban on DEI in training and hiring in state colleges. The law also regulates teaching of “controversial beliefs” including foreign policy, diversity, immigration, abortion and climate change.
Gov. Mike DeWine signed that ban Friday after heated debates with 1,500 pieces of written testimony submitted and student marches in protest. Opponents labeled it the “HIgher Education Destruction Act” that amounts to state censorship of educators.
Ohio Gov. DeWine signs higher ed bill regulating classroom discussion and banning diversity efforts

State Sen. Jerry Cirino, the bill’s author said it “will return our public universities and colleges to their rightful mission of education rather than indoctrination.”
In the latest move, bills blocking DEI in training and hiring, though not lessons, in K-12 schools are being heard in the Ohio House and Senate.
Legislators are also seeking a “Given Name Act” that would yank funding from schools that let students change their name or pronouns and another bill that would declare the Ten Commandments a historical document like the Constitution or Magna Carta so schools can post them.
Support from voters for the new laws isn’t clear, though a poll in February led by Bowling Green State University found some backing. The poll found residents backed Trump’s order that there are just two sexes 61 percent to 32 percent. Support for anti-DEI policies was more narrow, 49 percent to 42 percent.

Reporting Highlights

Unexpected Role: Flight attendants were told they would fly rock bands, sports teams and sun-seekers. Then Global Crossing Airlines started expanding into federal deportation flights.
Human Struggles: Some flight attendants said they ignored orders not to interact with detainees. “I’d say ‘hola’ back,” said one flight attendant. “We’re not jerks.”
Safety Concerns: Flight attendants received training in how to evacuate passengers but said they weren’t told how to usher out detainees whose hands and legs were bound by shackles.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The deportation flight was in the air over Mexico when chaos erupted in the back of the plane, the flight attendant recalled. A little girl had collapsed. She had a high fever and was taking ragged, frantic breaths.
The flight attendant, a young woman who went by the nickname Lala, said she grabbed the plane’s emergency oxygen bottle and rushed past rows of migrants chained at the wrists and ankles to reach the girl and her parents.
By then, Lala was accustomed to the hard realities of working charter flights for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She’d learned to obey instructions not to look the passengers in the eyes, not to greet them or ask about their well-being. But until the girl collapsed, Lala had managed to escape an emergency.
Lala worked for Global Crossing Airlines, the dominant player in the loose network of deportation contractors known as ICE Air. GlobalX, as the charter company is also called, is lately in the news. Two weeks ago, it helped the Trump administration fly hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador despite a federal court order blocking the deportations, triggering a showdown that experts fear could become a full-blown constitutional crisis.
In interviews with ProPublica, Lala and six other current and former GlobalX flight attendants provided a window into a part of the deportation process that is rarely seen and little understood. For migrants who have spent months or years trying to reach this country and live here, it is the last act, the final bit of America they may experience.
All but one of the flight attendants requested anonymity or asked that only a nickname be used, fearing retribution or black marks as they looked for new jobs in an insular industry.
Because ICE, GlobalX and other charter carriers did not respond to questions after being provided with detailed lists of this story’s findings, the flight attendants’ individual accounts are hard to verify. But their stories are consistent with one another. They are also generally consistent with what has been said about ICE Air in legalfilings, newsaccounts, academic research and publicly released copies of the ICE Air Operations Handbook.
That morning over Mexico, Lala said, the girl’s oxygen saturation level was 70% — perilously low compared with a healthy person’s 95% or higher. Her temperature was 102.3 degrees. The flight had a nurse on contract who worked alongside its security guards. But beyond giving the girl Tylenol, the nurse left the situation in Lala’s hands, she recalled.
Lala broke the rule about talking to detainees. The parents told Lala their daughter had a history of asthma. The mom, who Lala said had epilepsy, seemed on the verge of her own medical crisis.
Lala placed the oxygen mask on the girl’s face. The nurse removed her socks to keep her from further overheating. Lala counted down the minutes, praying for the girl to keep breathing.
The stories shared by ICE Air flight attendants paint a different picture of deportations from the one presented to the public, especially under President Donald Trump. On social media, the White House has depicted a military operation carried out with ruthless efficiency, using Air Force C-17s, ICE agents in tactical vests and soldiers in camo.
The reality is that 85% of the administration’s “removal” flights — 254 flights as of March 21, according to the advocacy group Witness at the Border — have been on charter planes. Military flights have now all but ceased. While there are ICE officers and hired security guards on the charters, the crew members on board are civilians, ordinary people swept up in something most didn’t knowingly sign up for.
When the flight attendants joined GlobalX, it was a startup with big plans. It sold investors and new hires alike on a vision of VIP clients, including musicians and sports teams, and luxury destinations, especially in the Caribbean. “You can’t beat the eXperience,” read a company tagline.

But as the airline grew, more and more of its planes were filled with migrants in chains. Some flight attendants were livid about it.
Last year, an anonymous GlobalX employee sent an all-caps, all-staff screed that ricocheted around the startup. “WHERE IS THE COMPANY GOING?” the email asked. “YOU SIGNED A 5 YEAR CONTRACT WITH ICE? … WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS BECOMING A PRESTIGE CHARTER AIRLINE?”
One flight attendant said he kept waiting for the sports teams his new bosses had talked about as he flew deportation routes. “You know, the NFL charters, the NBA charters, whatever the hockey one is …” he said.
A second said his planes’ air conditioning kept breaking — an experience consistent with at least two publicly reported onboard incidents — and their lavatories kept breaking, something another flight attendant reported as well. But the planes kept flying. “They made us flush with water bottles,” he said.
But the flight attendants were most concerned about their inability to treat their passengers humanely — and to keep them safe. (In 2021, an ICE spokesperson told the publication Capital & Main that the agency “follows best practices when it comes to the security, safety and welfare of the individuals returned to their countries of origin.”)
They worried about what would happen in an emergency. Could they really get over a hundred chained passengers off the plane in time?
“They never taught us anything regarding the immigration flights,” one said. “They didn’t tell us these people were going to be shackled, wrists to fucking ankles.”
“We have never gotten a clear answer on what we do in an ICE Air evacuation,” another said. “They will not give us an answer.”
“It’s only a matter of time,” a third said, before a deportation flight ends in disaster.
Lala didn’t think she had a chance at a flight attendant job. She hadn’t, in truth, remembered applying to GlobalX until a recruiter called to say the startup was coming to her city. “But I guess I did apply through LinkedIn?” she said. She’d been working an office job — long hours, little flexibility — and was looking for something new.
The job interviews were held at a resort hotel. The room was packed with dozens of aspirants when Lala showed up. After the first round, only about 20 were asked to stay. She couldn’t believe she was one of them. After the second round came a job offer: $26 an hour plus a daily expense allowance. Soon Lala got a uniform: a blue cardigan, a white polo shirt and an eye-catching scarf in cyan and light green.
For part of her Federal Aviation Administration-mandated four-week training, her class stayed in a motel with a pool at the edge of Miami International Airport. Just across the street, on the fourth floor of a concrete-clad office building ringed by palm trees, was GlobalX’s headquarters.
“In the beginning, we were told that because it’s a charter, it’s only gonna be elites, celebrities,” Lala said. “Everybody was really excited.”
But flying was not going to be all glitz. The real reason for having flight attendants is safety. GlobalX was certified by the FAA as a Part 121 scheduled air carrier, the same as United or Delta, and it and its crew members were subject to the same strict standards.
“We’re there to evacuate you,” one recruit told ProPublica. “Yes, we make good drinks, but we evacuate you.”
Lala’s class practiced water landings in the pool at the nearby Pan Am Flight Academy. They practiced door drills — yelling out commands, shoving open heavy exit doors — in a replica Airbus A320 cabin. They learned CPR and how to put out fires. They took written and physical tests, and if they didn’t score at least 90%, they had to retake them.
They were reminded, over and over, that their job was a vocation, one with a professional code: No matter who the passengers were, flight attendants were in charge of the cabin, responsible for safety in the air.
Lala’s official “airman” certificate arrived from the FAA a few weeks after training was done. She was cleared to fly, ready to see the world.
But what she would see wasn’t what she signed up for. The company was growing beyond glamorous charters. GlobalX was moving into the deportation business.
Her bosses delivered the news casually, she recalled: “It was like, ‘Oh yeah, we got a government contract.’”
The new graduates were offered a single posting: Harlingen, Texas. Deportation flights were five days a week, sometimes late into the night. Lala went to Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia and, for refueling, Panama.
A standard flight had more than a dozen private security guards — contractors working for the firm Akima — along with a single ICE officer, two nurses, and a hundred or more detainees. (Akima did not respond to a request for comment.) The guards were in charge of delivering food and water to the detainees and taking them to the lavatories. This left the flight attendants, whose presence was required by the FAA, with little to do.
“Arm and disarm doors, that was our duty,” Lala said.
The flights had their own set of rules, which the crew members said they learned from a company policy manual or from chief flight attendants. Don’t talk to the detainees. Don’t feed them. Don’t make eye contact. Don’t walk down the aisles without a guard escorting you. Don’t sit in aisle seats, where detainees could get close to you. Don’t wear your company-issued scarf because of “safety concerns that a detainee might grab it and use it against us,” Lala said.
“You don’t do nothing,” said a member of another GlobalX class. “Just sit down in your seats and be quiet.” If a detainee looked at him, he was supposed to look out the window.
A rare public statement from the company about life aboard ICE Air came in a 2023 earnings call with GlobalX founder and then-CEO Ed Wegel, when he discussed the company’s work for federal agencies like ICE. GlobalX employees “essentially don’t do much on the airplane,” Wegel said. “Our flight attendants are there in case of an emergency. The passengers are monitored by guards that are placed on board the airplane by one of those agencies.”
Fielding a question about how GlobalX ensures passengers are treated humanely, Wegel continued: “There have been threats made to our crew members, and they’re especially trained to deal with those. But we haven’t seen any mistreatment at all.”
Flight attendants said they had little to do but sit in their jumpseats after delivering the preflight safety briefing in English to the mostly Spanish-speaking passengers. Above 10,000 feet, the two in the rear usually moved to passenger rows near the cockpit, then sat again. Some did crosswords. Others took photos out the window. On a deportation to Guatemala, one saw his first erupting volcano.
Lala had been scared before her first deportation flight, worried that violence might break out. But fear soon gave way to discomfort at how detainees were treated. “Not being able to serve them, not being able to look at them, I didn’t think that was right,” she said.
Some flight attendants, drawn to the profession because they liked taking care of people, couldn’t help but break protocol with passengers. “If they said ‘hola’ or something,” one said, “I’d say ‘hola’ back. We’re not jerks.”
Another recalled taking a planeload of children and their escorts on a domestic transfer from the southern border to an airport in New York. He tried to slip snacks to the kids. “Even the chaperones were like, ‘Don’t give them any food,’” he said. “And I’m like, ‘Where is your humanity?’” (A second flight attendant said that children on a New York flight were fed by their escorts.)
While flight attendants were allowed to interact with the guards, the dynamic was uncomfortable. It came down to a question of who was in charge — and which agency, ICE or the FAA, ultimately held sway. (The FAA declined to comment on this story and directed questions to ICE.)
The guards often asked flight attendants to heat up the food they brought from home. They asked for drinks, for ice. “They treated us like we were their maids,” said Akilah Sisk, a former flight attendant from Texas.
“In their eyes, the detainees are not the passengers,” another flight attendant said. “The passengers are the guards. And we’re there for the guards.”
Some guards thumbed their noses at the FAA safety rules that flight attendants were supposed to enforce while airborne, multiple flight attendants recalled. “One reported me because I asked him to sit down in the last 10 minutes,” Sisk said. “But you’re still on a freaking plane. You gotta listen to our words.”
Flight attendants said that if they told guards to fasten seatbelts during takeoff or stow carry-ons under a seat, they risked getting reported to their bosses at GlobalX, who they said wanted to keep ICE happy. The guards would complain to the in-flight supervisor, Sisk said, and eventually it would get back to the flight attendant.
“We’d get an email from somebody in management: ‘Why are you guys causing problems?’” another flight attendant recalled. “They were more worried about losing the contract than about anything else.”
Nothing bothered flight attendants more than the fact that most of their passengers were in chains. What would happen if a flight had to be evacuated?
Most of the migrants crowding the back seats of ICE Air’s planes have not been, historically, convicted criminals. ICE makes restraints mandatory nonetheless. “Detainees transported by ICE Air aircraft will be fully restrained by the use of handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons,“ reads an unredacted version of the 2015 ICE Air Operations Handbook, which was obtained by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy group.
The handbook allows for other equipment “in special circumstances, i.e., spit masks, mittens, leg braces, cargo straps, humane restraint blanket, etc.” Multiple lawsuits on behalf of African asylum-seekers concern the use of one such item, known as the Wrap, a cross between a straitjacket and a sleeping bag. A flight attendant said detainees restrained in the device are strapped upright in their seats or, if less compliant, lengthwise across a row of seats. Getting “burritoed, I call it,” the person said.
The Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigated the asylum-seekers’ complaints and found ICE lacked “sufficient policies” on the Wrap, but how the immigration agency addressed the finding is not publicly known. ICE responded to one lawsuit by saying detainees were not abused; it said another should be dismissed, in part because it was filed in the wrong place. The cases are pending.
Use of the Wrap continues. A video from Seattle’s Boeing Field taken in February shows officers and guards carrying a wrapped migrant into the cabin of a deportation plane.

Neither the ICE Air handbook, nor FAA regulations, nor flight attendant training in Miami explained how to empty a plane full of people whose movements were, by design, so severely hampered. Shackled detainees didn’t even qualify as “able-bodied” enough to sit in exit rows.
To flight attendants, the restraints seemed at odds with the FAA’s “90-second rule,” a decades-old manufacturing standard that says an aircraft must be built for full evacuation in 90 seconds even with half the exits blocked.
Lala and others said no one told them how to evacuate passengers in chains. “Honestly, I don’t know what we would do,” she said.
The flight attendants are not alone in voicing concerns.
In an interview with ProPublica, Bobby Laurie, an airline safety expert and former flight attendant, called the arrangement on ICE Air flights “disturbing.”
“Part of flight attendant training is locating those passengers who can help you in an evacuation,” Laurie told ProPublica. That would have to be the guards. “But if they have to help you,” who is helping the detainees, Laurie wondered.
According to formal ICE Air incident reports reviewed by Capital & Main, the deportation network had at least six accidents requiring evacuations between 2014 and 2019. In at least two cases, both on a carrier called World Atlantic, the evacuations were led not by flight attendants but by untrained guards. Both took longer than 90 seconds, though not by much: two-and-a-half minutes for the first, “less than 2 minutes” for the next. But in a third case, it took seven minutes for 115 shackled detainees to escape a smoke-filled jet.
In one of the World Atlantic incidents, part of the landing gear broke, a wing caught fire and the smell of burning rubber seeped in, according to investigative records obtained by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights. In an email to ICE Air officials, an agency employee aboard the plane later wrote that flight attendants made no emergency announcements for passengers. The flight attendants simply got themselves out.
The ICE officer, guards and nurse were “confused on what to do and in which direction to exit during distress,” the officer wrote. He said that other than the flight crew, “no one has received any training on emergency evacuation situations.”
The University of Washington’s collection does not include findings or recommendations from ICE based on what happened, and ICE did not say what they were when asked by ProPublica. The National Transportation Safety Board said that after the accident, World Atlantic launched a campaign to reinspect landing gear, gave employees and contractors further training, and revised its procedures for inspections. The airline did not respond to questions from ProPublica.

Other reports obtained by the University of Washington mention fuel spills, loss of cabin air pressure and a “large altercation” on ICE Air after 2019 but no more evacuations, at least as of June 2022. More recent incidents that have been mentioned in the press include an engine fire last summer on World Atlantic and a failed GlobalX air conditioning unit that sent 11 detainees to the hospital with “heat-related injuries.”
The rare guidance some flight attendants said they received on carrying out ICE Air evacuations came during briefings from pilots. What they heard, they said, was chilling and went against their training.
“Just get up and leave,” one recalled a GlobalX pilot telling him. “That’s it. … Save your life first.”
He understood the instructions to mean that evacuating detainees was not a priority, or even the flight attendants’ responsibility. The detainees were in other people’s hands, or in no one’s.
When asked if they got similar guidance from pilots, three flight attendants said they did not, and one did not answer. Two more, like the first, said pilots gave them instructions that they took to mean they shouldn’t help detainees after opening the exit doors.
“That was the normal briefing,” said a flight attendant from Lala’s class. “‘If a fire occurs in the cabin, if we land on water, don’t check on the immigrants. Just make sure that you and the guards and the people that work for the government get off.’”
“It was as if the detainees’ lives were worthless,” said the other.
The day the girl collapsed on Lala’s flight, the pilot turned the plane around and they crossed back into the United States.
The flight landed in Arizona. Paramedics rushed on board and connected the girl to their own oxygen bottle. They began shuttling her off the plane. Her parents tried to join. But the guards stopped the father.
Shocked, Lala approached the ICE officer in charge. “This is not OK!” she yelled. The mom had seizures. The family needed to stay together.
But the officer said it was impossible. Only one parent could go to the hospital. The other, as Lala understood it, “was going to get deported.”
Most of the flight attendants who spoke with ProPublica are now gone from GlobalX. Some left because they found other jobs. Some left even though they hadn’t. Some left because the charter company, as it focused more and more on deportations, shut down the hub in their city.
Lala eventually left because of the little girl and her family, because she couldn’t do the deportation flights anymore. Her GlobalX uniform hung in her closet for a time, a reminder of her career as a flight attendant. Recently, she said, she threw it away.
She never learned whether the little girl lived or died. Lala just watched her mom follow her off the plane, then watched the dad return to his seat.
“I cried after that,” she said. She bought her own ticket home.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/propublica_iceflights-edits-2_preview_maxWidth_1600_maxHeight_1600-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 05:01:54.961038

Jerry Moran's photo at the virtual town hall to express concerns over Moran's response to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Prairie Hollow Youtube channel)Many years ago, when I interviewed Wes Jackson for a “Sunflower Journeys” story related to his work at The Land Institute near Salina, he referenced a book by his friend Wendell Berry — “The Unsettling of America.”
A line he told me has been going through my head lately: “They didn’t know what they were doing because they didn’t know what they were un-doing.”
Those may not be the precise words, but that’s the gist of it. It pertained to Berry’s assessment of the way that industrialized agriculture historically plowed through the native prairies of the continent without bothering to understand the nature of the ecological relationships that were disrupted and destroyed.
I recall this quote as I consider what’s happening to the social and cultural relationships being dismantled by the wrecking crew known as DOGE, the so-called “government efficiency” team led by Elon Musk.
They, too, don’t know what they’re doing, it seems to me. More significantly, they don’t care what they’re un-doing. It leaves many of us wondering what the real objective of this ongoing assault on our federal workforce and government institutions may be.
Is this really an effort to reduce the federal debt and deficit or a way to bring our democratic system of government crashing down to consolidate power in the hands of oligarchs, autocrats and Christian Nationalists? Are Republicans in Congress refraining from questioning it because it suits their goals and gives them a degree of deniability while insulating them from responsibility?
Town halls have sprung up across the nation as Americans express their concern and attempt to get some answers from their congressional representatives. A number of these gatherings have taken place in Kansas over the past few weeks.
As Grace Hills reported in a Kansas Reflector piece a few weeks ago, my wife, Laura Mead, spearheaded the organization of a virtual town hall directed at Sen. Jerry Moran in February. Neither he nor any of his staff responded to our invitation, so participants directed their questions and comments to an empty chair with his name and photo placed upon it.
We staged this as an event on Zoom, with more than 30 participants from across Kansas joining us to deliver their comments and pose their questions to the senator. There was a mix of political affiliations, veterans of both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, farmers and federal employees, as well as disability advocates, and mothers concerned about cuts to Medicaid and social services.
We streamed the event live on YouTube, where more than a thousand others tuned in that Saturday afternoon for the three-hour session and where more than 13,000 have since viewed the video.
As we ended the session, we requested that Moran provide a response to the concerns and questions directed to him. Everyone had maintained a respectful tone of civility, and no one was intent upon slandering his character. They simply wanted him to respond and acknowledge that he was listening and cognizant of their concerns.
We provided the senator’s office with a report of what had transpired as well as with links to the recording of the event. We edited an abridged version along with a six-minute “highlight reel,” also providing links to those, expecting that the senator or a senior staff member would take a few minutes to view the material.
We had initially decided to direct our town hall to Moran because he appears to be the only Republican representing Kansas at the federal level who might possibly be responsive.
It has been more than five weeks since this town hall took place, and we have yet to receive a response of any kind from Moran or his staff.
In the meantime, we have maintained a glimmer of hope that the senator will eventually stand up to the DOGE juggernaut. He expressed his own concerns about the impact cuts are having on Kansas farmers and veterans and voiced muted criticism of the recent debacle involving cabinet secretaries in a Signal group chat about the attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen.
As President Donald Trump and his administration “flood the zone” with all kinds of destabilizing actions, from market-tanking tariffs to hints that the executive branch is not bound to comply with court orders, many of us are upset and angered by the dissolution of the values we have always associated with this country.
A protest rally is scheduled to take place this Saturday, April 5, on the east steps of the state Capitol in Topeka. As we have seen with weekly protests in Lawrence and a recent one in Kansas City, the number of people opposed to the DOGE cuts and to the direction this administration is taking continues to grow. The turnout for Saturday’s rally will be another indicator of how Kansans feel about the situation.
The unsettling of America continues.
I wonder if Moran and some of his colleagues might feel a bit unsettled, too, especially after Cory Booker’s rabble-rousing address in the Senate this week.

Seventy percent of Americans, including majorities of both Democratic and Republican voters, say that marijuana should be legal. Yet far too often, lawmakers choose to either ignore this constituency or treat them with outright hostility.
In Republican-led states like Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas, elected officials are making it clear that election outcomes legalizing marijuana no longer matter to them. And in Democratic-led states like Maryland, Michigan, and New Jersey, lawmakers are seeking to undermine existing legalization markets by drastically hiking marijuana-related taxes.
In all cases, elected officials are treating cannabis consumers as targets, not constituents.
Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers in South Dakota sought to repeal the state’s medical cannabis access law, despite 70% of voters having approved it. The effort failed, but only by a single vote.
In Nebraska, lawmakers are also considering legislation to roll back the state’s voter-approved medical marijuana law — and Republican Attorney General Mike Hilgers has urged lawmakers to ignore the election results altogether.
In Ohio, GOP lawmakers in the Senate recently approved legislation to rescind many of the legalization provisions approved by 57% of voters in 2023. Changes advanced by lawmakers include limiting home-cultivation rights and creating new crimes for adults who share cannabis with one another or purchase legal cannabis products from out of state.
In Texas, Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued several cities, including Dallas, for implementing voter-approved ordinances decriminalizing marijuana possession. As a result, local lawmakers in various cities — including Lockhart and Bastrop — are ignoring voters’ decisions to amend their municipal marijuana policies rather than face costly litigation.

In Idaho, Republican Gov. Brad Little signed mandatory minimum penalties into law for low-level marijuana possession. And GOP lawmakers have approved a constitutional amendment forbidding voters from weighing in on any future ballot measure to legalize marijuana.
And in Florida, where a 2024 marijuana legalization narrowly failed — it received majority support but less than the 60% threshold required under the state law — Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is leading the charge to make it harder for future petitions to qualify for the ballot.
These concerted attacks are an explicit reminder that the war on cannabis and its consumers remains ongoing — and in some cases is even escalating.
Blue states haven’t made moves to roll back legalization or reverse election results. But several Democratic governors are looking to balance their budget deficits on the backs of consumers.
For instance, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has proposed raising the state’s marijuana-related taxes nearly five-fold. A Maryland budget proposal seeks to nearly double the special sales tax consumers pay on retail marijuana purchases. And in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has proposed an additional 32% wholesale tax on cannabis.
If enacted, these proposed increases will not only lighten consumers’ wallets, but they will also hurt state-licensed businesses. As lawmakers push marijuana prices artificially higher, many consumers will exit the legal market and begin patronizing the unregulated marketplace, undermining one of the primary goals of legalization.
Regardless of whether you live in a red or blue state, or in a jurisdiction where cannabis is legal or illicit, it’s time for legalization advocates to stand up and assert themselves. Cannabis consumers are neither criminals nor ATMs. They’re hard-working responsible adults. And they vote.
Now is not the time to become complacent or presume that marijuana will somehow legalize itself. Change only occurs when advocates agitate for it — and when elected officials fear political consequences for failing to abide by voters’ demands.
Those who support legalizing marijuana aren’t part of the ideological fringe. They’re the majority. It’s time for advocates to act like it — and for lawmakers to treat cannabis consumers with the respect they deserve.

(David Montgomery/Stateline)WATER VALLEY, Texas — On a recent day when the wind gusted close to 40 miles per hour, 82-year-old George Neill was making repairs on his ranch, oblivious to the nearby cluster of wind turbines churning the sky behind him.
“After about a year, you never know the things are here,” said Neill, who leases part of his West Texas property to an East Coast-based renewable energy company that placed three wind turbines on it four years ago.
Hundreds of other wind turbines stretch across this landscape, instantly visible to motorists traveling to nearby San Angelo and other towns. The turbines aren’t the only renewable energy producers amid the mesas: From a distance, a glistening array of solar panels resembles a small lake.
Texas is famous for producing oil and gas, but renewable energy has become deeply embedded in the state’s culture and economy. Texas led the nation in generating electricity from wind power and utility-scale solar power in 2023, and wind and solar energy projects contribute tax revenue to local governments and struggling school districts. Texas landowners are expected to receive nearly $30 billion in lease payments under current and expected projects, according to an industry study.
But in recent years, Texas has loosened its political embrace of alternative energy. For the second legislative session in a row, many Texas lawmakers are trying to derail or curb future renewable energy projects.










They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.


– Joshua Rhodes, research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin


The shift is rooted in a number of a factors, including the second Trump administration’s antipathy toward renewables and an aggressive recommitment to fossil fuels in Texas energy policy. There is lingering concern over the reliability of the state’s electrical grid, after all types of power sources failed during a devastating 2021 winter storm. Some people object to the aesthetics of wind and solar farms, or note that turbines and panels can harm some wildlife.
Texas is not alone. Once focused on stopping individual projects at the local level, renewable energy opponents have been making inroads in other state legislatures, too. They have received backing from the oil and gas industry. And they’ve been galvanized by the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest-ever attempt to speed the transition to clean energy.
In neighboring Oklahoma, for example, hundreds of people rallied at the state Capitol in January to urge Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order halting new wind and solar projects. Like Texas, Oklahoma is a major oil and natural gas producer, but it generated 45% of its total in-state electricity from renewable resources in 2023.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Stitt, a strong supporter of renewable energy, is highly unlikely to issue such an order. But he will leave office in two years, and several Republicans discussed as possible successors appeared at the rally. One of them, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, last month on social media criticized what he called “the green energy scam” and urged Stitt and state lawmakers to tighten wind farm rules during the current session.
In Arizona, the House earlier this year approved a bill that would bar wind farm projects within a dozen miles of any property zoned for residential use — a restriction that would apply to about 90% of the land in the state, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.
In Ohio, a 2021 law allowing county commissioners to create restricted areas where utility-scale solar and wind projects can’t be built has had a huge impact, as 26 Ohio counties have banned renewable energy projects. This year, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation that would end all state solar subsidies.
And in Missouri, Republican legislators are pushing a bill that would raise taxes on farmers who lease their land for wind or solar energy projects.
The expanding opposition to renewables isn’t unexpected, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the power grid. He noted that wind, solar and battery storage have rapidly become the “cheapest way to put more energy on the grid.”
“They’re victims of their own success,” he told Stateline. “They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.”
 Opposing sides

At the center of the current debate in Texas is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican committee chair who has resurrected a 2023 bill that would require new utility-scale solar and wind projects to get permits from the state’s Public Utility Commission, regulations that aren’t imposed on projects for natural gas and other energy sources. The bill also calls for set-back requirements and cleanup funds.










The land isn’t just a piece of property to us. It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are.


– Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County, Texas


Kolkhorst, in a statement to Stateline, called the legislation “a common-sense approach to the encroachment of wind and solar facilities being scattered across our great state with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment.”
At an hourslong Senate committee hearing recently where opponents of Kolkhorst’s bill outnumbered supporters, farmers, ranchers and small-town Texans sometimes found themselves on opposite sides, either arguing that sprawling wind farms and solar arrays are a lasting source of economic vitality or a threat to a beloved way of life.
“The land isn’t just a piece of property to us,” said Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County with her husband. “It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are. When we look out across the road, we see rolling green pastures and trees. Now we’re facing the possibility of that view and so much more being replaced by a sprawling solar farm.”
Environmentalists and industry representatives view Kolkhorst’s bill as a roadblock in the march toward green energy. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said the bill would open the door to “a really arbitrary discriminatory permitting regime,” requiring wind and solar developers to get permits that other energy producers do not have to have.
Describing herself as a “lifelong wildlife conservationist,” Kolkhorst said she introduced the bipartisan bill with nine other senators in an effort that “looks past the billions in wind and solar subsidies to instead focus on the total impact of these projects on our land, people and wildlife.”
But oil and gas projects also can harm wildlife, and scientists note that the emissions released by fossil fuels worsen climate change disasters.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

Insiders following the legislation, including Metzger, identify one of the bill’s major supporters as Kolkhorst donor Dan Friedkin, a billionaire Houston businessman.
Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, is owner and CEO of The Friedkin Group, a consortium of businesses and investments that includes Gulf States Toyota. Gulf States is one of the world’s largest distributors of Toyota vehicles and parts, with exclusive rights to sell Toyotas in Texas and four other states. Gulf States Toyota Inc. State PAC made four donations totaling $42,500 to Kolkhorst from October of 2020 to October of 2024, according to the Texas Ethics Commission.
Friedkin is a stunt pilot and outdoorsman with a ranch in South Texas. Neither he nor his lobbyist, Laird Doran, senior vice president for public and legal affairs at The Friedkin Group, returned phone calls from Stateline.
Texas lawmakers have filed dozens of wind- and solar-related bills this session, including measures aimed at restricting the placement of battery storage facilities, curbing tax breaks and subsidies for renewable companies and limiting the amount of electricity solar and wind projects contribute to the state’s power grid.
Republican state Sen. Phil King, for example, is pushing a bill that would mandate that 50% of all new electricity must come from natural gas, nuclear or battery storage. King said solar and wind power should be part of the state’s energy mix, but he claims they aren’t reliable enough to serve as the foundation.
State Rep. Don McLaughlin, a Republican, has introduced legislation mandating a study of the economic impact of wind and solar projects on local communities, as well as noise and health effects, threats to wildlife and the challenges of disassembling worn-out systems. Sweetwater, Texas, has thousands of composite blades piled up in “a windmill graveyard.”
 Rural support

But many rural GOP lawmakers whose districts long ago sprouted oil rigs and pump jacks are now strong supporters of wind and solar power.
“It’s nonstop windmills on both side of the road for 70 miles,” said state Rep. John Smithee of Amarillo, describing a typical drive from his hometown in the Texas Panhandle to the Capitol in Austin. “Almost all of those [constituents] have benefited.”
Solar energy and its cheaper bills are coming to more disadvantaged communities

State Rep. Drew Darby, whose northwest Texas district includes San Angelo and Water Valley, an unincorporated community of around 300, said revenue from wind power has resulted in countywide improvements and lease payments to property owners.
“It’s been a positive impact on rural effectiveness,” said Darby. “Landowners … are receiving nice payments for leasing the property.”
In Water Valley, taxes from the increased revenue paved the way for a tax-free bond election that enabled the town’s K-12 school to add an upscale weight room, a technical educational facility and a “cafetorium” that serves as a dining room and performance hall. The school building had previously been so small that students had to eat in shifts.
The wind farm is expected to generate $123 million in local taxes over the 30-year life of the project, as well as more than $100 million in payments to landowners.
George Neill, the West Texas rancher, said he takes the wind turbines in stride as he roams across his 1,700-acre spread.
He’s not at liberty to reveal the amount of his payments. He’s not getting rich, he said, but the money “makes a difference when you’re trying run a ranch.”

While rural hospitals serve as the frontline of care for their communities, they depend on our urban medical centers for advanced specialty care, training and research. This collaboration ensures that patients statewide have access to vital local care backed by nation-leading facilities and specialists.
Over the past two decades, the University of Nebraska Medical Center has strategically expanded its rural initiatives through medical education, research and clinical care in partnership with Nebraska Medicine.
This includes innovative facilities like the Davis Global Center, with world-class clinical simulation training and the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, which advances life-saving research and treatment. These institutions have revolutionized training and care for infectious disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Now, UNMC is taking its next step forward with Project Health, a landmark public-private partnership that will have a transformative impact on Nebraska.
This project, the largest to date for the University of Nebraska System, will create a new $2.19 billion health care facility at UNMC and Nebraska Medicine that will serve as a clinical learning center to educate and train the next generation of health care providers.
Biomedical scientists will conduct world-class medical research and provide clinical trials to hone prevention and treatment methods for all Nebraskans and beyond.
Our state has tremendous needs when it comes to healthcare. Many counties in western and central Nebraska have no or few primary care physicians. And projections show that Nebraska will experience a workforce shortage of over 5,000 nurses this year
alone. It’s vital for Nebraska to have a robust long-term training pipeline for doctors, nurses and other health professionals, and Project Health addresses that need.
Project Health will expand enrollment across UNMC’s educational programs to meet workforce demands. It also will notably support UNMC’s partnership with the University of Nebraska at Kearney Health Sciences Education Complex, where over 300 nursing,
allied health and public health students soon will train alongside medical students and physicians at the new Rural Health Education Building.
Additionally, Project Health will expand rural clinical rotations and medical education, ensuring that health professionals are prepared in rural hospitals and clinics — a key indicator of a physician practicing in a rural community after their residency training.
Over the course of Project Health’s construction through 2033, Nebraska will see a projected economic impact of $3.2 billion. Once complete, the initiative’s annual contribution to Nebraska’s economy is expected to exceed $1.5 billion.
Project Health is the first step of several within a larger initiative — Project NExT, short for Nebraska Transformation. In 2020, our Legislature voted to support Project NExT to address Nebraska’s healthcare workforce shortage. Now, the University of Nebraska is ready to move forward with key steps to bring this vision into reality.
For a transformative project of this scale, public and private support are vital. Project Health is supported through a partnership that includes funding from state appropriations, private philanthropy, local government support and institutional investments. This wide-ranging support shows broad consensus for strengthening Nebraska’s future healthcare capability.
By supporting the state’s investment in Project Health, the Unicameral helps ensure that Nebraskans, no matter where they live, have access to high-quality, affordable care.
Project Health is the first step, but the vision for Project NExT is much broader — it will create a thriving and ever-changing workforce pipeline that meets the evolving needs of our state.
Project Health serves multiple statewide goals — as a commitment to the well-being of Nebraskans, a driver of economic development and an investment returning benefits to the state for generations. After all, strong rural health makes for a strong rural
Nebraska, ensuring communities remain vibrant and sustainable. UNMC is ready to move forward with next steps, in a spirit of innovation and dedication, to serve all of Nebraska and its healthcare needs.

The bill, which effectively hollowed out legislation originally aimed at increasing sick days and maternity leave for public school teachers, passed in a contentious 33-21 vote, restricting the freedom educational institutions have to discuss racial justice issues even as lawmakers across the hall voted to expand First Amendment protections based on religion only hours before.
House Bill 127’s sponsor in the Senate, Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns, argued that the bill was aimed at preventing discrimination in Georgia’s public educational institutions.
“DEI is the antithesis of equality,” Burns said on the Senate floor. “If you believe in equality, if you believe in equal opportunity, this bill does not strip you of that. It enhances it.”
Democrats swiftly condemned the bill, arguing that a ban on DEI would be a return to an era of “state-sponsored discrimination.” They also feared it could be used to censor topics like slavery’s role in the civil war and other ways that race and racism have shaped American history.
“I don’t want to say DEI, I want to talk about diversity, equity and inclusion,” said Derek Mallow, a Savannah Democrat. “If there is a need to ban DEI, then what is the opposite to diversity? Well the opposite to diversity is uniformity, and to be uniform means that you lack any other options for anyone to be different, to look different, to talk different, to walk different, to be different.”
They also proposed a total of 20 amendments — the most on any individual bill in living memory — but all 20 amendments were dismissed without a vote by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. 
“This is a sad day for the Georgia state Senate, one of the saddest I’ve ever been in in 10 years, quite frankly,” said Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones II, an Augusta Democrat. 
“This doesn’t represent the people of Georgia,” he continued. “Tonight was a night the Republican Party said they’re going to take Georgia backwards — backwards to days when people did not have full rights.”
The bill now returns to the House, which must agree to the Senate’s amendments before the bill can advance to the governor’s desk.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderOn the penultimate day of the 2025 legislative session, some religious Georgians had their prayers answered.
A so-called religious freedom bill is on Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk after the House approved it 96-70 along mostly party lines late Wednesday night.
A Georgia religious freedom restoration act, or RFRA bill, has been a goal of the Georgia GOP since shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015.
Senate Bill 36 by Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler places restrictions on state and local governments’ ability to “substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” unless it is “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and even then only if they use the “least restrictive means of furthering such compelling governmental interest.”
Cedartown Republican Rep. Trey Kelley said that means religious Georgians will have their rights protected from state and local governments the same way they are protected from the federal government under the First Amendment. A federal version passed in 1993.
“What this measure simply looks to do is codify the same balancing test for our exercise of religious freedom that the other four First Amendment rights have,” he said. “This should be something that we can agree to. We got a lot we can fight about. This should be something we can agree to.”
Democrats largely disagreed.
  Rep. Ruwa Romman argues against the RFRA bill. Ross Williams/Georgia
Opponents like Duluth Democratic Rep. Ruwa Romman say the bill would amount to a license to discriminate against those religious minorities and LGBTQ Georgians.
“I think a lot about what if a Muslim woman who wears a headscarf is in a workplace and her boss decides to fire her because it offends his faith?” said Romman, who is Muslim. “What if, for example, somebody is praying, takes five minutes to pray during the day, and their boss says, ‘you know what, you don’t believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and I’m going to fire you. It is my business, I should be able to do that.’ And to some extent, there are already allowances for that to begin with. To me, the negatives far outweigh any potential benefits”
Democrats attempted to add an amendment to the effect that the law could not be used to discriminate but Republicans rejected it.
The state’s only currently-serving Jewish lawmaker, Sandy Springs Democratic Rep. Esther Panitch, said the law could allow discrimination against Jews if it came from a sincere religious belief.

Panitch said determining the motivation of antisemitic acts would mean more work for courts.
“Each case will require an extensive analysis of whether antisemitic expression is truly motivated by sincere religious beliefs,” she said. “The result is that secular antisemitism faces consequences while religiously motivated antisemitism receives protections.”
Both Romman and Panitch predicted RFRA could mean religious carveouts to the state’s abortion law. Panitch said Jews believe life begins at birth rather than at conception as state law says, and Romman said Islam prioritizes saving the life of a mother and the RFRA bill would make it impossible to live out that mandate.
Avondale Estates Democratic Rep. Karla Drenner, who became the Legislature’s first openly-LGBTQ member when she took office in 2001, read from the speech she read opposing a RFRA bill in 2016.
“I must note that the irony of debating the bill that licenses prejudice against my community in the city too busy to hate is not lost on me,” she said. “I oppose – back then it was House Bill 757, today it’s Senate Bill 36 – I oppose it for any number of reasons. It says that my rights under the constitution, under the law and under God are not inalienable but rather are subject to the opinions of others.”
In a surprise move, Republican Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed that year’s RFRA bill.

Drenner also took a swipe at a slate of red meat bills she suggested were signs of weakness in the GOP.
“This year, we have let the other chamber that’s running for governor run our chamber over here, from my perspective,” she said. “We’ve done all these terrible bills, from my perspective.”
Republican representatives took the opposite view.
“I got a little frustrated over there when I was listening, this is dealing with government burdening the free exercise of religion in this state,” said Bremen Republican Rep. Tyler Paul Smith. “This is not a license for a private citizen to use this against another private citizen.”
Dawsonville Republican Rep. Will Wade said the measure will reaffirm Georgians’ bedrock religious freedoms.
“Senate Bill 36 simply gives people of all faiths, all faiths, their day in court if they believe the government has overreached,” he said. “Over half of the states – we’ve heard it today, 39 now, we can be the 40th – It is time that Georgia provide the same safeguards that 39 other states in our country have for their citizens. We are a state very rich in diversity, I think that’s what makes it better.”
Kemp has 40 days from Friday to sign, and has indicated he will do so.
“I want to congratulate those who worked for the passage of SB 36,” he said in a statement. “I have always maintained that I would support and sign a version of RFRA which mirrors the language and protections provided by federal law since 1993. My commitment to that promise and to the deeply held beliefs of Georgians of faith remains unwavering. I also want to assure those of differing views that Georgia remains a welcoming place to live, work, and raise a family.“

John McCosh/Georgia RecorderA late-emerging proposal in the Georgia Legislature would limit what the public can access in police reports and communications with state lawmakers.
The proposed changes to Georgia’s Open Records Act were tacked onto another bill, Senate Bill 12, late in the day Wednesday in the gatekeeping House Rules Committee, bypassing the usual legislative committee process and shortcutting public debate on the measure. 
Under the new proposal, police departments would be able to shield almost all information about officers’ stops, arrests and incident responses, says Sarah Brewerton-Palmer, executive director with the Georgia First Amendment Foundation.
Additionally, the bill would create broad new exemptions to prevent public disclosure of the General Assembly’s activities, including communication with other parts of state government, she said. 
Lawmakers are already largely exempted from the Open Records Act, but the proposal would go further in restricting access, adding records and data prepared for legislators to the list of off-limits information to the public. 
“This is no time to weaken Georgia’s transparency laws, and it would be particularly inappropriate to do so this way — by tacking lengthy amendments onto a bill in the final days of the session, with no opportunity for public comment,” Brewerton-Palmer said.
The bill was changed and advanced out of the House Rules Committee meeting over the objections of Democrats who questioned the sudden urgency and raised concerns about how broad the proposed changes are. 
“I’m a little bit concerned that nobody knows where this came from, and what is the urgency that brings us here on the 39th day at this hour?” said House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley of Columbus during the 7 p.m. meeting.
Rep. Rob Leverett, an Elberton Republican, described the changes as meant to “clean up” aspects of Georgia’s Open Records Act while there was a related bill on the move. The original bill had aimed to clarify that records requests should be filed with government agencies that created the need for the record and not private contractors or vendors – a response to a Georgia Supreme Court ruling last fall. 
The bill was quickly sent back to the House Rules Committee but remains in play for Friday, which is the last day of the 2025 legislative session.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file)A pair of election bills the Georgia Senate passed Wednesday propose new State Election Board powers, remove Georgia from multi-state voter rolls sharing databases and allow voters to request hand-marked paper ballots.
The Senate voted along party lines Wednesday for the sweeping voting rules changes proposed in House Bill 397 as well as Senate Bill 214, which aims to encourage voters to use pencils or pens to complete ballots instead of electronic voting machines as is the primary option now.
Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, criticized plans in the bill sponsored by Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican, that would force the state to withdraw from the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a system that backers including Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger contend helps Georgia maintain more accurate voter rolls by sharing voter data across multiple states.
The Fleming bill would need a final House vote by Friday to clear both chambers.
Esteves said a new system of multiple bilateral agreements to replace ERIC would be much more expensive and inefficient than the status quo.
Republican lawmakers argue the state should withdraw from a third-party system that could lead to voter privacy concerns.
Some Democratic members of the House have voiced opposition to a bill restricting counties from accepting hand-delivered absentee ballots on the weekend before an election, arguing that this could prevent college students and military personnel from voting.
Duluth Democratic Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes slammed the bill for not securing  elections but instead sabotaging them by “sewing distress, empowering conspiracy theorists, and silencing the voices of everyday Georgians.”
“Why are we tossing out a system that works and replacing it with political theater? she said. “HB 397 makes it harder, again, for folks to vote by mail.”
There are also several provisions in the bill aimed at expanding the power of the State Election Board, which has been under fire for its rulemaking in the run-up to the general election in 2024.
The bill would place the election board under the administration of the state accounting office instead of the secretary of state’s office.
State election officials would also have access to all state investigative reports and communications between the secretary of state and the local election superintendents. The bill would also spell out State Election Board rulemaking powers with proposed year-round authority to adopt election rules so long as they don’t take effect within 60 days of an election, according to the legislation.
Cumming Republican Sen. Dolezal rejected claims the legislation as the latest Republican voter suppression effort.
Dolezal said the increased minority voter participation since the passage of the Senate Bill 202 election law overhaul in 2021 demonstrates the law does not discourage minority voting.
“This bill in front of us here deals with processes by which we review who has moved out of the state,” Dolezal said. “We go through the tabulation process and when the election board is going to post information.
“Bringing up this debunked notion that was floated first by Stacey Abrams and then floated by Joe Biden and used to weaponize Major League Baseball to leave the state for a state who has very similar voting laws that we have, was ridiculous then is ridiculous today,” Dolezal said
Last week, Republican legislators advanced lHB 397 out of the Senate Ethics Committee, after making some last-minute changes were made that its sponsors said should alleviate some concerns heard during public meetings.
The current version of the bill no longer includes new mandates for requiring local election officials to hand count ballots as voting precincts are closing down for Election Day. It no longer includes a provision that would have allowed the State Election Board to hear appeals to a controversial mass voter challenge after complaints are settled by county election boards.
Paper ballots expansion spurs debate
Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns defended his Senate Bill 214 hand marked ballot measure as being significantly less costly than the projected $66 million needed to upgrade the current electronic voting system.
Burns said the legislation gives Georgians casting ballots during early voting and election days the option of paper ballots or the electronic touchscreen system that’s been used for statewide elections since 2020.
Burns said Wednesday that the cost of acquiring new scanners and implementing the new system is estimated to be less than half that of enhancing the current system.
Under the new legislation, the state would be required to use new voting equipment that features optical scanning systems for scanning and tabulating hand-marked paper ballots.
The new process would allow voters to request ballots similar to absentee ballots when they visit a polling place during early voting or on an Election. Day.
“The ballot itself is marked by the individual voter,” Burns said. “The voter uses a hand marking device, often called the pen, that marks the ballot that they can read. There is no QR code. They take that hand-marked  paper ballot and they submit it to a scanner, a tabulator that senses the mark on the ballot.”
Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat, cautioned against expressed hesitation in rushing through a significant change in the state’s election system at this late stage in the legislative process, which could result in further financial mismanagement. Friday is the last day of the 2025 Georgia General Assembly.
Harrell wondered aloud why Republican senators rejected her amendment proposing hand-marked paper ballots when lawmakers voted in 2019 to switch to an electronic voting system.
The state has spent more than $107 million on the Dominion Voting Systems that’s been used in statewide elections since 2020.
Harrell requested more information regarding the costs associated with implementing Burns’ new ballot plan while the state is still under a 20-year contract to pay off the Dominion machines until 2040.
Currently, President Donald Trump’s administration is advocating a major overhaul of elections, including guidance advising states  against using barcodes or QR codes to tabulate votes.
“I have some of the same concerns (Esteves) raised about things coming from the federal government about what we can and can’t do over and over again,” Harrell said. “We are deciding to spend money on certain types of machines that we aren’t going to use long enough to justify the expenses. We made that mistake in 2019 and we’re making that same mistake now.”

(Photo by Ben Wasserstein for the Capital-Star)As Republicans face increasingly critical crowds in town halls or avoid them altogether, Rep. Scott Perry (R-10) held a telephone town hall to answer constituents’ questions.
Perry’s event came a week after a Democratic state Senate candidate won a special election in a Trump+15 District in Lancaster County, not far from his own congressional district. And on Tuesday, a liberal candidate for Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court beat a conservative opponent. It was  a race widely seen as a referendum on Trump’s agenda, and in particular the role of billionaire megadonor Elon Musk, who poured millions into the contest.
Perry expressed both praise and skepticism of Musk and his role as the figurehead of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has led the Trump administration’s efforts to slash tens of thousands of federal jobs and cancel contracts across federal agencies – usually without warning. 
The Republican lawmaker also answered questions on the sweeping tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier in the day, efforts to thwart federal judges who have blocked parts of Trump’s agenda, and concerns that Republicans will cut programs like Medicare and Social Security.
The town hall came after weeks of demands for Perry to communicate directly with constituents. He faced some tough questions, but not the rowdy crowds that met other Republicans who held events in person.
As Trump came into office and quickly began slashing federal spending and cutting tens of thousands of jobs, voters in the 10th Congressional District demanded their representative’s ear. Beginning in February, there were protests outside of his district offices. And last month, labor leaders and other advocates held a town hall in his absence at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Conference Center in Swatara Township, Dauphin County, that drew around 150 constituents.

Praise and skepticism of Elon Musk
Multiple callers asked Perry about Musk, who has become one of the most prominent and controversial figures in the Trump administration’s orbit.
Perry, who has echoed many of Musk’s claims of fraud and waste on social media, expressed both praise and skepticism of the entrepreneur-turned-presidential advisor. 
Ultimately, he said that it’s been a source of “frustration” that Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has not been more transparent about their claims that their sweeping cuts have saved tens of billions of dollars.
His statement was in response to a question about why lawmakers had to raise the debt ceiling, despite Musk’s claimed spending cuts.
“I will tell you, I have a personal frustration,  and we have asked, ‘Let’s see the details on DOGE,’” Perry said. “We can’t see granularly at this point. I know there’s a website and it says, ‘We have eliminated this contract’ or ‘We have eliminated this spending.’ But we have to put that in a frame of reference in the appropriations bill to see where that came from.”
Musk’s DOGE has come under fire practically since it started operating, in part because of false or exaggerated claims of savings. Following media fact checks, the New York Times reported that DOGE made changes to its website which made it harder to independently verify claims of savings. 
Though that has not stopped Perry from sharing Musk’s unverified claims of finding fraud on social media. 
But, he also praised DOGE, and their work identifying inefficiencies in the government’s record-keeping systems. Perry noted those systems are too numerous and struggle to communicate with one another, opening them up to fraud. He also said that he’d like to see DOGE operatives look at how to cut spending in the Medicare and Medicaid programs
“Washington’s been on a reckless spending spree for way too long,” Perry claimed at the top of the call. “That’s why we have to codify many of the cuts proposed under the Department of Government Efficiency, ensuring that we actually reduce the waste and reign in the federal overreach once and for all. Quite honestly, the waste is simply breathtaking.”

Support for Trump’s Tariffs
Earlier on Wednesday, Trump unveiled his long-promised plan to place tariffs, which will affect more than 100 nations and trading partners.
Asked for his thoughts on the issue, Perry was generally supportive. Though he noted he had not had advanced notice of the details of the tariff plans and was still reviewing them. He also said that he would like to see exemptions for products like coffee and cocoa that generally can not be grown the U.S.
Since Trump promised to announce the sweeping tariffs on Wednesday, U.S. and foreign markets fell. Prices on a broad range of products are also expected to rise, and consumer confidence reached a four-year low.
Yet the hope for tariff supporters is that the move will bolster the consumption of American made products, and incite companies to move manufacturing into the U.S. – instead of importing products produced with cheaper labor elsewhere.
“I know there’s going to be some market adjustments, but I also know that prior to the national income tax, our country was basically funded by tariffs,” Perry said.  
While tariffs were a primary source of income for the United States for decades, they were largely phased out following World War II, the introduction of income tax, and the increase of global trade.

Constituents express fears of cuts to social programs
Multiple people asked Perry about whether there will be cuts to benefit programs like Medicaid and Social Security.
All but one House Republican voted in February on a broad outline of a plan that would cut $2 trillion in federal spending. Perry was quick to point out that the fine points of how that spending will be cut haven’t been worked out.
“That’s what we call the top line, and these are the targets to get to,” Perry said.
Democrats have warned that the only way to make those cuts possible would be by eating into the funding of social programs. But, Perry noted that Senate Republicans were not likely to agree to such large cuts, and that they would ultimately have to compromise. 
The congressman acknowledged that, in order to reduce the deficit, lawmakers will have to take a hard look at these programs.  He expressed optimism that cuts could be made by eliminating alleged fraud.
“There’s fraud and abuse and that and improper payments,” Perry said about Social Security. “We’re finding out that people have abused these systems to the tune of hundreds of millions, and maybe billions and billions, of dollars. We can’t continue down that road. At a minimum, we should make sure that that stuff is stopped, so that the people that have paid in can get out what they’re expecting.”
A recent audit of the Social Security program found billions in improper payments between 2020 and 2023, but those makes up a small fraction — less than 1% — of all payments made by the multi-trillion dollar program. And not all of those overpayments were due to fraud. 
Perry also said he’d be open to making fewer Americans eligible for Medicaid.
“Working adults have become the largest subgroup of Medicaid because of the way it’s been expanded,” Perry said. “The real problem … is that we can’t afford it, because we have just a huge amount of spending where we never had it before … It wasn’t what it was designed for.”
Medicaid was vastly expanded under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Since then, virtually all American citizens who haven’t aged into Medicare, and can’t obtain comparable insurance through an employer or spouse, can get on a federally-funded plan. Though what the government’s share of that cost is depends on a recipient’s income.
“The expanded population is 90% of [what the] federal government is paying, and so it’s actually diverting the resources away from the truly needy people,” Perry said. “We’ve got to take a look at it to make sure that the eligibility requirements are being met for the truly needy”
Another constituent asked about the impact of cuts to the Social Security Administration’s workforce, and whether it would make it more difficult to access services. 
Perry said while people may be experiencing difficulty getting a golf of Social Security employees since workforce cuts to federal agencies, the issue isn’t new. 
“I’m not for cutting the staff if the staff is necessary,” Perry said.  “But we’ve dealt for a long time with Social Security in our office, because people could not get timely answers. And unfortunately for us, that’s not a new circumstance.”
“I don’t know if it’s becoming more acute,” Perry added.

“Activist judges”
Perry was asked by a Trump-supporting constituent what he hoped to do about judges that have blocked some of the administration’s policies from taking effect. That includes his ban on birthright citizenship, his efforts to strip deportation protections from Venezuelans, and blocking federal funding for institutions that provide gender-affirming care for youth.
“We have these activist judges just right and left impeding him every step they go,” the caller said. “Why isn’t funding being pulled?”
Injunctions with nationwide effects ordered by federal judges have drawn the ire of numerous Republicans lawmakers. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), has warned that lawmakers may take action, including defunding or restructuring federal courts.
Perry, however, took a more measured approach. 
“We do control the power of the purse, but I don’t know that there really is any way to single out individual judges,” Perry said. “We would be essentially forced to cut the entire portion of some judiciary and I don’t think that’s probably responsible when there’s one or two bad actors.”
Perry also said he does not believe impeachment is wise. He said it could “bog down” Congress, and would almost certainly fail in the Senate where a two-thirds vote is required. 
But Perry was asked specifically about a resolution introduced by Arizona Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, which contends that judges can be removed with a simple majority vote by taking advantage of a constitutional loophole. 
The Constitution states that judges “shall hold their offices during good behavior,” and Biggs’ resolution argues that Judge James E. Boasberg, who attempted to block Trump from deporting hundreds of alleged gang members to El Salvador, has violated it. Though it would likely face legal challenges, the resolution is an effort to skirt the two-thirds vote requirement of impeachment.
Perry warned against the tact.
“There’s oftentimes activism on both sides,” Perry said. “When Republicans are in the Executive branch, then there might be activists on the Democrat side, and vice versa. So you’ve gotta understand that things cut both ways.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Perry-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 00:01:14.560322

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia House passed a bill Wednesday that seeks to overhaul the compensation process allowing the state to pay wrongfully convicted Georgians, a system that has long relied on individual resolutions to pay people who were locked up and later exonerated.
Republican lawmakers in the state House prevailed in a contentious 244-61 vote after legislators spliced it onto a bill aimed at allowing criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct. 
The original wrongful compensation bill, House Bill 533, stalled in the House on Crossover Day, March 7, passing out of the chamber’s Judiciary Non-Civil Committee but never appearing on the floor for a vote. Previous versions of the bill have faced fierce opposition in the Senate, particularly by Sen. Randy Robertson, a Cataula

Republican and former law enforcement officer who has repeatedly raised questions about the innocence of convicts who he says could be exonerated by the courts on a legal technicality. But attached to Senate Bill 244, which the bill’s lead sponsor Sen. Brandon Beach said is inspired by President Donald Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, it may face a smoother path to success.
The Genesis of the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act
As one of only a few states without a designated statute in place to compensate wrongfully convicted citizens, Georgia’s wrongfully incarcerated residents face an uphill battle when attempting to secure compensation.
That’s on top of the already complex, often yearslong process prisoners must undertake in order to get a conviction overturned. Once they’ve secured their freedom, those who have been wrongfully convicted must then find a state representative who is willing to sponsor an individual compensation resolution for them and file a claim with Georgia’s Claims Advisory Board. For any claims over $5,000 — which encompasses most, if not all wrongful conviction cases — the advisory board will then make a recommendation to the legislature, which apportions compensation funds as part of the annual state budget.
“Certainly, this process is not meant for wrongful conviction,” said Maggie Hasty, who oversees claims for the Secretary of State’s office. “It is meant for people who have monetary claims against state agencies.”
Following the Advisory Board’s recommendations, those resolutions then go through the full legislative process and must pass committees and floor votes in both the House and Senate before they can take effect.

Advocates have criticized the current system, arguing that it results in unequal treatment between exonerees and subjects individual compensation resolutions to legislators’ political whims. But under the language in HB 533, sponsored by Rome Republican Rep. Katie Dempsey, the pathway would be streamlined. The bill would establish a new process under Georgia state law for people who have been exonerated, allowing administrative law judges — rather than the Claims Advisory Board — to rule on wrongful conviction compensation cases. It would also award a standardized rate of $75,000 for each year of incarceration to each exoneree, with an additional $25,000 added for each year spent on death row. 
For Dempsey, who sponsored two individual compensation resolutions for residents of Floyd County in addition to the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act, “a wrongful conviction is unimaginable.” 
“I often put myself in those shoes — because it could happen to any of us, or our children, or someone we love or care about,” she said, adding, “I wouldn’t last ten minutes in prison and you all know that. I would need a lot more than money to make me whole.”
For the five citizens hoping to seek compensation this year, however, time may already have run out. On Crossover Day, lawmakers combined five individual compensation resolutions into House Resolution 128, which passed overwhelmingly in the House but did not receive a hearing on the Senate side until Tuesday, after the deadline to add it to the Senate calendar had passed. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Compensation, which Robertson chairs, began its hearing at 6 a.m. on Tuesday morning, ultimately concluding after more than four hours of testimony without a final vote.
“We rush too many things through this building without having legitimate, deep-dive conversations about it,” Robertson said, comparing the combined bill to a “bastard son.”
Democrats split between aiding wrongfully convicted and President Trump
For House Democrats, who have overwhelmingly supported compensating those who are wrongfully convicted in previous bienniums, the marriage between the wrongful conviction act and a bill aimed at compensating President Donald Trump presented a philosophical dilemma.
According to state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican and staunch Trump ally who was recently appointed by the president to serve as U.S. Treasurer, SB 244 was directly inspired by Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, in which Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was disqualified after an appeals court judge

found that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a “‘significant’ appearance of impropriety.” Under SB 244, attorney’s fees and other costs would come out of county prosecutors’ budgets, which Democrats fear could have a disproportionate impact on smaller counties with more limited budgets, and discourage prosecutors from tackling complex or high-profile cases.
In a scathing Minority Report, state Rep. Shea Roberts, an Atlanta Democrat, condemned the combination of the two pieces of legislation.
“I wanted to believe that we were better than this,” she said. “I held out hope that the majority party in this chamber would not use its legislative power for blatant political retribution. And tacking the Wrongfully Incarcerated Compensation bipartisan bill that our colleagues have worked tirelessly to pass for years onto this punitive SB 244 makes me physically sick.”
The bill would also directly benefit a sitting legislator: Sen. Shawn Still, a Johns Creek Republican, was indicted in the Fulton County election interference case alongside Trump and 17 other codefendants. If the bill passes, he too may be able to recoup the cost of his legal fees.
But state Rep. Scott Holcomb, an Atlanta Democrat who sponsored two previous versions of the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act, urged his colleagues to vote in favor of the bill.

The current compensation process “has been candidly broken for a very, very long time,” he said. “What it leads to is inconsistent results: some people get compensation, some people don’t. Some people get a certain amount of compensation, some people get less, some people get more.”
He also highlighted the repeated issues he’s faced getting the Senate to consider any form of compensation for the wrongfully convicted.
“What’s happened since 2022 is no resolutions have moved, period, in the senate,” he said. “They haven’t entertained them, they haven’t considered them. Last year they didn’t even have hearings for measures that were passed here.”
Though the vast majority of Democrats voted against the bill, Holcomb and Dempsey are optimistic that combining the two bills will improve their chances of establishing change by the end of the 2025 legislative session.
“I don’t like being sideways with the majority of my caucus,” Holcomb said after the bill passed on the House floor. “But at the same token, when all is said and done, and when I leave this building for good, there’s going to be very few things that I’ve worked on that will have been incredibly consequential. This will be one of them, and so I had to continue to support it, and I’ll continue to support it, and I really hope that it gets to the finish line this year.”
The legislation now returns to the Senate, which must agree to the amended House version before the bill can advance to the governor’s desk.

Jim Pillen’s recommendation to cut the program’s state funding.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, through successful 2024 and 2025 legislation, mandated that the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services identify and work with a nonprofit on such a program. The plan has been to partner with Iowa’s SafeNetRx for a first-in-the-nation multi-state prescription drug donation program. Hughes visited the facility in October 2023.

The SafeNetRx program tailors its services to individuals who can’t afford prescribed medication, regardless of insurance status, with an annual household income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level.
Nebraska state senators approved about $530,000 annually for the program in 2024, which hadn’t yet taken off because a federal law took effect last summer, tying up the partnership.
Pillen suggested pulling funding in his January budget recommendations. It was one of many recent programs on the governor’s “last in, first out” suggestions list.
‘Incredibly disappointed’
Lawmakers voted 46-0 on March 6 for a quick fix from Hughes to get around the federal obstacle, clearing the way for DHHS to act. The new state law, Legislative Bill 10, which Pillen approved five days after passage, included language from the Governor’s Office authorizing DHHS to receive and dispense donated medicines or supplies to anyone impacted by a governor-declared state of emergency.
Even with the change, SafeNetRx was left in the wings.
The Legislature’s Appropriations Committee on Wednesday, in a 6-0 vote with three senators not taking a position, voted to pull all funding.
The same lawmakers also reworded the language authorizing the spending, stipulating that DHHS officials “may” identify a nonprofit for the donation program, rather than “shall.” The vote also prohibited DHHS from using any state funds “for the purpose of approving, designating or administering the program.”
Hughes said she was “incredibly disappointed” by the language change on spending.
“I wasn’t aware that this was a discussion going on, and they made that determination, I feel, on some misinformation,” Hughes said after the vote.
Previous widespread support
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, committee vice chair, said she had a lot of questions about the program that remained unanswered. She led the vote to take away funding, joined by State Sens. Rob Clements, Myron Dorn, Loren Lippincott and Paul Strommen, all Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.

State Sens. Ashlei Spivey, Machaela Cavanaugh and Jason Prokop, all Democrats, were “present, not voting.”
All nine committee members supported Hughes’ bill in March. The non-freshman senators supported the 2024 legislation and funding bill, as did the predecessors for freshmen Prokop, Spivey and Strommen.
Armendariz compared the medications program to when she tore down a fence and had someone take her “trash” away for free. She said if SafeNetRx wanted the medications, that was one thing, but she was uncertain what happened with the medications after, how the nonprofit was funded and whether SafeNetRx staff would be recirculating the medications for free.
“If that nonprofit is doing it for free, that’s a different answer from me,” Armendariz said.
Without state funding, Hughes said it is unlikely the Iowa-based program would just return donated medicine to Nebraska. Nebraskans can already donate to the program, which was the status quo before Hughes’ laws. At least one Nebraska pharmacy, in Gretna, was already donating meds.
How the program works
SafeNetRx has multiple inspections to check whether meds are:

Sealed in tamper-evident packaging.
Non-expired.
Non-controlled substances.

Pharmacists also confirm that donated medicines do not require refrigeration and show no signs of tampering or deterioration. To date, according to SafeNetRx, there have been zero patient safety issues.

According to SafeNetRx’s latest annual report, the “drug donation journey” is five steps: donate, process, inspect, connect with local pharmacists and “change lives.” Last fiscal year, 237 long-term care pharmacies, community pharmacies, medical clinics, public health agencies or other donors nationwide gave to the nonprofit, including from Nebraska.
Iowa’s provider network currently includes in-state primary health care clinics, free clinics or charitable pharmacies, community pharmacies, specialty care clinics, behavioral health practices and federally qualified health centers.
If the partnership goes forward, Nebraska pharmacists could be part of the provider network and have access to real-time inventory to secure necessary prescription drugs for low-income patients.
By the end of fiscal year 2024, SafeNetRx had served more than 147,000 patients with medicine they couldn’t otherwise afford, according to the annual report. In total, SafeNetRx has received $126 million in donated medicine that has been collected, inspected and made available through the dispensing network.
Budget deficit impact
Hughes’ legislation sailed through both years with little conversation. Armendariz said she asked questions off the floor, yet some “unknowns” remained.
“I didn’t think that it would be that detrimental. It wasn’t that much money,” Armendariz said of why she voted for the bills each time. “We’re in a different financial situation now.”
  State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The state faces a projected $457 million projected budget deficit, with preliminary cuts proposed by the Appropriations Committee bringing that down to $289 million. 
Cutting Hughes’ program would save just over $1 million in that cycle, while also clawing back all funds from this fiscal year that DHHS didn’t spend, even after the March fix. 
Armendariz, defending her position, said she worked at the Open Door Mission in Omaha and understood the possible impact of people not having meds, pointing to people the organization helped. 
On Hughes’ bill, Armendariz said the “unknowns” led her to think it was “fair game, on the table, to reevaluate whether we wanted to continue it.”
‘Show me the numbers’
SafeNetRx CEO Jon Rosmann, in a phone call just after the vote this year to clear the way for the program, described Hughes’ bill as the “last hurdle.” He said he and his nonprofit were “pretty optimistic” for what could be the first multi-state donation program nationwide. 
SafeNetRx began in 2007 and has grown to be the largest in the nation, with bipartisan support.
Rosmann had said that for every dollar that SafeNetRx received — Iowa lawmakers this year appropriated $600,000 in state dollars — it leads to $20 in donated medicine for patients.
“There’s just not a lot of programs and services that can offer that type of return,” Rosmann said after that vote.

Dr. Joshua Rehmann, a family medicine physician in Des Moines who has been on the SafeNetRx board of directors, said in late March that his patients have benefited from the Iowa program, and he was excited about the prospects of the Cornhusker State joining in.
“The amount of money that saves for the system with hopefully fewer disease complications down the road has a huge impact,” Rehmann said.
Rosmann had said the Nebraska-Iowa partnership could be a “template” for future expansions to other states in a “comprehensive and efficient, safe program.”
SafeNetRx officials did not respond to an afternoon email seeking comment on how the withdrawn funding might impact the planned partnership.
Hughes, defending the value of the program, said it might take a couple of years before savings are fully realized in Nebraska, but she said the alternative is continuing to spend more than $700,000 per year on incinerating unused medications, some of which could go toward patients.
Armendariz said the decision isn’t final, but that she wants to see the numbers if there is really a return on investment. 
“Show me the numbers,” Armendariz said. “Most people in government do not expect to give you an ROI.”
‘Makes no sense’
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former hospital administrator who went to Iowa in October 2023 with Hughes to see the SafeNetRx facility, has repeatedly said the program is worthwhile. He noted that low-income patients might space out pills, cut meds in half or skip taking doses altogether to save money. Some patients, he added, choose between food or medicine.

Riepe said he was disappointed in the vote and said he hopes Hughes continues fighting and said he would be honored to be a cosponsor on a new bill, if needed.
Hughes has described her “easy,” “no-brainer” legislation as her favorite bill in her three years of service. She talked with every committee member after the noon-hour vote. 
Clements said the decision could be reconsidered in the future if the committee reaches a balanced budget and has excess funding.
Riepe and Hughes said they hope funding for the donation program can be restored this year.
“It just makes no sense,” Riepe said. “I’m really disappointed that they didn’t see the merits in it.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature has voted to allow teenagers as young as 18 to serve alcohol in the state.
On Wednesday, the Alaska House of Representatives voted 32-8 to pass Senate Bill 15, which lowers the minimum alcohol-serving age in restaurants, breweries, wineries, distilleries, resorts and similar businesses. The minimum age to serve alcohol at a bar or sell it at a package store remains 21.
A separate provision of the bill requires alcohol-serving businesses to post a sign stating that alcohol causes cancer. Another late-added section also allows members of the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars to attend each other’s social clubs.
The House’s vote follows a 19-0 vote by the Alaska Senate in February and sends the bill back to the Senate for a concurrence vote. That’s typically an uncontroversial act that asks the Senate to agree with minor changes to the bill that were made in the House. 
If the Senate concurs with the House changes, the bill will go to Gov. Mike Dunleavy for final approval.
“I am hopeful for concurrence,” said Sen. Kelly Merrick, R-Eagle River and the bill’s sponsor. 
SB 15 is almost identical to House Bill 189, which passed the Legislature last year. HB 189 was one of five bills vetoed by Dunleavy because they were passed by the House after the legal end of the regular session.
“This one passed literally two minutes after midnight and was vetoed for that reason,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, who carried the bill on the House floor.
Speaking before Wednesday’s vote, Fields called SB 15 a “jobs bill” that will help employers hire for Alaska’s busy summer tourist season.
Rep. Alyse Galvin, I-Anchorage, spoke in favor of the bill. She worked as a waitress while growing up in Anchorage, and as a teenager, she earned half of what her older coworkers did because she couldn’t serve alcohol, she said.
“I was living on my own, paying my own way through college, and I was at Simon and Seafort’s and many of the restaurants that you all are familiar with, and because I couldn’t serve alcohol, I made much less money, and so I think this gives those of us who are trying to make it on their own an opportunity to make money and also get good training and supervision about how to be safe while serving,” she said.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, has advocated the cancer-warning section of the bill for three years and spoke in support of that segment.
“This bill is not telling anyone what they should or shouldn’t do. It’s simply informing Alaskans about a medical fact long established, the simple way to lower your risk of cancer is to choose not to drink alcohol,” he said.
None of the bill’s opponents spoke against the bill before the final vote.
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, voted in favor of the bill last year but was among the eight “no” votes in the House this year.
Vance said that after thinking about the bill over the past few days, she supports the current over-21 drinking age and doesn’t think it makes sense to tell Alaskans that they can serve alcohol but not drink it. 
“It felt like we’re putting a moral juxtaposition for those in that age range, and it’s just not fair,” Vance said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — Prosecutors played a recording Wednesday of a defendant allegedly confessing to the theft of $1.8 million from the state of South Dakota.
“I stole some money,” Lonna Carroll said while audibly crying in the recording.
Meanwhile, her defense attorney continued to say the state was negligent in its oversight and the case is too old to prosecute.
Wednesday was the second day of a trial expected to last three days at the Hughes County Courthouse. The state continued to present its case, after Tuesday’s opening statements and jury selection.

Carroll, a 68-year-old retiree, is charged with two felony counts of grand theft for crimes she allegedly committed from 2010 to 2023 while working as an administrative assistant for the Division of Child Protection Services in the state Department of Social Services. She faces up to 25 years in prison and a $50,000 fine for the first count, and 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine for the second count.
Once a child is placed in the state’s care, Child Protection Services employees can make financial requests on the child’s behalf for items such as school supplies, clothing or a bed. The funds are deposited into a bank account for the child. 
The prosecution alleges Carroll made requests for children that were no longer in the state’s care, approved the requests, deposited checks into accounts for the children at American Bank and Trust in Pierre, and later withdrew the deposited amounts in cash. Carroll allegedly did that 215 times, stealing a total of $1,777,665.73 over the course of 13 years. 
The audio recording played for jurors included state Division of Criminal Investigation agent Charles Swanson walking Carroll through some evidence illustrating her involvement in the case. 
She verbally admitted to depositing checks at American Bank and Trust and withdrawing the funds in cash, and answered yes when asked if the situation spiraled out of control. 
The case is part of a rash of criminal allegations against state employees that state Attorney General Marty Jackley has filed since last year, leading not only to criminal prosecutions but also to a series of administrative and legislative reforms adopted in response.
Evidence shows spending on clothing, big cash deposits
Division of Criminal Investigation agent Matt Glenn led the investigation of Carroll after Department of Social Services staff contacted him on Feb. 26, 2024. A department employee had noticed discrepancies between spreadsheets and the balances in accounts that were managed by Carroll, who by that time had retired and moved to Algona, Iowa.
During Glenn’s testimony, the prosecution presented evidence that Carroll had been spending thousands on clothing. The evidence included photos of storage unit 56 at Capital Storage in Pierre. Carroll’s Wells Fargo bank statements showed she had been paying for the unit. 
The unit was “full of totes and garbage bags full of clothes and other personal items,” Glenn said, including boxes of receipts. 
$1.8 million theft trial begins with details of alleged scheme; defense attacks state negligence

Those receipts showed thousands of dollars spent on clothing, mostly in cash. One receipt showed $1,000 in cash spent at Al’s Oasis in Oacoma on clothing. 
“It was clear she was living outside her means,” Glenn said. 
Eric Grover, who identified as a coworker and friend of Carroll’s, said during his testimony that a local boutique knew her “and they would give her a call when they would get new shipments in.” 
Carroll’s court-appointed attorney Timothy Whalen asked Glenn if the statute of limitations — a time limit on the prosecution of crimes — was considered in his investigation. Glenn replied that “the clock starts” when the crime is first reported.
Whalen has frequently objected to the admittance of evidence during the trial, arguing unsuccessfully that the charges were brought after the statute of limitations expired.
April Pontrelli works in the Attorney General’s Office as an intelligence analyst looking into white collar crimes, typically fraud. She conducted an analysis of Carroll’s personal Wells Fargo bank account, which showed cash deposits from 2010 to 2023 totaling $682,900.30. 
The cash depositing peaked in 2016 when she deposited $79,815.13 — more than three times her annual take-home pay. The analysis showed she spent $48,000 on retail goods that year.
The analysis also showed she was leasing three vehicles by 2020 and had multiple apartments.
Defense questions state oversight
The Department of Social Services was audited while Carroll worked there. The department has an annual budget of $1.8 billion and more than 1,500 full-time positions.
Kelly Mikkelsen with the state Department of Legislative Audit testified that sample batches are used to audit state departments. He said those samples did not necessarily include accounts Carroll allegedly stole from.  
Exhibits showed during his testimony that Carroll made and approved initial requests as low as $1,500 that eventually reached over $27,000. She would then deposit those sums as separate checks into accounts, and withdraw the money soon after.
Legislative Audit’s investigation indicated Carroll’s involvement in the theft of $591,305.20 from 2019 to 2022 alone. Those years were separated out because the transactions included the entire paper trail — from Carroll making and approving requests, to bank statements, slips and receipts for the cash she withdrew.
“Something that should have raised an eyebrow with somebody, wouldn’t you agree?” Whalen said. 
He asked Mikkelsen why internal controls to catch such behavior were not in place.
“I think those were circumvented by Lonna Carroll,” Mikkelsen said. “There’s always another angle. There’s always a way to circumvent them.” 
The prosecution is expected to rest its case Thursday, after which the defense will have a chance to present its case.

Justin Sparks, a Republican from Wildwood, speaks March 24 during debate in the Missouri House. (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)(A Missouri House member violated a state disclosure law by voting on an appropriation that helped his employer, according to a report approved unanimously on Wednesday by the House Ethics Committee.
The committee, made up of five Republicans and five Democrats, was investigating a complaint against state Rep. Justin Sparks, a Republican from Wildwood, related to his employment with the National Law Enforcement Foundation. The committee found “no support for the claims made in the complaint,” the report states, but found Sparks took “one to three votes with an apparent conflict of interest.”
The committee’s inquiry concluded with a “letter of reproval,” the lowest punishment for violations of House ethics rules.
Interviewed by telephone Wednesday evening, Sparks said he was not aware of the ethics committee inquiry and would have liked an opportunity to review the findings before they were made public.
“I just feel like it’s antithetical to our system of government, of due process, to not even tell somebody that you’re being investigated, or that there’s an allegation against you, or that you possibly could have even done more, or even have a chance to defend yourself,” Sparks said. “This is just a way to arbitrarily issue something to attack somebody’s character.”
State Rep. Lane Roberts, a Joplin Republican who chairs the committee, said in a text that he could not comment on the report. 
The committee held two meetings to consider the complaint prior to Wednesday’s meeting to approve the report.
Asked if Sparks was informed of the committee’s inquiry, Robert said that “to the best of my knowledge, he was not.”
Republican candidate for Missouri House speaker draws scrutiny over $6 million earmark

The committee’s rules do not explicitly require the subject of complaint to be told unless the committee decides to move forward with a more formal investigation. All deliberations on complaints are conducted in closed session.
In 2023, when Sparks was a newly elected legislator, he sought an appropriation to create a child care facility serving employees of the St. Louis County Police Department. The budget passed that May with $6 million set aside from Missouri’s allocation of child care funding in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act.
The contract to use the money was awarded to the National Law Enforcement Foundation, which hired Sparks as its regional representative in November 2023, a job he retained until last month.
The Independent reported on Sparks employment with NLEF in January, as Sparks ran unsuccessfully for speaker of the Missouri House.
While Sparks listed the employment on his personal financial disclosure reports filed at the end of 2023 and 2024, he did not “file a written report of a substantial personal or private interest in the appropriation bills with the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives before voting on such legislation,” the ethics committee report states.
When the fiscal year 2024 budget was being finalized in the spring of 2023, Sparks did not work for NLEF. The money, however, was not disbursed until fiscal year 2025, and when Sparks voted for the budget last year, the funding was included as a reappropriation.
Sparks said he was not aware of the law requiring a formal filing about his employment.
“What I could have done was file a conflict of interest form that I did not know existed, and that’s what I could have and would have done if I had known that the money had not been distributed yet,” Sparks said.
So far, $3.7 million of the money has been spent. There is $2.2 million included in a supplemental appropriation bill for the remainder of the current fiscal year, which passed on March 5. Sparks said he voted for the bill after informing NLEF he was resigning.
A knowing violation of the disclosure law cited by the committee is a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 6 months in jail or a fine of up to $1,000 or both.
In the letter, the committee wrote that proper disclosure “would have helped prevent the appearance of a conflict of interest and furthered public transparency of the appropriation process.”
Sparks said he felt he had made the necessary disclosures. And if he was caught not making disclosures he knew were required, he said, he would admit it.
“If there was some kind of something that I did knowingly or intentionally,” Sparks said, “I would own it.”

Jermaine Johnson, D-Columbia, speaks in the South Carolina House Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in opposition to a bill prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. (Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s Republican-controlled House passed a bill prohibiting state agencies, local governments and universities from violating federal discrimination laws with initiatives promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.
The bill also requires private businesses with government contracts to certify they don’t violate federal discrimination laws.
Republicans insist two words inserted into the bill — “illegal discrimination” — mean it does nothing to existing programs operating legally. Their argument was that it’s an anti-DEI bill that cracks down on “radical” mandates and protects “equal treatment under the law” without affecting legal diversity efforts.
Whether that’s true or not, opponents said, it still has a chilling effect across the state.
The legislation, which passed 82-32 along party lines Wednesday, bans all state agencies, public schools and local governments from giving preferential treatment in hiring or enrollment decisions — or, on the flip side discriminating against anyone — based on a person’s race, gender, religion, or other aspects of their identity.
SC anti-DEI bill could impact everything from school cafeterias to university bookstores

It bars government entities from having offices “for the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion” and forbids them from requiring statements from applicants expressing support for these types of efforts.
Before the final vote, a GOP-led amendment also re-inserted a ban on contracting with private companies with so-called DEI programs. That ban was removed during the committee process following testimony on the far-reaching consequences of such a requirement.
Republicans congratulated themselves as being part of the national anti-DEI movement by adopting the legislative framework of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump banning DEI initiatives at the federal level.
Those orders are currently facing legal challenges over their constitutionality.
The legislation passed despite hours of testimony from college students, professors, and K-12 teachers, as well as advocacy organizations representing women, LGBTQ+ people, racial minorities and South Carolinians with disabilities opposing the effort.

“During the debate you heard a lot of inaccuracies. You heard a lot of fear mongering,” Rep. Shannon Erickson, chairwoman of the House Education and Public Works Committee, said Wednesday on the floor.
“The truth of this bill is that it stops illegal discrimination,” the Beaufort Republican added. “If a program is operating legally, without violating anti-discrimination laws, then programs should remain in place.”
She called it a “critical step toward protecting students and educators from political agendas that have no place in our classrooms.”
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association, had a completely different take.
It’s an “intrusion of divisive national politics into the living rooms, meeting rooms, and classrooms of South Carolinians,” she said in a release after the vote. “Moreover, it reflects a troubling and ongoing confusion and misrepresentation regarding the distinction between DEI initiatives and discrimination.”
The problem, said Rep. Jermaine Johnson, is that what constitutes “illegal discrimination” is up to interpretation and has already led universities to self-police and shy away from certain programs out of an abundance of caution.
If passed, the state attorney general would be charged with enforcement.
“So instead of going through that situation, (colleges) say, ‘You know what, let’s just take down the signs at the multicultural center,'” the Columbia Democrat said. “Let’s just go ahead and do this regardless.”
Democrats argued the loss of DEI programs would leave those who face economic or other disadvantages that more often impact minority populations without support to overcome hurdles not encountered by more affluent peers.

“This is no longer the anti-DEI bill to me. This is the anti-opportunity bill,” said Rep. Wendell Jones, D-Piedmont. “You’re closing the door on so many people. We’re going to lose businesses. We’re going to lose talent. We’re going to lose championships. Because those same kids are now looking to ‘blue’ states to try to figure out where can I go to play. … Let me go where they appreciate me.”
After hearing testimony from Black Democrats, who one after another stood to share personal experiences facing racial discrimination, the General Assembly’s lone Black Republican stepped up to make the party’s final argument for passage of the bill.
“I stand before you and say this, DEI is not going to be the force of the future that shapes our doctors, lawyers,” Rep. Harriet Holman. “We need, here in South Carolina, a meritocracy. We need to reward talent, hard work and determination.”

The Ridgeville Republican spoke of her 28 years of service in the U.S. Army, retiring in 2010 as a lieutenant colonel.
“I am not going to allow anyone to measure my success by DEI. It is not based on my identity. It is based on my hard work,” she said. “I hope for a future where we have an environment where our young people rise to success … not because of their color, and because they have earned every bit of it.”
The bill expands on legislation passed by the House last year that applied only to public colleges, banning them from factoring applicants’ political stances into hiring, firing and admission decisions.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Fixing bridges and roads, while funding nursing homes and law enforcement officers took center stage Wednesday on the House floor with the full chamber’s first look at Montana’s big budget bill — a plan that costs $16.6 billion.
Last fall, Gov. Greg Gianforte proposed his budget for the next biennium, and since the beginning of the 2025 Montana Legislature, House subcommittees have combed through the request and put their fingerprints on it.
Wednesday, House Appropriations Chairperson Llew Jones, R-Conrad, and the chairpeople of the subcommittees presented the various sections of House Bill 2 on health, justice, education and natural resources and transportation.
Jones said the budget is the result of a lot of time and work by staff and legislators, and the product before his colleagues generally followed growth in inflation and population.
Given the hours of investment legislators had put into HB 2 the last three months, he urged his fellow representatives to stick with the bill as is and avoid any amendments — either to increase or decrease it.
“It has some discipline and is transparent,” Jones said.
But adopting a budget is job No. 1 for the legislature, and Rep. Bill Mercer, R-Billings, advocating for his own amendment, said legislators shouldn’t just be rubber stamps.
“You’re not a potted plant here. You have to exercise your own judgement as to whether this makes sense,” Mercer said.
The largest chunk of the bill goes to the Department of Public Health and Human Services, or Section B, an estimated 44%, according to a budget overview from the Legislative Fiscal Division.

That’s $7.3 billion for the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years.
Education accounts for $3.5 billion, and transportation and natural resources make up $2.9 billion.
Rep. Mary Caferro, vice chairperson for House Appropriations, said the budget is a statement of legislator values, and she too thanked staff from the Legislative Fiscal Division, “the smartest people in the whole Capitol.”
“The people of Montana deserve a fair budget that makes life more affordable and provides them the freedom that comes from economic security and good health,” said Caferro, D-Helena.
After a full day of review, the House adopted the budget bill on a 60-39 vote.
“Let’s send it onto the Senate and let the work continue,” Jones said.

Transportation and natural resources
Montana’s population is increasing, and the state is feeling effects of both the population growth and tourism, said Rep. Jerry Schillinger, R-Circle.
“It’s affected all of these departments,” said Schillinger, chairperson of Section C.
His committee reviewed Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, and the Department of Livestock.
For example, he said, the state needs to fix bridges, although the number of people needed for the job was debated in an amendment, as was a hunter education course for Montana.
The legislature added 22 people to the Department of Transportation, many to work on bridges, although with money from state and federal fees.
It also added four meat inspectors in the Department of Livestock, one portion of an overall 6.4% increase for the biennium from the 2025 base, or $2.1 million overall.
In an explanation for the meat inspectors, Schillinger said the pandemic brought to light how fragile food systems have become, and those employees will help with safety.
He also said the Department of Environmental Quality has been affected “in a large way” with housing and commercial developments and legal challenges related to permitting.
As a result, he said, nine more people are budgeted to handle the growing caseload for that agency at a cost of $2.3 million for the biennium.
That amount is part of a 7.2% increase for the biennium altogether, or $9.7 million, including $5.4 million for mine reclamation.
All told, Schillinger said his section added 63 positions for a total of 3,973.
On the floor, Mercer tried to cut an engineer and project manager from the Department of Transportation budget, or two positions altogether out of 16, but the amendment failed.

He said everyone is committed to bridges, but he didn’t see the need for the total number of new employees.
“I think that’s excessive,” Mercer said.
But Schillinger and others said the legislature discussed it, a number of bridges are under restrictions, and Montana roads need the resources.
Rep. Marilyn Marler, D-Missoula, pitched a successful amendment to reinsert a hunter education program into the budget, which she argued is a healthy and important part of the state’s culture and heritage.
Marler also said it wasn’t costing taxpayers because the dollars come from hunting licenses and an excise tax on guns and ammunition.
Rep. Shannon Maness, R-Dillon, said it pained him to speak in support of a budget increase, but the money was already allocated for that purpose — and it’s needed.
“This program is suffering,” Maness said of hunter education. “It’s been hampered in recent years.”

Public Safety
The public safety portion of the budget, comprising five agencies, is led by Rep. Fiona Nave, R-Columbus, and is the smallest of the budget sections.
“These dollars really, really have to stretch over things that we are required to do,” Nave said. 
Nave summarized the budgets for the judicial branch, Department of Justice, Office of Public Defender, Department of Corrections and the Public Service Commission, the latter of which receives no general fund money. 
The budget approved in committee gave substantial, 9% raises to highway patrol to address poor retention, which Nave said was one of the biggest issues in state law enforcement. 
“The officers end up moving from agency to agency depending upon who can pay them the most. And unfortunately, the state’s a little bit disadvantaged because of the timing,” Nave said “We end up having to do it first and then all the counties can take a look and say, okay, you know, can I match that.”
Another big ask came from the judiciary, where the courts asked for additional judges in Yellowstone County to handle increased caseload. The committee approved two of the requested three judges, but added a condition requesting the 10 judges in the county to look at having specialized dockets to streamline the process. 
The Department of Corrections saw the largest increase in the budget with a $68 million bump. The biggest chunk of that is nearly $24 million in contracts for out-of-state prison beds — roughly three times what the state originally paid in 2023 to send 120 inmates to Arizona.  
Now, Montana houses 600 male inmates in out-of-state prisons owned by private prison operator CoreCivic, and while the Legislature is considering hundreds of millions of dollars for DOC capital projects, it is unlikely to make much headway in the backlog of inmates in Montana’s penal system. 
Rep. S.J. Howell, D-Missoula, brought an amendment to strip the funding to send inmates out of state, citing concerns over accountability and oversight at private prison facilities, but the House opposed the change, with Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, calling the argument “completely fallacious.”  
Nave said that while she was sympathetic to Howell’s position, the state was “in a crisis” and had no other choice but to pay. 
“There are no places to put these people. If we’re not going to fund this, you can either put bunk beds in places we have now or put them on the streets,” she said. “The money put here in the line item is to pay for the beds we are already utilizing and that we need to pay for. We are obligated.”
Another amendment to increase funding for the Office of Public Defender — which the committee funded below what the department had asked for — also failed. 
But one amendment introduced on the floor did pass. Earlier in the session Speaker Pro Tempore Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, carried a bill to create a railroad safety inspection program within the PSC as a standalone bill, which passed the chamber 98-2 before being tabled in the Appropriations Committee. 
Her budget amendment asked for half the inspection staff the original bill requested, and many lawmakers spoke in support, pointing to recent train derailments in Montana as a need. 
Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka, said he wanted to avoid another scenario like a 2021 Amtrak derailment that killed 3 people and injured more than 50. 
“That’s the event that we want to prevent. If $200,000 will get us there, I’m a yes.”

Health and Human Services
The Department of Public Health and Human Services accounts for nearly half of the entire budget for HB 2, more than $7 billion for the biennium.
Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, served as chairperson for that subcommittee, and she said the good news is that the legislature trimmed the budget slightly from the governor’s proposal.
However, she also said one difficulty is declining federal match dollars for health programs. Gillette said for every 1% decline in federal match, Montana has to pay from $16 million to $17 million.
“That’s going to present some serious future challenges for us,” Gillette said.
  Rep. Jane Gillette rests her laptop on a binder containing Montana’s budget for the next biennium. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)
Caferro said Gillette ran a fair subcommittee, and such leadership is important because many members of the public from all walks of life testify there.
“We see the faces of the people behind all of these decisions and numbers and lines on pieces of paper,” Caferro said.
To Caferro, the agenda represented a “strong agenda for children,” for babies, toddlers and families.
“Children don’t ask what home to be born into, but I believe it’s government’s role to take care of children first and foremost,” Caferro said.
The cost for the biennium is 1.6% lower than the base in 2025, according to the overview from the Legislative Fiscal Division.
Highlights include one-time funding of $79.5 million to operate facilities including the Montana State Hospital, nearly $2 billion for Medicaid expansion, provider rate increases for Medicaid and non-Medicaid providers, and a cut of 80 net positions out of 2,832.
The House considered numerous amendments — to cut and add — and all but one, characterized as a technical adjustment, failed. 
Mercer, a fiscal conservative, proposed numerous amendments to trim the budget, and his proposals failed, but other legislators joked that they would work on softening his heart.
“My heart is plenty soft,” Mercer joked back.

General Government
Rep. Terry Falk, R-Kalispell said much of the work on the general government section of HB 2 was about ensuring “we have good transparency and accountability in state government.”
The committee reviewed the Legislative branch, Consumer Council, Governor’s Office, the Commissioner of Public Practices, the Auditor’s Office, the Department of Revenue, the Department of Administration, the Department of Labor and Industry, and the Department of Military Affairs.
Some of that was seen in the Legislative branch, which received information and technology upgrades, including an additional $229,000 in one-time funding to increase the public’s access to lobbying information.
The State Auditor’s Office also received money for consumer information and fraud prevention. The Department of Military Affairs also saw a boost, with the budget adding $3.8 million to develop 14 new positions.
Rep. Luke Muszkiewicz, D-Helena, said the section was about the people behind the numbers and that state employees are “knowledgeable, conscientious and dedicated public servants who are committed to serving the people of Montana.”
Falk said there was some pushback at times, but called out the tension between the Legislature and the Executive office, saying “it should be there.”
Three amendments were brought, with just one passing from Falk. It eliminated $12.9 million from the general fund, state special revenue, federal special revenue, and proprietary funding that was set to go to the Recruitment and Retention Contingency Fund, the largest cut made to the budget on the floor.
“I think in general, things were restrained,” Falk said. “I would like to have seen us do more.”

Education
Chairman David Bedey, R-Hamilton, highlighted investments the state is making in education. Bedey’s subcommittee reviewed the Office of Public Instruction, the Board of Public Education, the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, the Montana School for the Deaf and Blind, the Montana Arts Council, the Montana State Library and the Montana Historical Society.
The Office of Public Instruction received a 10% increase in funding for the Local Education Activities Program, which involves aid for major maintenance projects, debt service assistance and school lunch funding. The budget also includes an increase in teacher pay, which is contingent on the passage of House Bill 252, which has come to be known as the STARS Act and is a major education proposal this session.
There’s also $640,000 for a study of high schools and $2 million for OPI for database modernization. Several bills — HB 515, HB 551, SB 322 — will have to pass for some appropriations to go through. There’s also money for the agency to add seven new staff.
Bedey also added the committee had made some adjustments and cuts “to align the budget with actual projected spending for the unanticipated significant enrollment appropriation.”
There’s also money to study how AI will be used in classrooms, which will be implemented by the Montana Digital Academy. 
“Its purpose is to get our arms around how AI is going to influence education and the kind of educational materials that we more and more rely upon, like online materials, to support,” Bedey said. “We don’t use books like they did when I was a kid.”
The Montana State Library will also see some increases, mostly for personal services and fixed costs. 
The Montana Historical Society also received an increase — including a one-time appropriation of $1 million to plan for the country’s 250th birthday — as well as half a million for operation of the Montana Historical Society.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/House-1-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-04-02 20:59:18.655807

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)After a long debate Wednesday, the Idaho House passed — on a nearly veto-proof majority — a bill that would ban business, governments and schools from requiring medical interventions. 
House Bill 472 is the House’s revised version of a so-called medical freedom bill that Gov. Brad Little recently vetoed. 
The House’s 40-minute debate Wednesday turned contentious and oftentimes definitional. Bill cosponsor Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend, once refused to answer a question from another lawmaker.

Opening the House’s debate, Beiswenger said the bill “prevents medical force, medical mandates. People can choose them if they want to, but they don’t have to if they don’t want to. You can ask people to leave your place of business. But you can’t force them into medical treatments like vaccines or other kinds of treatments.”
A quarter of the Idaho House’s 70 lawmakers rose to debate the bill, which was evenly split in support and opposition. But the House ultimately passed the bill on a 46-21 vote, with one fewer vote in support than the House’s vote on the original bill, Senate Bill 1023, two weeks ago. (Three House members were absent for Wednesday’s vote. None were absent for the original bill vote.)
Critics’ central concern on the bill was that it would prevent workplaces from refusing service — or entrance of their facilities — to sick people.

 Pressed on if the bill prevents businesses from forcing people to leave, sponsor suggested he believes it wouldn’t

Asked three times if the bill would prevent that by Rep. Dan Garner, R-Clifton, Beiswenger replied by suggesting he believed it would not.

“Can the business ask someone to leave — force someone to leave, if they feel like they are sick?” Garner asked.
“Again, the bill doesn’t address it directly. But I believe a business would be within their rights to ask someone to leave if they are sick,” Beiswenger replied.
Garner didn’t seem convinced. 
“This bill, to me, goes a step too far (in) that it imposes someone’s freedom or rights on their private property or private business,” he said. 
Debating in favor of the bill, Rep. Kyle Harris, R-Lewiston, argued that debate was straying from the bill’s intent.

Debating against the bill, Rep. Ben Fuhriman, R-Shelley, and Rep. Todd Achilles, D-Boise, referenced the bill’s specific language.
“I don’t care what your intentions are. A law is a law,” Fuhriman said. “And it’s written right here on page two, line 29: A business entity doing business in the state of Idaho shall not refuse to provide any service, product, admission to a venue, or transportation to a person — because that person has or has not received or used a medical intervention.”

 Medical mandates include diagnosis or treatment. Ban extends to entry or service refusal. 

After Gov. Little vetoes Idaho ‘medical freedom’ bill, Legislature pursues tweaks

Like the original bill that Little vetoed, two new bills introduced this week in the House and Senate would pursue similarly broad medical mandate bans. 
The bills would ban businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — from requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services.
The bill would’ve also extended to schools in Idaho — private or public — and colleges, universities and trade schools, blocking them from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.
Under the bills, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.” (The House tweaked the bill Wednesday to add a comma between “drug” and “injection.”)
 New bills tweak originals to address governor’s school concerns. But it’s unclear which will succeed. 

The House’s revised bill, House Bill 472, adds language specifying that the bill wouldn’t overrule existing powers of school districts, or school board trustees — as already granted in Idaho law. After passing the House on Wednesday, the bill is headed to the Senate for consideration 
The Senate’s revised bill, Senate Bill 1210, exempts day cares and adds language specifying the school medical mandate ban provision is subject to various other Idaho laws that let school boards block sick students from attending, spell out parental rights, and more.
The Senate amended its version on Wednesday by tweaking the new language related to schools. 
It’s not immediately clear when the Senate will vote on the amended bill, or consider the House’s version. 
To become law, Idaho bills must pass the House and Senate, and avoid the governor’s veto.

Bryan King, R-Green Forest, asks a question during a Dec. 6, 2024 committee meeting about a prison planned for Franklin County. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate on Wednesday rejected for the second day in a row a $750 appropriation bill to support construction of a new 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. 
Opposition to Senate Bill 354 grew Wednesday with three more senators — Republicans Alan Clark, Steve Crowell and Dan Sullivan — joining ten colleagues who voted against the legislation Tuesday.
Proponents of expanding prison capacity, including the governor, argue the new prison is necessary to address overcrowding in county jails. Officials last month set the preliminary cost estimate of the project at $825 million. 
Local officials and residents were caught off guard last October when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the state’s $2.95 million purchase of 815 acres near Charleston for the project. Community members and elected officials have pushed back against the project for months.
Prison appropriation bill stalls in Arkansas Senate

Sen. Bryan King, a Green Forrest Republican who’s been a vocal opponent from the start, on Wednesday referenced costly prison projects in states like Utah, and said building a 3,000-bed penitentiary in the rural western Arkansas county would be fiscally irresponsible.
“These mega prisons are still mega-financial disasters,” he said. “The only winners are going to be the prison building companies out of state that’s going to take millions of our dollars.”
King also criticized the decision to not expand the state’s Calico Rock prison. Former Gov. Asa Hutchinson proposed expanding the facility by roughly 500 beds using surplus funds, and state lawmakers approved $75 million in reserve funds for the project in December 2022. 
That was put on hold when Sanders threw her support behind the Protect Arkansas Act, a 2023 law that, among other things, removes the possibility of parole for the state’s most serious offenders. Inmates serving more of their sentences means more prison space will be needed, which Sen. Justin Boyd, R-Fort Smith, said needs to be addressed.
“In this chamber we voted to create new penalties for Arkansans…so we all want to say we’re tough on crime, but yet then we don’t want to provide the space,” Boyd said. 
The Legislature set aside $330 million in 2023 to support the governor’s prison expansion efforts, but disputes between the executive branch and the Board of Corrections, and among state lawmakers, have delayed the project.
While the process may not have been perfect, state lawmakers need to find a way to fund this effort to protect constituents, Corning Republican Sen. Blake Johnson said.
“I appreciate everybody’s differences, but please let’s try to work together for the safety of Arkansas citizens,” he said. 
Johnson was one of 18 senators who voted in favor of the measure Wednesday, one fewer than Tuesday. Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, voted for the measure Tuesday, but did not vote Wednesday. Sen. Ken Hammer, R-Benton, who did not vote Tuesday, cast an affirmative vote Wednesday. Sullivan supported the measure Tuesday, but voted against it Wednesday.
SB 354 has twice failed in the Senate because appropriation bills require 27 votes to advance out of the upper chamber. There is no restriction on how many times lawmakers can vote on an appropriation bill, but they only have until the end of the session to advance legislation to the governor for final approval. The General Assembly is expected to finish considering bills by April 16.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA bill aimed at banning gender-affirming care for inmates housed in Georgia prisons passed the state House Wednesday 100-2 after nearly all House Democrats walked out on the vote. 
House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley of Columbus characterized the bill as part of a Republican fixation on a small population of transgender Georgians and a waste of time. Friday is the final day of the annual 40-day legislative session.
“This is day 39, day 39 and we don’t have a budget, and many of our members’ bills have not been heard,” Hugley said. “We came here to focus on the opportunity for Georgians to live, learn and earn. And what do we get? Political theater. What do we get? Bills that want to legalize discrimination. What do we get? A whole lot of nothing. And our citizens deserve better than this. They deserve better than this. I’ve been in these halls over 30 years, and I know that we can be better than what we’re seeing today.”
As far as either side can tell, there are five people incarcerated in Georgia attempting to seek gender-affirming care. Gender-affirming care can range from hormone pills to surgeries, and it’s not clear what the five are seeking. Republican lawmakers have said the Georgia Department of Corrections requested the bill. 
The ban on gender-affirming care in Georgia’s prisons is one of five GOP bills focused on transgender Georgians this legislative session, including a pair of dueling measures banning transgender athletes from girls’ sports in K-12 and college that were melded into one proposal that now sits on Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk.

Democrats said the walkout was less about the specific bill before them Wednesday and more about what they called an all-out attack on LGBTQ Georgians. 
“We have so many bills with so little data on the reason why we’re even drafting these bills, and it’s a step that had to be taken,” said Rep. Imani Barnes, a Democrat from Tucker. “There’s too many trans bills. They’re attacking the LGBTQ community for no reason. I’m a part of that community, and it means a lot to me.”
Duluth Democratic Rep. Ruwa Romman called the prison bill “strike three” after the House passed the two bills aimed at eliminating transgender participation in school sports. 
“We have had no bills on raising the minimum wage,” she said. “We have had one bill pass about housing. We have had no bills on Medicaid expansion. I don’t even know what’s going on with the budget. And you’re telling me that we are going to spend more time on another bill to discriminate?” 
The Democrats walked out after Rep. Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat who serves as House minority caucus chair, delivered a searing speech on Republicans’ focus on transgender Georgians and what she called a manufactured crisis. 
“We could be solving and tackling the big problems that we are sent here, this body of 180 members, with the learned speaker, collectively representing the state, solving as best we can the big problems, but yet we waste time,” Miller said in her speech.

Critics of the ban on gender-affirming care in prisons argue it is unconstitutional and will invite legal challenges. 
Republicans blasted the Democrats for walking out instead of staying to debate the merits of the bill and representing their constituents through a vote. Several Republicans could be seen taking photos of the vote board on the wall that showed dozens of Democrats absent. They continued the one-sided debate as a sea of seats were left empty. 
While lawmakers from both parties commonly “take a walk” on hot issues, including on some of the transgender-focused bills this year, a coordinated walkout is rare. Several Democrats walked out during a bitter debate over abortion restrictions in 2019. 
House Majority Leader Chuck Efstration, a Republican from Mulberry, said the Democrats who participated in Wednesday’s walkout should be punished at the ballot box. 
“Rather than support a common sense measure to ensure that Georgia taxpayer dollars don’t fund sex changes for criminal prisoners, Democrats left,” Efstration said. “That’s tantamount to saying they’re not going to represent their district, they’re unwilling to put a vote up on the board. And I think that their actions should be considered accordingly.”
The bill’s author, Cataula Republican Sen. Randy Robertson, framed the issue similarly.
“While I appreciate the fact that we’re not always going to agree on everything that goes on up here, I think we have to have the stamina, the backbone, and the gumption to stay in the fight, to push for those who send us up here, and to never surrender and turn our backs and walk out on our constituents,” Robertson said. 
Not all Democrats participated in the walkout. Three Democratic representatives – Lynn Heffner of Augusta, Tangie Herring of Macon and Dexter Sharper of Valdosta – stayed and voted for the bill. Two others – Albany Democratic Rep. David Sampson and McDonough Democratic Rep. Regina Lewis Ward – voted against it. Those who stayed were applauded by Republican lawmakers. 
“I will be supporting this bill because I support an individual’s choice but I support the people’s decision on whether or not they pay for those elective procedures,” Heffner said. 
Opponents of the bill counter that gender-affirming care encompasses more than surgeries and can be necessary for a person’s wellbeing.

But less than two hours after the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, redrafted those two budgets, the Idaho House of Representatives killed a different budget – House Bill 475, one of the public school budget enhancements.
All the budget back-and-forth is a telling signal of where the Idaho Legislature found itself Wednesday: 87 days into a contentious session where mainstream Republicans and Democrats in the minority are having to fight tooth-and-nail against hardline conservatives to pass budgets.

During a rare afternoon meeting – and its second meeting of the day Wednesday – the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee drafted failed budgets for the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Idaho Transportation Department.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, sets every budget for every state agency and department and then sends those budgets to the full Idaho House of Representatives and Idaho Senate for consideration. 
The Idaho Senate killed earlier versions of both budgets in recent days.
 Finding compromise on Idaho’s budget bills 

The Senate killed an earlier version of the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources budget, Senate Bill 1191, on Friday. Senators then killed an earlier version of the Idaho Transportation Department budget, Senate Bill 1205, on Tuesday.

However, after changes were made both budgets made it through JFAC on Wednesday without incident or serious opposition – signaling that legislators may have reached some sort of compromise that could eventually pave the way for them to pass the remaining unfinished budgets and adjourn the legislative session for the year.
“Our hope is that this will be our last JFAC meeting, unless either the House or the Senate kills something and we might have to come back,” said Sen. Scott Grow, an Eagle Republican who serves as the co-chair of JFAC. 
Some JFAC members themselves even spoke openly of a compromise during Wednesday afternoon’s meeting. 
“I would like to congratulate the committee, because the definition of compromise is when everybody’s unhappy, and I think we achieved that – except for the good chairman (Grow),” said Rep. Steven Miller, R-Fairfield. “We have a different Legislature than we’ve had before. We’ve got a different committee than we’ve had before, and so we’re going to learn how to compromise and learn how to work ourselves through that process and to do it civilly and understand that there’s times that you feel things so passionately about, this is very difficult to let go of that.”
Grow also spoke of negotiation and compromise.
“I always hope we’re trying to do more good than bad, and that’s our objective,” Grow said. “I think we’ve accomplished that as people have negotiated. (There’s) been a lot of back and forth, a lot of strong feelings. But I feel that everybody has acted civilly, respectfully. So we commend the committee for the great work you’ve done and the great attitude in which you’ve done the work.”
 What changed in the rewritten Idaho budgets? 

In the new Idaho Transportation Department budget, JFAC members removed budget intent language that the Idaho Senate objected to Tuesday night when it killed the earlier budget in a  lopsided 3-31 vote. Budget writers also reduced funding for Idaho Transportation Department divisions by $100. 
For the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources budget, JFAC zeroed out a $481,000 request from Gov. Brad Little to create a SPEED Council to expedite the review of permits for large scale projects like mines or energy transmission lines. 
For the second time, JFAC also refused to accept $24.6 million in federal grant funding to provide Home Energy Rebates Program rebates to Idahoans who buy new appliances or increase the efficiency of their home. Idahoans could have accessed a total of $80.1 million in federal funding for the rebates through 2031, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. But once again, JFAC refused. State budget analysts told JFAC members that if Idaho passes up the federal funding, the money will go to other states participating in the program – the money won’t be available to cut taxes or reduce the federal budget deficit.

Rep. James Petzke, R-Meridian, voted for the budget because he said it needs to pass and be finished. But Petzke said he is disappointed by walking away from the funding, and that he hopes Idaho residents speak out against the Legislature for doing so. 
“We’re basically giving up tens of millions of dollars that could have gone into Idaho’s economy,” Petzke said. “And it’s not going to. It’s going to go to other states instead. And that’s extremely disappointing. But it’s where we’re at right now as a body, it seems. And so I hope that people are upset about that and let us know, because I think that this is unfortunate for Idaho’s economy.”
Both the Idaho Department of Labor budget and the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources budgets still need to pass the full Idaho House and Idaho Senate in order to take effect.
Wednesday marked the 87th day of the 2025 legislative session. Legislators already missed their nonbinding target date to adjourn the session for the year March 21. Most Idaho legislative sessions run for about 80-90 days, although there is no requirement to adjourn by a certain date.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — After a week as president of the University of Louisville, Gerry Bradley on Wednesday fielded questions from faculty members about his surprise installment and his plans going forward, including how he will handle a new state ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) on Kentucky’s public campuses. 
Bradley, along with Board of Trustees Chair Diane Medley and Faculty Senate Chair Eugene Mueller, answered questions during the UofL Faculty Senate’s Wednesday meeting about the events leading up to the sudden departure of former President Kim Schatzel. 
Last week, the board named Bradley as president and accepted Schatzel’s resignation in a special-called meeting. By doing so, the board decided to forgo a national search to name the next president. 
“Our journey is not changing at all,” Bradley told the faculty. “The same strong leadership team that’s been in place and has been built over the last several years is still here and we are still aligned and functioning (toward) the same goals.” 
Medley, the board chair, told reporters last week that “the goals” of Schatzel and the board had changed. She further clarified her comment while addressing the faculty representatives. 
“I didn’t mean different policy. It was just a different direction of choices of career, position, etc.,” Medley said. 
She added that the board knew “it was a fairly quick process, but we had multiple meetings. There were several meetings that were as a group with some discussions because we took it so seriously.” 
In recent years, DEI initiatives have been a Republican target. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has amped up anti-DEI pressure on government and educational institutions. Trump has issued executive orders against such programs in the federal government. The U.S. Justice Department has launched investigations into allegations that universities, including the University of Kentucky, have violated civil rights laws by promoting diversity among faculty. Kentucky Republicans passed a law in the state legislature — House Bill 4 — last week to prohibit DEI programs at the state’s public universities.
“We’re going to comply with the law, but there’s a lot of unknowns in there and contradictory language that’s still unclear to a lot of folks because we do not have a regulatory body around House Bill 4,” Bradley said. 
Bradley said UofL would be reviewing the law with all general counsels of Kentucky public universities and the office of Attorney General Russeull Coleman to “determine what exactly are the provisions of this bill and what are the carve outs and where is the crossing the line.”
Bradley was asked if he would have accepted an interim position. He said that would largely be a question for the board, but said from his perspective the university is facing “so many challenges right now,” such as securing government funding, that taking a year or two under an interim president to conduct a presidential search would have put the university at a disadvantage.
Bradley was poised to leave Louisville, having accepted the University of Cincinnati’s offer to become its executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. The day before Bradley was named Louisville president, the University of Cincinnati announced that Bradley had changed his mind and “is pursuing other opportunities.” 
The Redbook, UofL’s governing document, says the board “shall consult with a faculty committee” to appoint a new president, which did not happen because of the lack of search. However, state law says the board has authority to appoint a president. 
Mueller, who represents the faculty on the Board of Trustees, told senators he was aware of “shock and dismay” over the presidential appointment process and he shared those feelings. Mueller, however, did underscore that the board was limited in what it could publicly say about the Schatzel’s departure. 
“I know there’s some sense that my fellow trustees and I are hiding behind the legal requirement that we can’t talk. That is not how I view it all. I view it as shackles. I think it would be much easier for all of us if we could tell everything that happened and explain why we did what we did.” 
Mueller did address some rumors that Schatzel’s departure had to do with supporting or opposing DEI limits from politicians. He said no legislation was discussed during conversations about the change in president. 
Toward the end of the discussion, Marc Murphy, a law professor who is not part of the Faculty Senate, pressed the speakers to give clearer answers about the reasons for Schaztel’s departure, as the situation has gained the attention, not only of the campus but also politicians in Frankfort, including Gov. Andy Beshear, who told reporters he thinks universities should hire presidents through national searches.
“Before we can move forward, we have to have our feet on the ground looking backward,” Murphy said. “No one knows what happened. You haven’t answered a single question about what happened and you’ve relied on the fact that you’re not allowed to.”
Mueller told Murphy he did “wish I could tell you.” 
“You are not the university counsel,” Mueller said. “You’re not the one issuing … legal advice to us.” 
Before being named president, Bradley was UofL’s executive vice president and university provost for three years. He joined UofL as dean of the School of Dentistry in 2016.
Bradley, the 20th president of the university, said he plans to continue following its strategic plan and begin work on the next guiding plan. 
Schatzel was UofL’s president for about two years.

Free.,Social Security commissioner nominee advances to U.S. Senate floor amid DOGE questions,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/social-security-commissioner-nominee-advances-us-senate-floor-amid-doge-questions,,"WASHINGTON — A Senate panel voted Wednesday to send Frank Bisignano’s nomination as Social Security commissioner to the floor, despite allegations from Democrats that he was dishonest in his testimony before the committee about his relationship with Elon Musk’s DOGE cost-cutting operation.The 14-13 party-line vote took place one day later than originally scheduled in an ornate room just steps from the Senate floor, instead of the committee hearing room.Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said Tuesday morning that he supported Bisignano’s commitment to improve customer service and reduce improper payments.Crapo also committed to looking into an anonymous whistleblower letter that was sent to the committee’s Democrats, though he declined to delay the panel’s vote until after that process concluded.“Even though the timing of the anonymous letter suggests a political effort to delay the committee vote on this nominee, my staff have told Sen. Wyden's staff — and we have discussed this just now — we are open to meeting with the author of the letter and keeping the individual anonymous,” Crapo said. “However, any information provided by the individual must be thoroughly vetted, including allowing the nominee the opportunity to respond.”Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, ranking member on the panel, urged Crapo to delay the vote until after a committee investigation, alleging Bisignano was untruthful during his testimony.  “This nominee lied multiple times to every member of this committee, including the bipartisan Finance staff and the nominee's actions and communications with DOGE remain very much at the heart of my objection here,” Wyden said. “My office received an account from a whistleblower about the ways the nominee was deeply involved in and aware of DOGE's activities at the agency.”Wyden said that Bisignano, though not confirmed and with no official role yet at the agency, intervened at the Social Security Administration to ensure that staff from U.S. DOGE Services had “immediate access to Social Security systems.” DOGE, or Department of Government Efficiency, is a temporary Trump administration entity aimed at slashing the federal workforce and spending.Wyden also argued that Bisignano’s history in corporate America wasn’t a good fit for running the Social Security Administration, saying he “has made a career of swooping in, firing workers, selling off pieces of the company and merging with a competitor.”“These practices may be good for shareholders, but they hurt American families,” Wyden said. “So we, Senate Democrats, are not going to stand by idly while Trump's cronies take a sledgehammer to Social Security and deprive seniors of their earned benefits under the false manner of fighting fraud.”Bisignano hearingBisignano, of New Jersey, testified before the committee for nearly three hours in late March, fielding questions on several issues, including overpayments and customer service.He pledged to reduce the 1% overpayment rate significantly and said he could bring down the average wait time for customer service phone calls from about 20 minutes to less than one minute.“If you look at the Social Security website, and you look at the statistics, taking 20-plus minutes to answer the phone is not really acceptable,” Bisignano said during his confirmation hearing. “And that's the reason why only 46% of the phone calls get answered, because people get discouraged and hang up.”Bisignano promised senators he would ensure Americans’ personal information would be kept secure.If confirmed by the full Senate, Bisignano testified he would “ensure that every beneficiary receives their payments on time, that disability claims are processed in the manner they should be.”“So my first actions are going to be to get organized around delivering the services,” Bisignano said. “And I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion.”He also rejected the possibility of privatizing Social Security.“I've never thought about privatizing. It's not a word that anybody's ever talked to me about,” Bisignano said. “And I don't see this institution as anything other than a government agency that gets run to the benefit of the American public.”Bisignano works as chairman of the board and chief executive officer at Fiserv, Inc., which ""enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people and businesses,"" according to its website.

Senate Bill 5708 came at the request of Attorney General Nick Brown’s office and would have prevented social media companies from pushing addictive feeds and sending notification alerts during certain hours to children under age 18. Gov. Bob Ferguson also backed the bill.
It passed the Senate with bipartisan support, with eight Republicans joining Democrats, but failed to receive a hearing in the House Consumer Protection and Business Committee. 
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Noel Frame, ​​D-Seattle, said she knew the bill needed more work, but was disappointed it didn’t receive a public hearing in the House.
“It ​​felt like a pretty abrupt end,” she said, adding that supporters had “already compromised quite a bit” on the bill.
Likewise, Brown said he was disappointed the bill didn’t get a House hearing, calling the proposal a “commonsense” step to improve youth mental health. 
“Compulsive social media use has demonstrably harmful impacts on young people. It’s disappointing not everyone is treating this crisis with the urgency it deserves,” he said.
The bill was also backed by the Washington Children’s Alliance, an advocacy organization, after conversations with educators and health officials raised alarm about how social media can negatively affect children.
Since the pandemic, there’s been an increase in depression and anxiety among children. In a 2023 advisory, the U.S. Surgeon General recommended that policymakers pursue policies to limit children’s access to social media to reduce the risk of harm. 
“The root cause of so much of the depression and anxiety that we see all across the nation for kids is because they all have access to phones and are getting pumped with all of these really harmful feeds that are coming at all hours of the day and night,” said Stephan Blanford, executive director of the Children’s Alliance. 
The lack of federal legislation has led to states taking action to address online safety for children and the behavioral problems it poses. California approved laws along these lines in 2022 and 2024 that industry-backed lawsuits have tied up in court.
Frame’s bill contains similar provisions to the California legislation. However, she said that many of the criticisms around the bill were distractions and that the attorney general was aware of the lawsuits and that the bill was designed to avoid traps seen in other states. 
“​​It’s a complicated bill,” she said, adding it was easy for the tech industry to highlight the flaws the bill initially had.  
Blanford said the Children’s Alliance worked with the attorney general’s office to draft the legislation and ensure it was constitutional and that the bill was designed to address some of the patterns that can leave children addicted to social media feeds. 
“Technology companies have a huge incentive, financial incentive, to addict our children to their products,” Blanford said. 
Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland, the chair of the Consumer Protection and Business Committee, said concerns about the constitutionality of the bill and privacy violations for youth led to her decision not to hear it this session. 
“It felt like it wasn’t ready and that’s what I kept hearing from people,” Walen said. 
Walen rejected suggestions that her decision had to do with Microsoft being located in her district. 
“I work for the people,” Walen said. “The 48th legislative district, that’s who I work for.” 
Instead, Walen said she hoped to explore the issue further and work with technology companies to see how to refine the bill ahead of the next session.  
Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro Wooley, one of the cosponsors, said he supported the intent of the bill but still thinks it needs more work and that lawmakers need to engage further on it with tech companies and wait until the California litigation is resolved. 
Sen. Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond, was the only Democrat who voted against the bill when it passed the Senate. She said Tuesday that regulating technology can be a challenge.
“I actually think it needs to wait a year or wait until some of those other states have resolved it so we have more clear direction on where we need to go,” Dhingra said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/girls-with-phones-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 20:06:30.077384

Terry Rice (left), R-Waldron, asks a question during debate over Senate Bill 536 in the Senate chamber on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate narrowly endorsed the elimination of the Arkansas State Library on Wednesday, but the bill did not receive enough support to go into effect July 1 if it becomes law.
Senate Bill 536 would transfer the authorities, funds, contracts and employees of the agency and its board to the Arkansas Department of Education. The State Library is already under the department’s umbrella but operates independently, and its board disburses state funds to public libraries on a quarterly basis.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, is the bill’s sponsor and has repeatedly promised to dissolve the State Library Board. Sullivan broadened his intention to dissolve the entire State Library last month after he said the board did not satisfy the conditions he gave them for its survival.
Most laws go into effect 90 days after the end of a legislative session, around Aug. 1, but SB 536 had an emergency clause that would have allowed it to go into effect July 1. This provision was one of many aspects of the bill that library directors opposed Tuesday before it passed the Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs.
Misty Hawkins, regional director of the Arkansas River Valley Regional Library System, said it would be impossible to rework the interlocal agreements in the four counties she serves within three months to account for the language of SB 536. Several library systems in Arkansas encompass multiple counties.
Emergency clauses need the support of two-thirds of lawmakers, which is 24 votes in the Senate. SB 536 instead received 18 votes, the minimum for a simple majority.
Republican Sens. Breanne Davis of Russellville and Bryan King of Green Forest joined five of the six Senate Democrats in voting against the bill. Sen. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, and Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, were absent. Three Republicans voted present and five did not vote.
The Senate subsequently approved a clincher motion from Sullivan with a voice vote. A clincher prevents a bill from receiving another vote in the applicable chamber, so the House will consider SB 536 without its emergency clause.

Bill to abolish Arkansas State Library and its board advances despite librarians’ opposition


Hawkins and three other library directors said Tuesday that SB 536 might cost them the state funding they need to operate their libraries. The bill’s criteria for receiving state funds include “prohibit[ing] access to age-inappropriate materials to a person who is sixteen (16) years old or younger.”
One-room libraries do not have segregated spaces to ensure that children under 16 cannot access specific material, and SB 536 says the Department of Education “may” disburse funds to libraries that meet the proposed criteria but does not mandate it, the library directors said. Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, repeated these concerns on the Senate floor Wednesday.
SB 536 defines “age-inappropriate material” as “books, media, or any other material accessible at a public library containing images or explicit and detailed descriptions” of sexual acts, sexual contact and human genitalia.
The State Library Board approved a motion at a special meeting March 13 to create “non-binding policies to protect children” while honoring First Amendment freedoms and libraries’ material selection policies. Sullivan had asked the board to pass a motion to protect children in libraries and to detach from the American Library Association; the board rejected two separate motions to these ends.
Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, said he also asked State Library Board members to ensure that libraries keep inappropriate content away from children.
“It’s time for drastic things to happen if this incompetent bunch is going to continue to put our children at risk,” Rice said. “There’s going to be fallout, but we’ll fix the fallout.”
Tucker said the Legislature has the authority to reconstitute the State Library Board instead of dissolving it and its parent agency if lawmakers are dissatisfied with its actions or inactions.
Library directors and State Library Board members have repeatedly said, including at Tuesday’s committee meeting, that libraries already organize books on shelves in an age-appropriate manner in accordance with existing standards.
The location and availability of books based on “appropriateness” for minors was the thrust of Act 372 of 2023, also sponsored by Sullivan. The law would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene” and made librarians legally liable for disseminating such materials.
A federal judge temporarily and later permanently blocked portions of Act 372; Attorney General Tim Griffin appealed the ruling in January.

(Forbes Law Offices | Courtesy photo)In the wake of a child sexual and physical abuse scandal at a West Virginia boarding school, the Senate and House of Delegates have been considering two very different pieces of legislation.
A Senate bill, backed by heiress and actress Paris Hilton, sought to prevent child abuse by regulating in-state residential programs and some outdoor programs that often serve children with behavioral issues. 
In the House, a bill would have reduced the timeframe that a civil suit brought by a victim of child sexual assault or abuse could be filed against the state’s insurance program, the Board of Risk and Insurance Management, known as BRIM. 
Miracle Meadows in Salem closed in 2014, and dozens of former students who say they were subjected to horrific abuse began coming forward in 2017, and some civil cases are ongoing. The state could be on the hook for $100 million in settlements paid out by BRIM.
Both bills are unlikely to become law after not going up for a vote in their respective chambers on Wednesday’s Crossover Day deadline.
  Sen. Mike Stuart, R-Kanawha
Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Mike Stuart, who parked Senate Bill 817 — the Paris Hilton bill — in his committee, said the legislation needed more work that couldn’t be completed by the legislative session deadline. 
While the measure would have exempted religious programs from regulation, Stuart said concerns from leaders of religious-based programs about “unintended consequences” had stalled the bill. 
“There were some drawbacks that would have taken a lot of time in committee, especially up against the demands of deadlines,” he said. “It was just more a victim of time than anything [else].”
The bill would require state licensure for private adolescent residential programs and some outdoor or boot camp experience. It also banned the use of physical discipline in these programs and mandated that children have regular, unsupervised video communication with their parents. 
Hilton, who says she was abused in residential treatment facilities as a teen, urged state senators to pass the bill, saying it would establish “essential protections” for children. 
  Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
Bill sponsor Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio, said the bill would close “a hole” in current state law, citing widespread abuse at Miracle Meadows. One lawsuit against the facility on behalf of child victims, which was settled for $50 million, said the children experienced routine beatings and at times were not given toilet paper, requiring them to remain in their own filth.
“Our children have to be protected, and this is one way to protect them,” she said. “This is such a common sense bill.”
West Virginia Watch recently reported that the state has spent $70 million on housing foster children in out-of-state facilities. Chapman said the bill could encourage “good actors” to set up well-regulated, in-state programs to help children with behavioral issues who are now forced out of state. 
“We do need help, and we need to stop shipping our children in crisis out of state,” she said. 
Stuart, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as general counsel for the federal health department, said he’d like to see the bill workshopped during interim meetings ahead of the next year’s legislative session.
“I’m interested in whatever we can do to fix the system,” Stuart said. 
House pauses controversial bill involving child sex abuse victims 
  House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay
In the House, a bill sponsored by Speaker Roger Hanshaw would have reduced the window for child victims whose abusers were covered by state insurance to seek relief in civil suits. 
The measure, House Bill 3516, originated in the House Judiciary Committee late last week, raising concerns from House Democrats that the controversial bill had skipped the typical process of how legislation is introduced in the House. 
House leadership decided on Wednesday morning to move the bill to its inactive calendar without explanation. Some members said there wasn’t consensus among Republicans, who hold a super majority in the House, on the measure. 
Hanshaw, R-Clay, said the state has been assessing what types of liabilities BRIM should cover. The lengths of some statutes of limitations — the window when claims can be brought — have caused BRIM rates to rise for entities using the insurance program, including county boards of education and cities. 
The multi-million dollar payouts for Miracle Meadows will be one of the largest liabilities BRIM has had to cover in the last couple of years, Hanshaw said. 
“In consultation with BRIM, we decided it makes sense to start the conversation about just how long we should leave open statutes of limitations on various kinds of claims. This bill is one of them, to make it sound like it’s more than it is. Is, frankly, pretty irresponsible,” Hanshaw said on Monday. 
Current law allows a child victim of sexual abuse and assault 18 years after reaching age 18 to bring a civil claim; the bill would give victims two years after reaching age 18 to file a civil claim if it was against an entity covered by BRIM.
  Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio
“This legislation is a devastating blow to victims of childhood sexual abuse. We know how difficult it is for survivors to come forward, and how long it can take to process that trauma,” said Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio in a news release.
The state Democratic Party called the measure a “dangerous and callous attempt to roll back legal protections for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.”
“The timing of this bill is especially egregious in light of the tragedy that was exposed less than two years ago at the Miracle Meadows Boarding School for troubled youth in Salem, West Virginia,” the group said Tuesday in a news release. Thirty-two victims have come forward with abuse allegations against Miracle Meadows. 
Hanshaw said there had been a mischaracterization of what the bill was intended to do.
The bill was not “intended to make life easier for the perpetrators of sexual violence,” he emphasized. There would be no changes to criminal claims or proceedings under the legislation.
“We will punish the perpetrators of horrific violence under the criminal laws of the state of West Virginia, exactly like we always would have,” Hanshaw said.

Josh Shapiro signed an executive order last month to attract federal employees to work for the state.  “The whole intent is that [&#8230;]","Protesters rally outside of the Theodore Roosevelt Federal Building headquarters of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Feb. 5, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)At least 700 former federal workers have applied for Pennsylvania government jobs following massive reductions in the U.S. government workforce by the Trump administration, according to a public employee union leader.
Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro signed an executive order last month to attract federal employees to work for the state. 
“The whole intent is that federal workers, or anyone with federal government experience can … get a quick idea of how the application hiring process works in state government, and then see where their experience will help them fit with us,” Miranda Martin, director of talent management for the Office of Administration, said.
The office has directed social media and other digital advertising to federal workers and created a landing page on the state employment website where they can learn about the application process, benefits and see highlighted positions in specialized, hard-to-fill roles, Martin said.
Martin and Philip Glover, national vice president for District 3 of the American Federation of Government Employees, testified about the impacts of unprecedented federal job cuts in a hearing before the House Democratic Policy Committee. AFGE represents about 31,000 federal employees in Pennsylvania.
Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Government Efficiency headed by tech billionaire and Republican megadonor Elon Musk, has indiscriminately fired more than 120,000 workers in massive downsizing and dismantling of federal agencies, CNN reported, citing federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Managment and other news organizations. The layoffs are part of an initiative to cut government spending President Donald Trump initiated on his inauguration day, creating the department by executive order and appointing Musk to lead it.
“I’ve been through six administrations … and I can only say that I have never, ever seen the onslaught against workers, against the union and, frankly, against the services that we provide to the American public,” Glover said.
Pennsylvania has been hit hard and will continue to see impacts of federal downsizing, Glover said. The Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense are all major Pennsylvania employers.
The Trump administration also has eliminated union protection for hundreds of thousands of workers, which unions are fighting, Glover said.
In addition to helping fired federal workers find state jobs, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry has activated its rapid response program to assist workers in applying for unemployment benefits. More than 500 members of the AFGE have applied, Glover said, noting that as the unions have sued to challenge layoffs some workers have been placed back on the federal payroll.
Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D-Philadelphia) asked whether the federal workers who remain in agencies like the Social Security Administration and Veterans Administration would be able to continue to deliver services to people who rely on them.
Glover said programs and workers are being eliminated without regard for the void they will leave.
“They are getting rid of grant programs, willy-nilly, like without any concept of what those programs do for the states, our people are in chaos,” he said.
Using the VA as an example, Glover said veterans who returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with missing limbs will still require prosthetics that the agency may not be able to provide.
“The crux of this is that Pennsylvania, in my mind, is either going to have to pick up these services in some way, which is going to affect your budgets, or those services are just going to not be there for the public,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/federalworkers_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 20:06:30.077384

The bill by Pinellas County Republican Berny Jacques (HB 903) addresses a variety of issues involving inmates in Florida’s corrections system, including what happens if acquisition of the drugs needed to put inmates to death becomes “impossible or impractical.” (Some manufacturers have stopped supplying these drugs for executions.)
The state would use by any method not considered unconstitutional.
The bill would require inmates to exhaust all internal administrative remedies before they could sue over conditions. They’d have to show they’d suffered a physical injury or sexual act to bring claims alleging mental or emotional injuries.
Additionally, the bill extends the period for which a court may authorize an inmate to be involuntarily treated from 90 days to six months.
And it exempts from criminal prosecution a prison or jail employee who installs a tracking device on an inmate. The Phoenix reported last year that inmates in at least one correctional institution were required to wear electronic bracelets to monitor their movements.
During a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, the measure drew criticism from Broward County Democratic Rep. Mike Gottlieb, who objected to language requiring adjudication of indigent inmates’ claims for damages over a negligent or wrongful act or omission to be completed in just one year.
Gottlieb questioned what would happen if the administrative process took longer than a year. “How does that person not lose their ability to sue under this statute?” he asked.
Jacques responded that it was “highly unlikely” the process would take as long as a year. The committee rejected Gottlieb’s subsequent amendment that would have “tolled” or suspended that one-year time limit.
Gottlieb later said he had to vote no on the measure, saying he couldn’t support provisions like placing liens on prisoners who initiate challenges to prison disciplinary reports and the different methods of execution provision.
Orange County Democratic Rep. Johanna López also objected to the execution language.
Jacques replied that the provision would simply allow the state to continue to carry out other constitutionally allowed forms of execution if for whatever reason lethal injection could not be applied.
The measure passed 16-5, along party lines. A companion bill (SB 1604) sponsored by Lee County Republican Jonathan Martin has two more committees to move through before reaching the floor.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)A bill that would require local school boards to adopt policies on extending academic credit for “religious instruction” outside the classroom failed an Alabama House committee on Wednesday.
The House Education Policy Committee rejected HB 342, sponsored by Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, on a 4-9 vote despite significant amendments to the bill that gave local school boards more flexibility with the policy. 
Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, the chair of the committee, said she supported the amendments but said the pushback from both sides was stronger than she expected.

“I had every superintendent around me actually reach out and ask not to,” Collins said in an interview about her vote. “There was just a lot of passion. The amount of people pushing both ways was extreme, more so than I thought, and that makes me hesitant.”
State law currently allows boards of education to extend that credit, but does not mandate released time religious instruction (RTRI), the subject of DuBose’s bill, in which students can take time out of the school day for religious instruction.

The ministry teaches students about the Christian Standard Bible “with a focus on head, heart and hands,” according to its website. In a sample curriculum, it alters the language and organization of Bible lessons so that children can understand it easily. 
Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, also voted against the bill, saying schools can already create religious release time policies. The Legislature passed a law allowing school boards to create a policy in 2019.
“I think the local authorities need to make that decision,” Baker said in an interview. “If they want that there in their system, then they can handle it.”
Collins said she wanted to see more results of the current law. 
“My thought is, we passed it several years ago as a ‘may.’ I would like to see how that works a little bit longer,” she said. 
Rep. Tashina Morris, D-Montgomery, said the program would take away needed instructional time.
“The school hours haven’t changed, but we keep sticking things into the class time,” she said.
DuBose said the bill may come back next year, but start in the Senate.
“People had a difference of opinion. And that happens all the time,” DuBose said in an interview. “I don’t think anything went wrong.”
SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, is identical to DuBose’s bill with the amendments. It was filed Tuesday and is in the Senate Education Policy Committee.

[&#8230;]","Traffic on Interstate 5 near Olympia. (Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Lawmakers in the Washington House and Senate will have plenty of negotiating to do as they try to reconcile competing transportation budget proposals, which both depend on gas tax hikes.
The state House approved its $15.2 billion plan Wednesday, setting the stage for the talks. The legislation differs from the Senate version in significant ways.
First, the Senate’s budget is over $1 billion bigger. 
Second, the Senate has shifted a chunk of spending tied to removing barriers to fish passage out of its purview and over to the capital budget. The House includes nearly $1.2 billion in the next two-year budget to deal with these culverts. The Senate maneuver halves the potential $8 billion shortfall over the next six years. 
And third, while both proposals rely on tax and fee hikes, the mix in each differs.  
The Senate’s plan includes a 6-cent increase in the state’s current 49.4-cent gas tax, with 2% increases each year after to account for inflation. 
The House goes further, looking to raise the state tax 9 cents, and then index it to inflation.
Both hikes would take effect July 1. The Senate gas tax proposal would raise $1.5 billion over the next six years, lawmakers say. The House: $1.8 billion. 
The gas tax increases are not the only ideas in the House and Senate to raise revenue for transportation. 
In the House, the options include a new highway use fee based on fuel efficiency and an increase in the vehicle sales tax. And in the Senate, they include a hike in electric vehicle fees, a new tax on luxury vehicles costing more than $500,000 and a fee for operators of venues with large-scale events. 
The Senate’s revenue package would bring in $3 billion over the next six years. The House’s would raise about $4.4 billion. About $1 billion of that House revenue would be available for the 2025-2027 biennium.
That money would help pay for infrastructure for cars, ferries, bikes and pedestrians. That includes $1.9 billion for ferry operations and capital projects, $900 million for highway preservation and over $300 million for rail and port improvements.
The Senate passed its more than $16 billion transportation budget, as well as its bevy of revenue proposals, over the weekend with some Republican support. The House didn’t act on its tax bill, only passing the budget it would help fund.
The House approved its budget on a 66-30 vote, with a handful of Republican yes votes and a few Democratic dissents.
“The House can look at this proposal and know that this is fiscally conservative,” said Rep. Andrew Barkis, the top Republican on the House Transportation Committee. “This is the proper fiscal approach. This is looking at work within our means, first and foremost.”
Skyrocketing construction costs and slowing gas tax collections have left lawmakers searching for new options for years. They now face a $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget. Without new state revenue, they warn of road projects sitting half-built.
Even with more money, the House budget would still punt on $1.3 billion worth of projects between 2025 and 2031. That’s meant tough conversations with some legislators who are unhappy work in their districts won’t get done anytime soon.
“They understand that sometimes you don’t get what you want when you want it, but you have to persist and there will be a payoff at one point in time for being patient,” said Rep. Jake Fey, a Democrat from Tacoma who chairs the House Transportation Committee.
The Senate plan also includes 13 unpaid days in the next fiscal year for state transportation workers, with some exceptions. The House proposal doesn’t use furloughs to save money.
On the House floor Wednesday, lawmakers added a $350 million reserve fund to cover sudden increases in costs for highway maintenance and ferry replacements.
The legislative session is scheduled to end April 27.
“This is a balanced approach,” Fey said. “I’m looking forward to what happens in the future this legislative session, and there’s going to be a lot of hard work.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Interstate-5-Traffic-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-02 19:04:19.080598

They were led by two students carrying a rainbow-colored coffin. It sat on a table surrounded by electric candles while people spoke about their experiences at the LGBTQIA+ Center for Student Success, known as The Center, and what it meant to them and other members of the LGBTQ+ community to have access to a place where they felt able to be themselves with people who understood them.

The protest and funeral for The Center was held outside of Parks Library to mourn what students called a safe space on campus, which was restructured to comply with legislation passed last year barring state universities from opening or maintaining DEI offices not required by law or for accreditation.
ISU students and supporters protested the changes before they were implemented, and those who gathered Wednesday honored the lost space said its spirit lives on in those who continue to build up their community and fight for visibility.

Arthur Taylor, a senior studying graphic design at ISU, said without his family backing him and the friends he made through The Center, he’s unsure if he would be here today. That, he said, is why the community created by The Center is so important.
“If I had not come to visit The Center my second semester, I don’t know what I would have done,” Taylor said.
Taylor’s sentiments were shared by a number of others who chose to speak about their time at The Center, whether they utilized it for years or found it just a semester before its restructure. While the physical space is still there and rainbows are still hung on its walls, students said it’s not the same with the name changed and the feeling they got that the university, Iowa Board of Regents and state government is trying to hide their presence on campus.
ISU student Silvera Dudenhoefer said beyond The Center acting as a safe and supportive space for those who needed it, the name made clear that the LGBTQ+ community was to be recognized and respected on campus despite the wishes of some.
“In taking the LGBTQ out of the LGBTQ Center, the Board of Regents and ISU administration has shown us exactly who they’re willing to push to the side in an effort to comply,” Dudenhoefer said.
Members of the queer community deserve to have the freedom to be themselves, Dudenhoefer said, especially in a country that touts personal freedom as a tenet of society. If someone doesn’t conform to the way those in power believe they should be, it’s seemingly acceptable to push them aside so no one has to see them.

“We refuse to stop existing, to stop taking up space and to stop living as we were meant to live — proudly, boldly, openly and queerly,” Dudenhoefer said.
Joining the crowd in its protest was Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, who said in comments later echoed in a subcommittee meeting Wednesday afternoon that students must learn about America’s history with the civil rights movement, women’s suffrage and more to examine their causes and how progress was achieved in order to solve the problems of today.
While The Center is lost, Quirmbach said the community it housed is not, and it has grown stronger from these struggles and will win its fight.
“Each and every one of us is part of this rainbow on this coffin,” Quirmbach said. “Each and every one of us has a place here. Each and every one of us has an obligation to stand up for the rights of every person.”

The New Mexico Health Care Authority said in a news release the collaborative is “designed to improve mental health services, reduce disparities and strengthen access to behavioral health across communities.”
Lessons learned from the initiative by New Mexico officials will “help promote and support community engagement, identify and address barriers preventing meaningful participation.”
State lawmakers put a focus on behavioral health treatment during the first half of New Mexico’s legislative session that ended March 22, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed two pieces of legislation into law that will create a “behavioral health executive committee” to coordinate treatment statewide by assessing local needs and make it easier for providers to pay for treatment using Medicaid.
Under the new law, the HCA is responsible for administering the funding that will pay for behavioral health programs. Source NM has a pending inquiry to the HCA if the new collaborative will connect with the agency’s responsibilities under the new law. 
The collaborative is being organized by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the federal agency devoted to addressing addiction and mental health issues which oversees the 988 Lifeline and conducts the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
Only 34.8% of people in New Mexico with private insurance were able to get mental health care in 2021, along with about half of people on Medicaid, according to a review of data collected by SAMHSA.
SAMHSA is among the federal agencies that is facing mass layoffs and cutting grants to states as part of the Trump administration’s “realigning” of the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
Nick Boukas, director of Health Care Authority’s Behavioral Health Services Division, said in the news release that improving behavioral health systems starts with listening to communities.
“By engaging our staff in opportunities like this, we create solutions that are not only effective but rooted in the realities and needs of the people we serve,” Boukas said in a statement.

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Getty Images)Dauphin County Board Chairman Justin Douglas says the Trump administration Wednesday should end the deportation of Bhutanese residents. 
Since President Donald Trump took office, Dauphin County officials say as many as 18 Bhutanese residents who legally immigrated to the U.S. as refugees may have been deported back to the country where many fled ethnic cleansing. Alyson Wert, a spokesperson for Douglas, said three lived in the county.
“We owe it to these individuals and to the promise we’ve made as a nation committed to protecting the vulnerable,” Douglas said at a Dauphin County Commission meeting on Wednesday. “We have a moral and legal obligation not to return refugees to a country that once ethnically cleansed them. …  Some may say this is political, but for me it’s about people. It’s about my constituents. “
As of April 1, at least four of the deportees appear to have been arrested in Nepal while attempting to contact family members in refugee camps there. Fourteen were unaccounted for, at this point. Douglas said at least nine other Bhutanese Pennsylvanians have been detained.
Central Pennsylvania is home to the largest population of Bhutanese Nepali refugees in the country. In the last decades, tens of thousands of them were welcomed into the U.S. as refugees following ethnic cleansing of Nepalese-speaking minorities in Bhutan. Many settled around Harrisburg which has a Bhutanese Nepali population estimated in the tens of thousands.
All of the Bhutanese residents detained or deported by ICE appear to be men, and at least some had criminal charges that Douglas and family members describe as “minor.” 
He said the impact of the arrests has reverberated across the Bhutanese community.
“The community right now is living in uncertainty, unsure of who might be targeted next,” Douglas said. “Yes, these individuals may have minor criminal histories, which enabled ICE to attempt to remove them from the United States. But that is no reason to rip them away from their wives, children, brothers, sisters and community.”
The detentions have caught the attention of Pennsylvania lawmakers at both the state and federal level.
Democratic state lawmakers representing  Dauphin County in Harrisburg have spoken out against the arrests. On March 29, U.S. Congressman Scott Perry (R-Dauphin), a supporter of Trump’s hardline immigration policies generally, said on social media  that he met with Bhutanese community members in Harrisburg.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) In a dramatic but ultimately symbolic show of defiance, Virginia House Democrats on Wednesday tried — and failed — to override 13 of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s vetoes from this year’s legislative session, knowing full well the numbers were never in their favor. 
Youngkin, a Republican, rejected 157 of the 915 measures sent to his desk by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly in February, flexing his veto pen more aggressively than any Virginia governor in decades. 
But with Democrats holding only narrow majorities — 51-49 in the House and 21-19 in the Senate — their chances of reversing any of those decisions were always slim. Overriding a gubernatorial veto in Virginia requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers.
Still, Wednesday’s veto session was less about math and more about momentum in a pivotal election year. With every seat in the House of Delegates on the ballot and a gubernatorial race already underway, Democrats used the day to draw sharp contrasts with the Republican agenda — and with the party’s standard bearer, President Donald Trump.
Nearly every Democratic lawmaker who rose to speak did so with a common refrain, casting House Republicans as “terrified of Trump” and unwilling to stand up for Virginia values — from voting rights and gun safety to fair wages and union rights. 
 Bid to ban assault-style weapons falls short

While the Senate declined to take up any of the vetoed bills, House Democrats fell short in their attempt to override Youngkin’s veto of a bill restricting assault-style firearms. The 50-46 party-line vote was a setback for legislation central to Virginia’s ongoing gun debate.
House Bill 1607, identical to Senate Bill 1181, would have made it a Class 1 misdemeanor to import, sell, or transfer assault-style firearms, with exceptions for antiques, inoperable or manually operated guns, and those made before July 1, 2025. It also barred those under 21 from possessing such firearms and banned high-capacity magazines.
Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, a combat veteran and the bill’s sponsor, defended it as a public safety measure.
“These weapons were designed for the battlefield, not for our streets,” Helmer said. “They have no place in Virginia. Our law enforcement officers work tirelessly to keep our community safe … The least we can do is to support them.”
He accused GOP lawmakers of bowing to special interests: “Once again, the Republicans’ priorities are not the priorities of Virginia’s working families. They are too terrified of Donald Trump to act to remove weapons of war from our communities.”
Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, also a veteran, pushed back, saying the bill would punish law-abiding citizens.
“I also carried weapons overseas in combat situations, and I don’t recall once when I was either conducting combat operations (or) any part in the oath I swore to the Constitution to then be able to come back, sit in this legislature and deprive American citizens of their constitutionally protected rights to defend themselves.”
 Protecting voting rights

The House also came up short in an effort to override Youngkin’s veto of HB 1657, a bill that would have required the Department of Elections to complete any large-scale voter roll removals at least 90 days before any primary or general election — a safeguard currently in place only for federal races.
Mirroring SB 813, the measure permitted removals in cases of death, felony conviction, mental incapacity, or at the voter’s request — all allowed under current law. It also would have extended the time registrars have to process cancellations from 30 to 60 days and doubled the response window for voters flagged over citizenship concerns from 14 to 28 days.
“The right to vote is sacred as the cornerstone of our democracy and the foundations of our commonwealth,” said Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, the bill’s sponsor. “To have a person’s voting rights stripped away so close to an election is simply something that you cannot fathom.”
Henson added, “Let me be clear, if you are ineligible to vote, you simply cannot vote, but it is also the law that voters cannot be systematically purged at the whim of the governor. Yet time and time and time again, Republicans have shown that they’re too scared of Donald Trump to stand up for our democracy and too afraid to protect the right to vote.”
A similar fate befell HB 2002, which sought to limit local registrars to canceling voter registrations only based on data from the Department of Elections or approved state agencies — unless a voter submitted a written request to cancel their own registration.
The bill also aimed to reinstate protections for active-duty military members, Americans temporarily overseas and their families, ensuring their registrations couldn’t be canceled while they remained eligible.
“In Virginia we believe in fair, secure, and accessible elections,” said Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albemarle, the bill’s sponsor. “We have a duty to ensure that our elections are secure without undermining the fundamental right to vote, and we cannot allow outside influences or partisan games to threaten that sacred right.”
 Minimum wage hike fails

An attempt by House Democrats to override Youngkin’s veto of a proposed minimum wage increase also fell short.
HB 1928, sponsored by Del. Jeion Ward, D-Hampton, outlined a phased wage hike — codifying the already-scheduled increase to $12.41 per hour on Jan. 1, 2025, followed by raises to $13.50 in 2026 and $15.00 by 2027.
Ward framed the legislation as essential to working families. “Raising a minimum wage is about people, it’s about families struggling to keep lights on,” she said. “It’s about parents working double shifts to afford childcare. And it’s about the workers who keep Virginia running, but they are still left behind.”
But Republicans pushed back, arguing the bill would backfire on the very people it intended to help.
“What your bill actually does is make it illegal to hire someone at a certain amount,” Freitas said. “There’s no such thing as just one minimum wage, there is always two. There is the arbitrary wage that you set, and then there is $0. And a lot of people are going to end up getting $0.”
He warned that higher wage mandates could eliminate jobs altogether: “You don’t just lift people up to a higher wage.”
 Marijuana justice efforts stalls

Another proposal — HB 2555 — which would have offered sentencing relief for individuals convicted of marijuana-related felonies, also failed to clear the hurdle of a veto override.
The bill would have granted automatic hearings to those still incarcerated or under supervision as of July 1, 2025 for marijuana offenses committed before legalization in 2021.
The bill recognized Virginia’s shift in marijuana laws and aimed to provide relief for people still serving time for outdated crimes. But Youngkin, in his veto statement, argued that the bill went too far by potentially benefiting individuals convicted of serious crimes.
“While framed as a measure for non-violent offenders,” he wrote, “this bill would allow sentence reductions for individuals convicted of serious crimes, including those involving fentanyl distribution, sales to minors, and violent offenses where marijuana was a factor.”
He also warned of broader consequences for the justice system. “The proposal places an undue burden on courts, prosecutors, and victims,” Youngkin stated, “requiring hearings even for those whose sentences were enhanced by prior marijuana convictions but were primarily convicted of far more serious offenses.”
Henson, who sponsored the legislation, defended the bill as a matter of justice. 
“We came a long way in legalizing marijuana,” he said. “The question is why are they afraid to give someone a second chance?”
“Justice is supposed to be about balance,” Henson added. “We have people convicted of marijuana-related offenses still suffering, even though what they did is no longer against the law. This bill gave a chance to make things right.”
 No strengthening of union rights

Lastly, the House was unable to secure enough votes to override the governor’s veto of HB 2764, which would have allowed collective bargaining for Virginia’s public employees.
The measure aimed to repeal the state’s ban on public-sector union negotiations and create a Public Employee Relations Board to oversee the process for state and local workers.
The bill required good-faith bargaining over wages, hours and working conditions, and removed a provision mandating secret ballots in union elections — a change critics said could compromise employee privacy.
In his veto statement, Youngkin called the proposal a major policy shift that would “threaten the funding and delivery of critical state and local services” and cost taxpayers “hundreds of millions of dollars a year.” He also criticized the lack of a funding plan, saying agencies were unprepared for the legal and administrative demands.
Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, the bill’s sponsor, said the measure was about standing with workers. 
“Virginia has an opportunity to lead,” she said. “We can demonstrate that we value our workers … by giving them a seat at the table and (improving) our services.”

(Commonwealth Media Services)A few hours before President Donald Trump’s announcements of another round on tariffs, Gov. Josh Shapiro described it as a “disastrous, reckless policy.” He expressed his concern about the impact it would have on businesses and consumers in the state during a visit to a brewery in the Lehigh Valley.
“I’m mindful that we are here today in Bethlehem, on the same day that the federal government is about to impose massive tariffs across the board, and I’m worried about the impacts on Pennsylvania businesses once those tariffs hit and other countries then hit us back with retaliatory tariffs,” Shapiro said Wednesday at Fegley’s Bethlehem Brew Works.
For weeks, Trump has been teasing April 2 for his administration’s announcement on taxing imported products from around the world.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro described the expected tariffs on aluminum and other products from Canada by the Trump administration as a “tax” that would increase prices for consumers and businesses.
“Listen, this is not hard to understand,” Shapiro said. “You do not need a degree in economics in order to make sense of what is about to occur.”
Shapiro specifically highlighted the potential impact on Main Streets across the commonwealth. That included 530 craft breweries, which make Pennsylvania the second-largest craft beer producer in the nation. He said the industry generates $5.4 billion in annual economic impact for the state.
Fegley’s Brew Works was established in 1998 in Bethlehem. Jeff Fegley, the owner of the brewery, said there’s “great concerns” about the impact that tariffs will have on his business.
“What’s going on right now with the economy, the future of the economy, and specifically these tariffs, which are a concern for small businesses like myself and for many,” Fegley said. “And it’s a big unknown as to what’s going to happen, how that’s going to affect them. We have ingredients that come from Canada and other things that are sourced that potentially are going to be increasing overnight.”
Wednesday was the latest stop for Shapiro across Pennsylvania, speaking out against the Trump administration’s tariff policy. The day before, he was in Mifflin County making the case how tariffs would hurt the timber industry.
“I just wish the president wasn’t working against us as recklessly as he is,” Shapiro said Wednesday. “This tariff war that he is starting, this button that he is pushing is going to have one effect, and that effect is to drive up costs on consumers and businesses throughout Pennsylvania at a time where we can’t afford that, and it’s going to make our lives way more difficult.”

During Trump’s successful 2024 campaign, the GOP presidential nominee argued implementing tariffs would help boost American manufacturing and help prevent the flow of fentanyl into the United States.
“What I’ve seen over the first 70 days of his administration is chaos that has resulted in higher prices, fewer rights and more worry from so many people that I meet all across Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
As an example, Shapiro referenced the negative effects of tariffs during Trump’s first term on the hardwood industry he believes is proof it would not achieve what the president said he is setting out to do.
“We have seen enough from him over his first four years and over these first 70 days, the chaos, the confusion, the higher prices to know that the direction he’s heading in right now is really reckless and really dangerous,” Shapiro said.
Shapiro claimed the way to “spur American manufacturing” was by investing in businesses, the workforce, schools, and STEM education in the United States, while also “not eviscerating the Department of Human Services.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/27523_gov_tariffs_10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 19:04:19.080598

Greg Gianforte. Gianforte, a Republican, earlier described it as a “tool tax,” and members of the agricultural and business communities spoke in support of it at a hearing. Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort [&#8230;]","A tractor harvests sugar beets in this aerial photo near Sidney, Montana (Photo by Larry Mayer | Getty Images). On a bipartisan vote Tuesday, the Montana Senate approved a bill to increase the business equipment tax exemption rate, a priority for Gov. Greg Gianforte.
Gianforte, a Republican, earlier described it as a “tool tax,” and members of the agricultural and business communities spoke in support of it at a hearing.
Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, sponsored Senate Bill 322, which he described as a simple bill that offers tax relief to small businesses.
The bill will expand the tax exemption to cover business equipment with a market value of as much as $3 million instead of the current $1 million limit.
Kassmier said an estimated 700 businesses will come off the tax rolls as a result.
“Anytime you allow these small businesses in your community to invest in their businesses in their communities, it grows the local economies,” Kassmier said.
The bill passed a key floor vote Tuesday on a 39-11 count with little debate, and with both Republicans and Democrats in support and in opposition.
It earned significant support in the Senate Tax committee as well, with seven legislators in favor and just one opposed.
But some of the resistance it met was due to another priority for both Republicans and Democrats this session — a property tax cut for residential payers.
“This is a time we don’t need to be giving exemptions, when we need to be giving relief to residential property taxpayers,” said Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, in committee, opposing the bill.
A fiscal analysis of the bill said it reimburses lost revenue to local government jurisdictions and the Montana University System from the general fund to the tune of an estimated $11 million a biennium.
However, the fiscal analysis also said school district mills are not reimbursed and will have tax shifts associated with them. It estimated a $1.3 million decrease for schools.
In committee, Dunwell asked how much more residential and commercial “main street” entities would pay in the shift — “in addition to the huge historic increases they’ve seen” the last couple of reappraisal cycles.
The Montana Department of Revenue’s Dylan Cole said the changes are “not gigantic,” an estimated taxable value drop of 0.35% for school districts. The increase would depend on how much business equipment property is in a district.
“But on average, people’s tax bills will be about 0.35% higher as a result of this,” Cole said.
Rose Bender, with the Montana Budget and Policy Center, said the cut comes on top of a history of decreasing rates and increasing exemptions for business equipment.
In 1989, business equipment tax was cut from 11% to 9%, and it’s been cut repeatedly since, said Bender, in opposition to the bill.
Bender said that rate dropped to 1.5% in 2013 for business equipment valued from $100,000 to $6 million.
The exemption hit $1 million in 2023, a tripling from 2021, and the current proposal would triple it again, Bender said.
A look at the groups that are paying property taxes shows business equipment used to pay 15% of the pie in 1995, and now it pays less than 5%, she said.
But residential payers are in a group that went from paying 38% of all property taxes to paying more than 57% in the same period, Bender said.
Margie MacDonald, with Big Sky 55+, said if the state has those extra millions in its budget, she had some ideas besides help for businesses.
MacDonald, who expressed “soft” opposition to the bill, said the money could help working parents, buy down interest rates to build housing that nurses and teachers can afford — or provide relief for “skyrocketing residential property tax and rents.”
Most members of the public spoke in support of the bill, however, including many connected to agriculture.
The Montana Agricultural Business Association, Montana Chamber of Commerce, Montana Economic Development Association, Montana Building Industry Association, Montana Taxpayers Association, and others supported the bill.
John Semple, with the Montana Grain Growers Association, said the bill would allow his members to put more money back into farming endeavors.
“Most of our equipment that we use to raise a crop costs quite a bit of money,” Semple said.
Earlier this month at a press conference, Gianforte said the bill should be a priority if Montanans are serious about addressing the affordability crisis.
“We should call this tax what it is, it’s a tool tax,” Gianforte said. “It’s an annual sales tax on equipment, and it never goes away.”
He said the bill would allow family farms and ranches to invest in their operations instead of repeatedly paying the state for their own equipment.
“For farmers, it’s a tax on tractors and a tax on combines,” Gianforte said. “For dentists and doctors, it’s a tax on machines, and even their instruments.
“For restaurant owners, it’s a tax on grills, and even knives, forks, and spoons. For a carpenter, welder, plumber, or homebuilder, it’s a tax on their tools.”
The Governor’s Office said previous bills in 2021 and 2023, also sponsored by Kassmier and signed by Gianforte, expanded the exemption from $100,000 to $1 million, “eliminating the business equipment tax burden for more than 5,000 small businesses, farms, and ranches.”
In a video posted on the governor’s site, farmer Brent Hanford from Fort Benton said the increase to the exemption makes sense for family farms.
Hanford said one tractor alone can cost half a million dollars, and a new combine with an attachment can cost $700,000.
“Two pieces of equipment will get you over one million bucks in a hurry,” Hanford said.
One Democrat, Sen. Ellie Boldman of Missoula, signed onto the bill as a sponsor, as did four other Republicans, Sens. Butch Gillespie of Ethridge, Wendy McKamey of Great Falls, Gayle Lammers of Hardin, and Rep. Randyn Gregg of White Sulphur Springs.

Gov. Mike Dunleavy could hire an aide in the governor’s office who is knowledgeable in Alaska agriculture to work with the existing staff in the Department of Natural Resources. The goal should be to craft a plan to increase agriculture on a statewide basis to submit to the next legislative session.
Existing agricultural policies are Railbelt-centric and need to be designed to address food security statewide. The greatest need is in rural areas off the road system where food costs are very high. Particular attention needs to be paid to the small communities in the Yukon and Kuskokwim river deltas, which are suffering from major losses of subsistence resources.
The successes of hydroponic gardening in the state need to be examined along with the experiences of gardens in roadless communities.
Some small rural communities have achieved great success in food security and even are supplying others with fresh produce year-round.
Take Old Harbor, a small Native village on Kodiak Island. With three high hoop greenhouses, raised beds, and multiple hydroponic systems, the Sitkalidak Sunrise Farm grows rainbow chard, cabbage, potatoes, celery, romaine, radishes, tomatoes, beans, peas, cucumbers, onions, green peppers, many varieties of squashes and more. The farm also has some fruit production, including a few beautiful cherry, apple, pears, kiwi and plum trees producing in one of the hoop houses.
The community also has a herd of buffalo purchased from a Kodiak Island rancher. Three young buffalo bulls recently were obtained from a Native American tribe in Montana to strengthen the genetic pool of a herd of 70 animals. Sitkalidak plans to add pigs and chickens.
Children play a key role in farming activities. Sales to other communities are planned.
Tyonek, a small Native community on the western shore of Cook Inlet, even produced the first Alaska-grown watermelon.
Tyonek Grown is designed to enhance food security and provide fresh organic vegetables to community members. The garden has grown into a 1.5-acre operation with two high tunnels —± 48 feet by 22 feet — solar-powered irrigation and ventilation systems, 15 raised beds, over 2,000 row feet of potatoes and mixed vegetable crops, perennial fruits, and plans for expansion in the coming years.
Like Old Harbor, Tyonek has incorporated children in farming operations to create long-term community interest in the project. Surplus production is sold in Anchorage.
The biggest rural farm is in Bethel. Meyers Farm grew from a small family farm into an operation that supplies Bethel, Nome, numerous Western Alaska villages, and some more distant schools like Cordova on a year-round basis. Some produce also is sold in Anchorage and other communities.
Tim Meyers stripped off the tundra on a couple of acres to allow the ground to thaw and composted the tundra for his gardens. “I just tilled up the ground, and everything grew,” Meyers told the Anchorage Daily News.
Here’s how the ADN described Meyers’ operation: A vacuum system sucks seeds through tiny holes he drilled in baking sheets to land in their assigned cell in planting trays. A potato-planting contraption that he made features a spot for Lisa, his wife, to sit as she drops plants into holes being punched at the same time an irrigation drip line is laid down. Then everything is buried, all in one pass. An Amish-built machine lets them plant 1,000 vegetable starts in an hour.
The Meyers Farm includes numerous raised beds, high hoop greenhouses and a massive underground storage area, which stays at 31 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter and is a little warmer in the summer. In addition Western Alaska communities and Anchorage, The farm also sells to schools located in Cordova, King Cove, Sand Point and Naknek.
Recent hydroponics efforts on the Kenai Peninsula have shown promise and drawn praise from residents. Edgy Veggies and fresh365 located in Soldotna are producing vegetables year-round, but both say summer sales are slow, as many locals produce vegetables in home gardens. Winter sales are strong. Power costs are high though.
There are several gardening initiatives led by Native organizations throughout Western Alaska. Budget cuts in the U.S. Department of Agriculture may impede these efforts.

Six Colorado State University students have had their visas revoked, according to university spokesperson Tiana Kennedy. The university encouraged all students with concerns to contact their home country embassy as well as the CSU Office of International Programs. CSU initially reported five students affected on Tuesday, but the university learned of one more overnight.

The University of Colorado said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security revoked student visas, known as F-1 Visas, for four students at its Boulder and Colorado Springs campuses. 
“At CU we are focused on supporting the success of all of our students, including international students,” the university said in a statement. “Each one of our students are seeking to advance their careers and the lives of their families, and we understand the anxieties that visa revocations cause to impacted students.”
CSU and CU declined to provide additional information to protect the privacy of affected students.
It is not clear why the Colorado students had their visas revoked, but President Donald Trump issued an executive order targeting student visas of those who participated in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student with a green card, making him a legal permanent resident, in March after he helped organize a protest calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. 
Administration officials have claimed, without evidence, that he is actively supporting Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization and which attacked Israel in 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, sparking Israel’s war that has killed more than 40,000 people in Gaza.
Representatives for Metropolitan State University, Colorado Mesa University, Colorado Mountain College and Western Colorado University said they have not had students affected by visa revocations as of Wednesday, though they are monitoring the situation.

Teresa Ibach of Sumner speaks on the legislative floor on Tuesday, May 16, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A bill to exempt feedlots from Nebraska branding and inspection fees is headed to the second round of legislative debate after Wednesday’s 26-2 vote. 
After hours of debate, State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, in west-central Nebraska, amended Legislative Bill 646 to cap the amount the Brand Committee can charge feedlots and seek to exempt feedlots in the state’s brand inspection area from paying branding-related fees. It would replace them with a one-time payment of $500 to apply for feedlots to get an exempt status. The bill also exempts dairy cattle. 
“I think this is good legislation,” Ibach said. “This will be a good thing going forward.” 
Ibach said she is open to additional amendments to her priority bill regarding the language of the fee structure and other technical issues lawmakers might have. She faced opposition from State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, a freshman rural lawmaker from north-central Nebraska, who proposed an amendment to essentially kill the bill—an effort that failed Wednesday while urban lawmakers chose not to weigh in. 
Storer has expressed concerns about lawmakers making an uninformed decision about the agency responsible for investigating cattle theft and verifying ownership through branding when cattle are bought, sold, or moved in and out of the brand zone established by state law, which essentially covers the western two-thirds of the state. She also said the agency could not fund itself after the change. 
The Nebraska Brand Committee is funded entirely through fees, not by taxpayers. If Ibach’s bill passes, the committee would lose $1.6 million annually, roughly 25% of its operating budget, according to the bill’s fiscal note.

“This is a major technical change to Nebraska’s brand act that addresses oversight and law enforcement for our number one cash commodity,” Storer said on the floor Wednesday. 
Storer said cattle are an essential economic engine for the state, and that she is trying to protect the integrity of the Nebraska Brand Committee. State Sens. Mike Jacobson of North Platte said the proposed change would be a “big shock to the system.”
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair said the agricultural industry is too important for Nebraska to continue having routine fights over branding. 
“I’ve listened to the same argument every year for seven years,” Hansen said. “It is time we act.”  
The rural divide between lawmakers is quite rare. While Democratic lawmakers have led many bill debates in this legislative session, Republicans mostly led the discussion about Ibach’s bill. Most urban and Democratic-aligned lawmakers didn’t weigh in, but some asked questions about the state’s quirky branding law. State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, for example, asked Ibach and Storer about the budget of the Brand Committee.
Other cattle-feeding states, including Texas and Oklahoma, deal with cattle branding differently. Branding isn’t mandatory in those states but is encouraged to deter theft, while brand inspections are mandatory in Wyoming and Colorado. Hansen hinted that Nebraska should be more like Texas. 
Nebraska is the second-largest cattle-producing state in the U.S., generating $13.2 billion from cattle and other livestock, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. The Nebraska Brand Committee regulates parts of that industry.
The Nebraska Farm Bureau and Nebraska Brand Committee lost Wednesday’s rural political battle, while the Nebraska Cattlemen were on the winning side. The Brand Committee called the legislation an attempt to “severely” weaken the cattle industry’s checks and balances. The Farm Bureau, in a statement, said“the Committee should have the fee authority necessary to adequately fund its programs.”
The Cattlemen’s Board of Directors initially opposed LB 646 but voted to support the amended bill on Tuesday, saying it’s “time to stop kicking the can down the road on critical brand law reforms in the state of Nebraska.”
Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara said regardless of what the statehouse does, some in the cattle industry will be upset. 
“Either way, this would be a civil war in Nebraska,” Dekay said.

(Courtesy of Rhode Island Department of Transportation)Rhode Island’s statewide bus network already allows some commuter rail pass holders to ride its buses for free, but one lawmaker is making his annual push to take that integration with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) even further.
Legislation sponsored by Rep. John Lombardi, a Providence Democrat, would enable the Rhode Island Public Authority (RIPTA) to collaborate with the MBTA so all passes work on the Ocean State’s bus network — and vice versa. 
Lombardi’s bill received its initial hearing before the House Committee on Corporations, where it was held for further study as is standard procedure.
“This is a cost-saving consumer protection measure for people in the less affluent communities of Rhode Island,” Lombardi told the committee. “This just makes sense.”
Allowing dual passes would also allow the state to meet one of the major planks of its Transit Forward RI 2040 plan, which envisions expanded and accessible service across the region.
But RIPTA doesn’t need legislation to collaborate with its Boston-based counterpart. Commuters who have monthly train passes to ride out of Wickford Junction, T.F. Green International Airport, and Providence and Pawtucket’s MBTA stations can already ride Rhode Island’s bus network for no extra charge.
Passes for those zones are also available in Kingston, Massachusetts, and the communities of East Taunton, Fall River, Middleboro, and New Bedford — where stations opened this March for the new South Coast Rail line.
Agency spokesperson Sara Furbush said RIPTA is already in communication with the MBTA about exploring more opportunities to make more Massachusetts-based transit passes available for use in Rhode Island.
“That said, we appreciate the support and visibility,” she said in an email to Rhode Island Current about Lombardi’s proposal. “Expanding this type of fare integration and making dual passes more widely available is something we would like to see become a reality.”
This is the ninth consecutive session that Lombardi has pitched which he calls a way to push for more collaboration. Since 2017, his bill has never been voted out of committee.
“It is what it is, but I’ll keep doing it until I hear different,” Lombardi said in an interview Wednesday. “I never hear opposition, so I don’t know what the problem is.”
No one spoke in person on Lombardi’s bill during Wednesday’s committee hearing, but 10 people did submit written testimony in favor of the proposal.
“Transportation options such as rail and bus are vitally important to Rhode Islanders who do not own a vehicle,” wrote Matt Netto, associate state director for AARP Rhode Island. “These modes of transportation increase access and convenience for all looking to travel throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts.”
Longtime transit advocate and former RIPTA board member Barry Schiller did offer an amendment to the bill on behalf of Rhode Island Transit Riders. He called on state transportation officials to collaborate not just with the MBTA, but also Amtrak and other regional transit authorities in Massachusetts — all would need to report back to legislative leaders by Jan. 1, 2026.
MBTA spokesperson Lisa Battison told Rhode Island Current the agency is always happy to work with RIPTA “in best serving the riding public.”

Free.,"U.S. House Dems say NOAA cuts will harm weather forecasting, fisheries, Navy operations",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-dems-say-noaa-cuts-will-harm-weather-forecasting-fisheries-navy-operations,,"Democrats on the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee and a panel of experts on Wednesday blasted the Trump administration’s reduction to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s budget and workforce, citing consequences for everyday weather data, national security and affected industries.Virtually every American interacts with NOAA’s weather data, which supplies forecasting services across the country.The agency’s climate and oceanic research supports the U.S. Navy’s operations and even the commercial fishing industry – described during the forum as having “a love-hate relationship” with the agency – depends on NOAA to open and close fisheries, the lawmakers and experts said.But those missions were imperiled in February by the firings of 7% of NOAA’s staff of scientists and others overseeing federal research and monitoring of weather and oceans, the group of Democrats said.“These critical functions are being dismantled by the sweeping, indiscriminate layoffs of nonpartisan public servants and facility closures,” U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner, a Rhode Island Democrat who led the forum, said.The reductions in force at NOAA, which houses agencies including the National Weather Service, National Ocean Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, were part of across-the-board cuts to the federal workforce sought by President Donald Trump and billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk.The group of Democrats, who met without involvement of the committee’s Republican majority, said the cuts would hurt a wide range of Americans who depend on the agency’s data collection and rulemaking.Data collection and disseminationOne of NOAA’s core missions is collecting and publishing weather data across the country used in forecasting apps and other common sources of weather information.“There is no weather forecast that's produced in this country that isn't dependent on NOAA, none” Mary Glackin, a former deputy under secretary for operations at the agency under presidents of both parties, said.The availability of federal data made possible the creation of companies like Accuweather, which started by collecting data in a garage, Glackin said.U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Jon White told the panel NOAA’s extensive forecasting data was also critical to naval operations, saying reductions in that data would hurt the military’s readiness, both shipping out of domestic stations and in potential conflict zones.“Hurricane forecasting and typhoon forecasting rely on the data from NOAA, whether it's satellite data,” White said. “Reductions in that data and that information provide critical threats to our military infrastructure. Ships that (start) out of Norfolk and San Diego rely on that information about upcoming storms, especially hurricanes on the East Coast. … It's not just billions of dollars of ship damage: It's lives that are at stake.”Industry needs NOAAMagaziner was the one who called the commercial fishing industry’s connection with NOAA “a love-hate relationship,” but he and witnesses noted that the agency oversees the most basic functions the industry needs to operate.Sarah Schumann, a fisherman with operations in Rhode Island and Alaska, criticized President Joe Biden’s administration for allying too strongly with offshore wind developers, but said the new administration’s actions were also detrimental to the industry.“These cuts will bog down the agency's ability to serve the public for fishermen,” Schumann said. “Because of climate change, we desperately need faster, more nimble and more collaborative data collection and decision-making, and there is a very slim chance we're going to get that with this.”Trump’s slowdown of regulations – requiring federal agencies to withdraw 10 regulations for every one new regulation put into place – has also hampered commercial fishing operations.Opening and closing fisheries for a season are done through NOAA rulemaking, environmental attorney Lizzie Lewis told the panel. Bluefin tuna fisheries were not closed on time and were overfished by 125% and fisheries in New England are unlikely to open on time, she said.Efficiency?The cuts, part of Musk’s initiative to make government more efficient, are not having their intended effect in streamlining government, Magaziner and others on the panel, including New Mexico’s Melanie Stansbury, said.“The assertion that mass layoffs will somehow improve efficiency is not only misleading, it is outright dangerous,” Magaziner said. “Real people, real jobs and real lives are on the line. Without NOAA’s real-time data,  emergency responders are left without the critical information they need to respond to impending disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, floods and severe storms putting millions at risk.”The layoffs also decimated morale at the agency and made attracting qualified young people to its public service mission more difficult, Lewis told the panel.“We are losing an entire generation of scientists and leaders who can help this country,” Lewis said. “We can keep its people safe and can grow its economy. And that to me is the devastating human cost.”",,,,2025-04-02 19:04:19.080598

Free.,Senate GOP budget resolution sets stage for raising debt limit by as much as $5 trillion,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/senate-gop-budget-resolution-sets-stage-raising-debt-limit-much-5-trillion,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans released an updated budget resolution Wednesday that sets a May 9 deadline for more than a dozen committees to approve their slice of the massive package that will permanently extend the GOP tax cuts and make significant reductions in spending.The 70-page budget resolution, however, includes different guidelines for the House and Senate committees, allowing GOP leaders to sidestep their differences on policy for the moment, but not the long haul.The budget resolution also sets the stage for the House to raise the debt limit by $4 trillion and the Senate to lift it by not more than $5 trillion in the reconciliation package.Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote in a statement that final approval of the budget resolution would “unlock the ability for the appropriate Senate committees to fully fund our border needs for four years, provide much-needed financial relief to our military at a time of great danger, make the 2017 tax cuts permanent to energize the economy, and do what has been promised for decades: go through every line item of the budget to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending — hopefully by the trillions.”Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., released a statement of his own, saying the “parliamentarian has reviewed the Budget Committee’s substitute amendment and deemed it appropriate for consideration under the Budget Act.”“It is now time for the Senate to move forward with this budget resolution in order to further advance our shared Republican agenda in Congress,” Thune wrote.The Senate parliamentarian is the nonpartisan scorekeeper who ensures everything included in a reconciliation bill meets the chamber’s strict rules.Here comes the vote-a-ramaThe complicated reconciliation process will allow the GOP to approve its core policy goals without needing support from Democrats in the Senate, where 60 votes are usually needed to advance legislation. Reconciliation does, however, come with several hoops to jump through.One of those hurdles will come later this week when the Senate endures the dreaded vote-a-rama; a marathon amendment voting session that typically lasts overnight. After that, senators will be able to send the budget resolution to the House for final approval.The tax-and-spending blueprint released Wednesday will send a dozen House committees instructions on how to draft their pieces of the package, while 10 Senate committees will write bills.Typically, the committee instructions, which just include a budget target, are similar, if not identical, for the House and Senate. But differences of opinion between Republican leaders about how much to cut federal spending, as well as other disagreements, led to differing instructions.The House has a significantly higher threshold for cutting government spending than the Senate.The Agriculture Committee needs to slice at least $230 billion; Education and Workforce must reduce spending by a minimum of $330 billion; Energy and Commerce needs to cut no less than $880 billion; Financial Services must find at least $1 billion in savings; Natural Resources has a minimum of $1 billion; Oversight and Government Reform has a floor of $50 billion; and the Transportation Committee needs to reduce deficits by $10 billion or more.House committees that can increase the federal deficit include the Armed Services Committee with a cap of $100 billion in new spending, Homeland Security with a $90 billion ceiling for new funding for programs it oversees, Judiciary with a maximum of $110 billion and Ways and Means, which can increase deficits up to $4.5 trillion for tax cuts.Spending cuts in SenateSenators set a much lower bar for themselves in terms of spending cuts, though the way the reconciliation instructions are written, as a floor and not a ceiling, will give leeway for those committees to cut much more.Four Senate committees — Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Energy and Natural Resources; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP — must each find at least $1 billion in spending cuts over the 10-year budget window.Senate committees also got instructions for increasing the deficit, which will allow them to spend up to the dollar amount outlined in the budget resolution. Those committees include Armed Services at $150 billion; Commerce, Science and Transportation with $20 billion; Environment and Public Works at $1 billion; Finance with $1.5 trillion in new deficits, likely for tax cuts; Homeland Security at $175 billion and Judiciary with $175 billion.Once the House and Senate both vote to adopt the same budget resolution, the committees can formally begin drafting and marking up their bills.Those bills, according to the instructions, must be sent to the Budget committees before May 9. That panel will then bundle all of the various pieces together into one reconciliation package and send it to the floor.The House and Senate must vote to approve the same reconciliation package before it can go to President Donald Trump for his signature and become law.Republicans have a paper-thin majority in the House and will need to ensure that lawmakers from across the party support all of the elements going into the reconciliation package. Even a few defectors in that chamber could block the bill from moving forward.Senate GOP leaders have a bit more wiggle room, but cannot lose more than three of their members and pass a reconciliation bill.",,,,2025-04-02 19:04:19.080598

Gov. Larry Rhoden signed Senate Bill 54 into law on Friday.

(Paul Kosel/Groton Independent) A move to put more tobacco tax money toward South Dakota’s day-to-day government expenses might mean more mosquito bites — and a greater risk of West Nile virus — after July.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed Senate Bill 54 into law on Friday. It reduces the amount of yearly tobacco tax revenue used to help people quit and avoid smoking from $5 million to $2 million. The rest of the money raised annually by the tax — more than $40 million, typically — goes to the state’s general fund.
Backers of the bill said smoking rates have dropped, the need for prevention is lower, and the state needs the money to pay for its expanded Medicaid program. Opponents called the move foolish, citing spikes in the use of nicotine vape products as a blind spot in tobacco prevention that could cause public health trouble down the road.
Budget committee approves $3 million cut to SD’s tobacco-use prevention fund

One piece of the tobacco tax change didn’t get much attention, though. 
For the past 10 years, South Dakota has funneled a half-million dollars of the sin tax bounty it collects annually from tobacco users into mosquito control grants for cities and counties.
Those grants, cities and counties learned last week, won’t be available for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1.
The goal of the grant program was to reduce the risk of West Nile virus, the most severe version of which can be deadly. Fifty-four South Dakotans have died from West Nile since 1999.
The loss of the grant money could impact smaller communities more than larger ones. Joe Kippley, public health director for the city of Sioux Falls, said his department anticipated the loss and has budgeted to continue mosquito spraying. 
In smaller towns, the loss of grant funding could be a little harder to replace.
After this summer, “we’re not sure what will happen,” Viborg Finance Officer Brandy Skonhovd said.
Moving mosquito money around
The story of how cigarette dollars turned into insecticide grants begins in 2006. 
That’s the year voters passed Initiated Measure 2, which slapped an additional $1-per-pack tax on cigarettes and an extra 25% tax on other forms of tobacco on top of the state’s existing tobacco taxes.
The first $30 million of tax revenue generated as a result went to the state’s general fund, the measure specified, after which $5 million would be put in the Tobacco Prevention and Reduction Trust Fund and used for anti-smoking programming.

Tax collections beyond $35 million would split between the Property Tax Reduction Fund, the Education Enhancement Tobacco Trust Fund and the Health Care Tobacco Trust Fund. 
That setup had shifted by 2014. 
That’s the year Doneen Hollingsworth, who was the secretary of the Department of Health, asked lawmakers to sign off on using a half-million dollars from the $5 million anti-smoking fund for mosquito control grants. 
The recession of 2007 through 2009 tightened budgets, she said. The state had already begun to dip into that fund to pay for things like childhood immunizations, she told them, and there was a new problem to address in 2014.
The federal money for West Nile monitoring and mosquito control made available to states when the virus first emerged had dried up. Then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard proposed using tobacco tax money that year, Hollingsworth said, “to address this urgent public health issue” by keeping the grant money flowing to local governments.
That wouldn’t break the law, Hollingsworth assured the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee. 
The state, in 2014 and today, gets about a million anti-smoking dollars a year from the federal government. As long as that money is available, she said, the state could skim up to a million prevention trust fund dollars off the top and still meet voters’ expectations.
“We’ve always spent at least $5 million on tobacco prevention and control,” she said.
Another tobacco tax shift
Since then, the state has spent about $5 million from the fund to control mosquitoes. Grant awards, used for chemicals or the equipment needed to spray it, are tied to the prevalence and risk of West Nile in local communities. 
During debate on this year’s legislative Senate Bill 54, Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger told lawmakers it never made much sense to tie the grants to tobacco funding. 
“That’s an example of the different things that I think can go away, and we could be smarter with these funds,” the commissioner told the Senate Appropriations Committee in February, during his pitch for reducing the amount of tobacco tax money the state spends on anti-smoking programs. 
Terwilliger rattled off statistics on lower smoking rates among teens and adults in the years since voters passed the tobacco tax, too, and said South Dakota spends more on anti-tobacco programming than other states.
Prevention groups fear consequences from Noem’s proposal to reduce funding for anti-tobacco efforts

Jennifer Stalley, Midwest policy director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, was on hand to refute Terwilliger point-by-point in her opposition testimony. 
But she and Terwilliger saw eye to eye on one thing. 
“I would tell you that I don’t think that fits within the letter of the law,” Stalley said of the use of tobacco money for mosquito control.
Lawmakers’ passage of SB 54 put an end to the $500,000 carve-out for West Nile, and appropriators didn’t supplement the state budget with any replacement funds to keep the grants going.
Tia Kafka, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, said the state will continue parts of its West Nile virus programming. That includes federally funded risk prediction modeling and a federally funded epidemiologist to serve as the program’s overseer. 
Also continued will be the state’s West Nile Virus dashboard, which shows modeled risk and the mapped results of the mosquito collection efforts that attempt to catalog the prevalence of the mosquito species that spread the virus.
“However, very limited mosquito testing will occur in 2025, and the program’s sustainability beyond that year is uncertain,” Kafka said.
Virus modeling predicted 60 cases for 2024; the dashboard lists 21 total West Nile cases and one death from the disease. The Health Department’s website does not show a prediction for 2025.
Cities plan for uncertain future
It costs Viborg around $2,500 to buy the insecticide used to reduce West Nile risk, according to Skonhovd, the city finance officer. The city got $8,000 last year, though, to pay for new equipment.
The spraying in and around the southeast South Dakota town of 834 starts in May and continues into the fall. 
“When we have football games, we try to keep the mosquito population down for those,” Skonhovd said.
Paul Kosel runs the mosquito control program for Groton, population 1,355. Kosel is also the newspaper publisher and information technology supervisor for the community, bordered by wetlands on the eastern side of Brown County. That county has long been the state’s most reliably risky for West Nile in the two-plus decades the disease has been endemic in South Dakota.
“Trying to do mosquito control in Groton is a living nightmare because we’re surrounded by water,” Kosel said.

Kosel and Skonhovd both say they feel confident they’ll be able to pay for this year’s work with the money that’s available until July 1, when the tobacco-funded grant spigot turns off with the end of the state’s fiscal year. 
After that, they both hope the state finds a way to keep things going. Insecticide and equipment can be a strain on a small-town budget.
“It’s not cheap, that’s for sure,” Kosel said.
Larger cities could have an easier time. Joe Kippley, public health director for the city of Sioux Falls, set aside $750,000 for mosquito control this summer. Last year, the city received $20,000 from the state for spraying, but Kippley said the city knew the money would go away this year, and that it had previously set its budget up to withstand the expense of spraying with or without state help.
“We do not budget for these grant dollars annually because they are distributed through an application process and are therefore not guaranteed each year,” Kippley said in an emailed statement. “The discontinuation of this funding will not impact the city’s mosquito control program and services.”

More than 125,000 Minnesota households get help with their winter heating bills through the federal  Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, but that’s at risk now because the entire staff that run the program has been fired. 
As part of massive cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, every staffer was laid off from the Division of Energy Assistance, NPR reported this week.

The nonprofit energy consumer advocate Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, known as CUB, released a statement Wednesday decrying the cuts. 


“Energy Assistance is a vital and extremely popular program,” said Annie Levenson-Falk, CUB’s executive director. “Even a delay in funding will mean that eligible Minnesotans risk utility shutoffs or being unable to refill empty propane or fuel oil tanks.” 


CUB says Minnesota is currently awaiting the final 10% of federal funding for the current program year, which was approved by Congress. If the funding is delayed, support to Minnesota households will be paused. .


About 75% of the energy assistance goes to households outside the 7-county metropolitan area, according to CUB.

(Photo courtesy Western New Mexico University)Western New Mexico University’s new board of regents will meet for the first time next week, taking the first steps in getting the university “back on track” following claims of misuse of funds and violation of fiduciary responsibilities.
The state Senate confirmed four regents for the Silver City university during the recent 60-day session, including former state Sen. Steven Neville, attorney John Wertheim, WNMU alumnus J. Dean Reed and student regent Keana Huerta.
The fifth regent seat remains empty. A spokesperson for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Source NM that they did not have any updates about when the governor might announce a fifth regent nomination.
The terms of two members of the previous board of regents expired at the end of December and the other three regents submitted their resignations in January, about a year after the New Mexico Office of the State Auditor reported finding university leadership had misused hundreds of thousands of public funds on lavish trips and other spending. 
The board voted in December to terminate former university President Joseph Shepard’s contract and then authorized a $1.9 million severance package. Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a civil suit against Shepard and the board in January, alleging they had violated fiduciary duties, New Mexico’s anti-donation clause, the Open Meetings Act and laws pertaining to unjust enrichment, not fulfilling contractual obligations and acting on an unenforceable contract.
Shepard filed a motion in March to dismiss the case against him, which Torrez opposes. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for June 16, according to court records.
Huerta told Source NM in a statement that the new board intends to keep the university’s students at the forefront of “our discussions and work diligently to ensure that any issues are addressed appropriately.”

“We as the board are committed to doing the right thing in this situation,” Huerta told Source in a written statement. “Ensuring transparency and accountability while upholding the integrity of the institution are our priorities.”
Huerta is originally from the Silver City area and a third-year student at WNMU, which she said makes her uniquely qualified to “understand the needs and challenges of our local students, faculty, and staff,” she said.
Neville, a former state senator who represented Senate District 2 in San Juan County, told Source he does not want to make a judgement on the ongoing investigation and litigation until he has more facts and that he will leave the legal action to the attorney general and the state auditor.

“My job is to try to get us a new president, try to get things back on track, make sure that the books are balanced and go from there,” he said, noting that ensuring students’ experiences remain positive and quality education is provided are a priority. “Western’s a very good university so we want to make sure that that focus continues.”
Neville added that he has spoken to his fellow regents and said they are all working on gaining more knowledge of the university’s situation and are thinking along similar lines in regard to their next steps.
Legislators introduced four pieces of legislation addressing the role of university regents and how they are chosen during the recent 60-day session, but only one bill passed and awaits the governor’s signature. Senate Bill 19 would require new regents to complete 10 hours of training within six months of being appointed. 
House Joint Resolution 12, supported by the attorney general, died in a Senate committee, and proposed asking voters to approve a constitutional amendment codifying regents’ fiduciary duties, moving proceedings to remove regents from the state Supreme Court to district courts and allow the attorney general or majority of the board to initiate removal of a regent.
Senate Joint Resolution 7 also died in a Senate committee. The resolution proposed an amendment to the state Constitution requiring the governor to select regents from a vetted list provided by a nominating committee. 
Senate Bill 266 would have required regents to submit certain employment contracts to the State Board of Finance for approval, adding a level of oversight to boards of regents.

North Dakotans in 2022 passed a measure that put term limits for state legislators into the  constitution. Lawmakers are now limited to serving up to eight years in the House and up to eight years in the Senate.
The resolution creates a ballot measure that, if approved by voters in 2026, would allow lawmakers to serve four complete terms, a total of 16 years, in either chamber of the Legislature. It also clarifies a partial term of a lawmaker would not count against the term limit.
The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, passed the Senate in March on a 24-23 vote.
Before Wednesday’s vote, Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, warned that the proposal doesn’t make a significant enough change for lawmakers who think more experience is beneficial in the Legislature. 
Rep. Christina Wolff, R-Minot, said there is still a question of whether the resolution is even constitutional, given a provision included in the 2022 measure that says only a citizen-initiated measure could undo the term limits. 
Wolff, who is in her first term, also questioned the value of legislative experience.  
“I realize that there’s a lot of really good information that people like me, new people here, could use, but that institutional knowledge has also tripled the budget in the last 10 years,” she said.

The Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Walters, his administration and the state Board of Education in Oklahoma County District Court. 
The lawsuit accuses the Oklahoma State Department of Education of violating open meetings laws and of improperly withholding records detailing Walters’ Library Media Advisory Committee.
In an unrelated matter, Walters sued the Freedom From Religion Foundation on Monday in Muskogee federal court, complaining of the cease-and-desist letters the Wisconsin-based organization has sent to Oklahoma schools over alleged violations of church-state separation.

“Oklahoma will never be bullied by radical, out-of-state atheists who use intimidation and harassment against kids,” Walters said in a statement.
The two organizations have been involved in a court battle against Walters before. Both supplied attorneys to a pending lawsuit challenging Walters’ purchase of Bibles with state funds and his mandate that schools teach from the Christian text. 
Walters’ lawsuit accused the Freedom from Religion Foundation of inhibiting religious freedom in Achille Public Schools when it discouraged the southeast Oklahoma district from having student-led prayer during morning announcements.
The foundation called the lawsuit frivolous and said it won’t back down. 
The civil suit filed against Walters on Tuesday was “nothing more than a politically motivated attack,” Walters said in a statement through a spokesperson.
“These extremists are using the legal system to harass and obstruct progress in an effort to push their radical agenda,” Walters said.
Oklahoma Appleseed filed its case after the state agency failed to provide details of the formation, membership selection and activities of the Library Media Advisory Committee despite repeated requests, according to the lawsuit.
The Tulsa-based nonprofit requested that a judge order the Education Department to release the records and pay for the group’s attorney fees. 
The lawsuit also asked a judge to declare that the agency violated the Oklahoma Open Records Act and that the advisory committee broke the state’s Open Meeting Act, which requires government boards to conduct their business in public view.
“This lawsuit is about government transparency and accountability,” Oklahoma Appleseed legal director Brent Rowland said in a statement. “The public has a right to know who is making decisions affecting its public schools. Oklahomans have a right to expect that their government will follow the law regarding open records and open meetings.”
The Education Department has said it doesn’t view the advisory committee as a “public body” subject to open meeting laws.
“The Library Media Advisory Committee is a volunteer-based group responsible for reviewing books for suitability to minor students based on content,” the agency’s open records office wrote to Oklahoma Voice on Dec. 17 in response to a request for documents. “Please note that this committee is exempt from the Open Meetings Act, as it does not have decision-making authority or engage in formal deliberations. It does not meet the legal definition of a ‘public body,’ as it does not conduct meetings or engage in decision-making activities. Its role is solely advisory, and it is not supported by, nor entrusted with the management of, public funds or property.”

Walters formed the advisory committee in 2023 to review whether certain books are age-appropriate for schools or whether they violate state rules against sexual content. 
Following the committee’s recommendation, the Education Department ordered Edmond Public Schools to remove the best-selling novels “The Kite Runner” and “The Glass Castle” from its high school libraries. Edmond appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, who decided that local schools, not the state Education Department, have control over what books to keep on their library shelves.
Walters and his administration have refused to disclose the names of the advisory committee members but one — out-of-state social media personality Chaya Raichik, who runs an account known as Libs of TikTok. 
Raichik and the Library Media Advisory Committee also are named as defendants in the Oklahoma Appleseed lawsuit.
“(The state Education Department) will not be bullied by extremist organizations trying to weaponize the courts and remains committed to transparency and compliance with all legal requirements,” Walters said.
The state agency has denied multiple requests from news media, including Oklahoma Voice, to identify the rest of the committee’s members. 
Email records the agency provided to Oklahoma Voice were heavily redacted to cover up individuals’ names. The Education Department’s open records office has so far refused to cite a state law requiring that these names be kept confidential.
Oklahoma Appleseed contended these records should be available to the public with “narrowly tailored and legally justified redactions.”
“In this instance, the state Department of Education has formed a Library Media Advisory Committee to make decisions about students’ access to books when our state Supreme Court has determined those decisions should be made by local school boards,” Rowland said. “State officials cannot hide behind closed doors and avoid public accountability, and why would they want to?”

Free.,"Vexed by judicial restraints on Trump, U.S. Senate GOP floats bill to undercut courts",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/vexed-judicial-restraints-trump-us-senate-gop-floats-bill-undercut-courts,,"WASHINGTON — Amid dozens of injunctions placed against the Trump administration, Republicans on the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary discussed a bill Wednesday to curb the nationwide effects of those orders from federal judges.The bill, sponsored by GOP Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who leads the committee, would prohibit district court judges from issuing injunctions that have nationwide effects.“We all have to agree to give up the universal injunction as a weapon against policies we disagree with,” Grassley said. “The damage it causes to the judicial system and to our democracy is too great.”As of Friday, 39 judges who were appointed across “five different presidents and sitting in 11 different district courts across seven circuits” have ruled against the Trump administration, said one of the witnesses, Stephen Vladeck of Georgetown University Law Center.President Donald Trump and Republican allies in Congress have complained that such injunctions give judges in single districts too much power to stymie the administration’s agenda.Trump has also taken to social media to attack the judges, especially one who temporarily barred use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to quickly deport Venezuelan nationals.Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said Tuesday that Republicans are considering Grassley’s bill, but did not commit to bringing it to the floor for a vote.House Republicans have introduced a similar bill.Senate Democrats criticized the hearing and argued that the reason there are so many injunctions against the president’s executive orders is because they are unconstitutional.The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, pointed to the several nationwide injunctions against Trump’s executive order to end the constitutional right to birthright citizenship, which the administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court in an emergency request to reverse.Republicans see abuseRepublicans characterized the flurry of injunctions against administration actions as judicial activism.Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said the injunctions were unprecedented.Hawley called the rulings from district courts a “pattern of abuse.” He added that it’s not only being done with nationwide injunctions, but with temporary restraining orders.Florida Sen. Ashley Moody also took issue with temporary restraining orders, which generally are not appealable.“There is keen interest in making sure our judiciary system remains impartial and that it is making rulings only in terms of relief to the parties before it and that we are encouraging expeditious resolution of these extraordinary important matters,” Moody said.Criticism sparks threats, Dems saySens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island raised concerns about the increased threats of violence aimed at judges.Whitehouse said the reaction from Republicans about preliminary injunctions against the Trump administration puts those judges and their families at risk.“The discomfort to fury…about decisions against the Trump administration may actually have a lot to do with the unprecedented lawlessness and lawbreaking of the Trump administration rather than a weird cabal of judges trying to intrude,” Whitehouse said.Klobuchar said that Trump has attacked judges on social media and has posted images of himself wearing a crown.“We do not live in a kingdom,” she said. “It is important that we not lose sight of the underlying cause of these injunctions. It is not that these judges are ‘crooked’ or ‘lunatics’ or ‘evil.’ Those are words used by the president, it is because the administration is violating the constitution.   Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on March 18 issued a rare statement, pushing back against Trump’s suggestion that a judge who issued an injunction against an administration order face impeachment.“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”Jennifer Shutt contributed to this story.",,,,2025-04-02 18:05:13.626032

(Courtesy of Mandy Roman with Project Weber/RENEW)Rep. Jay Edwards expected opposition when he first pitched the idea of setting up medically supervised sites in Rhode Island where people could safely use illegal drugs. 
But in the four years since Edwards’ bill was signed into law, making Rhode Island the first state in the nation to authorize “harm reduction centers,” concern and misunderstanding has dissipated over what researchers and health care providers agree may help mitigate drug overdoses and deaths. Since opening in mid-January, the state’s first and only harm reduction center has drawn more than 500 visitors and prevented 27 overdose deaths, according to information from Project Weber/RENEW, the nonprofit that operates the south Providence site.
Which is why Edwards was caught off guard by the lengthy and fiery debate among his House colleagues Tuesday over a proposed two-year extension to the existing program, to March 1, 2028. 
“It kind of surprised me,” Edwards, a Tiverton Democrat, said in an interview Wednesday. “This is a law that is already in place and we already have a site up and running. They’re not going to take it down this minute.”
First state-regulated overdose prevention center could open by summer in Providence

The House ultimately approved the extension legislation by a 52-17 vote, with six members absent, following a 90-minute floor debate. The passionate debate centered not on whether the existing pilot program should be extended, and more on the criminal and health implications of offering a place for people to use illegal drugs at all.
“They were just rehashing the same issue that we already decided,” Edwards said in an interview Wednesday. “There was nothing novel about the opposition.”
He went on to characterize opponents’ proclamations as “grandstanding” and “playing to the cameras.”
Phrases like “sanctioned opium dens” and “Band-Aid approach” were invoked by opposing lawmakers of both political parties, who alleged that giving people a place to safely use drugs would drive up violence and criminal activity in the surrounding neighborhood.
The city of Providence has not received any police, fire or emergency management calls to the address of Project Weber/RENEW’s center near Rhode Island Hospital since the safe injection site opened this year, Anthony Vega, a city spokesperson, said in an email Wednesday. Data on 911 calls and arrests to other addresses surrounding the center were not immediately available.
How the center impacts visitors and the community, including police activity, is being studied by Brown University researchers.
More time = more data
Amendments to Edwards’ extension bill bolster program reporting requirements to include the number of people connected to other specialists for addiction treatment, and total overdoses prevented. Existing law requires state-authorized harm reduction centers to provide other health-screening and disease prevention resources by medically trained professionals.
Project Weber/RENEW relocated its headquarters to the south Providence building that houses the safe injection site, providing space for administrative work and other community health and support services, Roman said.
House Minority Whip David Place, a Burrillville Republican, supported the extension of the pilot program as a way to gather more data on its effectiveness, even though he said he “adamantly opposed” the original bill.
“We made a decision however many years ago to put this policy into effect,” Place said during the floor debate. “We owe it to ourselves to check it out and see how it works.”










We made a decision however many years ago to put this policy into effect. We owe it to ourselves to check it out and see how it works. 


– House Minority Whip David Place, a Burrillville Republican 


Mandy Roman, a spokesperson for Project Weber/RENEW, also stressed the importance of a longer operational period in an email Wednesday.
“We know firsthand that building trust, gathering meaningful data, and demonstrating impact takes time,” Roman said. “A longer pilot period is essential to fully evaluate the program’s effectiveness in saving lives and connecting people to care.”
Gov. Dan McKee, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley and the Mental Health Association of Rhode Island also wrote to lawmakers to back the extension bill.

Critics reemerge 
Rep. Pat Serpa, a West Warwick Democrat, pointed to the lack of buy-in from cities and towns except for Providence — the law requires city or town councils to formally vote to agree to host a harm reduction center — as evidence of the public opposition.
“If this is so virtuous, if this such a great idea, why don’t you propose this in your district,” said Rep. Jon Brien, a Woonsocket independent. “My suspicion is there will be somebody sitting in your seat after the next election?”
Yet Rep. José Batista, a Providence Democrat whose district includes the center operated by Project Weber/RENEW, supported the program, and the two-year extension. He acknowledged he was initially concerned.
“The shortest point that helped convince me was, if you don’t like safe locations, what about all the unsafe locations that exist right now: under bridges, in the dark,” Batista said.
Batista also argued that punitive measures to sanction illegal drug activity have historically failed. 
“Perhaps we should try something different, something backed by science and research and data,” he said. 










I am totally against drugs, but guess what, if these harm reduction centers save one person, what’s the value of that life? I’d give everything I have, everything I own to see my brother again. 


– Rep. Gregory Costantino, a Lincoln Democrat whose brother died due to substance abuse 


Drug-related overdoses in Rhode Island fell by 21% from 2023 to 2024, to 320 deaths, according to state health data. Illegal drugs, used alone or in combination with authorized prescription medications, continue to dominate, responsible for nearly 84% of drug-related overdose deaths in 2024. 
“We have to stop thinking people who use drugs are bad people and we have to stop shaming them,” said Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat. “We are not here as a legislative body to continue to shame people who go into these centers.”
State law specifies that harm reduction centers be funded by revenue from opioid settlement lawsuits. But several opposing lawmakers decried other costs associated with centers. Project Weber/RENEW, as a nonprofit, doesn’t pay property taxes, for example.
Rep. Charlene Lima, a Cranston Democrat, also questioned the burden on first responders, assuming that police and ambulance visits to the south Providence neighborhood had increased since Project Weber/RENEW opened its doors.
“Don’t tell me you think this is free and it’s just falling out of the sky,” Lima said. “That’s a load of baloney.”

When politics is personal 
Amid the rising tones and tensions, Rep. Gregory Costantino, a Lincoln Democrat, struck a noticeably subdued tenor as he shared a story about an unnamed pair of teenage brothers, the older of whom struggled with addiction to various drugs. 
“At 27 years old, I had to bury my brother,” Costantino said. “It devastated, devastated our family.”
The whispers in the chamber quieted as Costantino continued.
“I am totally against drugs, but guess what, if these harm reduction centers save one person, what’s the value of that life? I’d give everything I have, everything I own to see my brother again.”
Similar though not identical legislation in the Rhode Island Senate sponsored by Melissa Murray, a Woonsocket Democrat, would make the pilot program permanent. Murray’s bill remains under review by the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services following an initial hearing on March 4. A committee vote has not been scheduled, and potential amendments to Murray’s bill are still being reviewed, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, said in a text message Wednesday.



How they voted
Seventeen members of the House of Representatives voted against a bill to extend the state’s pilot safe injection program by two years. They are:

Rep. Jon Brien, a Woonsocket independent
Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat
House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican

“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

USDA pausing funding to Maine school programs over alleged Title IX violations


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday April 2, 2025 5:35 pm












The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation.
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said.

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday April 1, 2025 4:14 pm












The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

U.S. Department of Justice threatens to sue Maine


By: Maine Morning Star -  12:27 pm












In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title IX investigation


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:25 pm












On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 18:05:13.626032

Kelly Armstrong on Tuesday named interim state Labor Commissioner Zachary Greenberg to the position on a permanent basis. 
Greenberg has led the North Dakota Department of Labor and Human Rights as interim commissioner since January.
A native of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Greenberg earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Minnesota Crookston and his law degree from the University of North Dakota School of Law in Grand Forks. He worked as a law clerk at a private firm in 2022 and spent the next two years in the Governor’s Office serving as a legal and policy adviser.
“Zach has proven himself to be a capable leader these past few months, ensuring North Dakota’s labor and human rights laws are enforced in a fair and timely manner,” Armstrong said in a news release. 
The Department of Labor and Human Rights is responsible for enforcing North Dakota labor and human rights laws. The department licenses employment agencies in the state and can verify the status of independent contractor relationships.
Greenberg replaced Nathan Svihovec, who served under former Gov. Doug Burgum.
“Working together, we will continue to meet the needs of employees and employers, resolve disputes with neutrality and fairness, and treat all parties with empathy, patience, courtesy and respect,” Greenberg said in the release.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation. 
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools. 
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said. 
The funding freeze comes amid a barrage of actions targeting Maine following President Donald Trump and Mills’ heated exchange over the state’s protections for transgender student athletes.
Both the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services determined Maine’s polices allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports, which is supported by the Maine Human Rights Act, violate federal protections against sex-based discrimination in schools. Title IX does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls. 
Maine has not responded to the investigations. 
Last month, USDA preemptively froze millions in grant and research funding for the state’s public universities as it reviewed whether they were in compliance with Title IX and Title IV, which bans race-based discrimination. The agency later determined the University of Maine System to be in compliance, and funding was restored. 
The university system follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month after Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. Maine public schools are required to follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which includes gender identity as a protected class. That means students can use the pronouns and facilities aligning with their gender identity. 
Republican state lawmakers want gender identity to be removed from the Human Rights Act so that Maine can access federal funding. The Maine Principals’ Association, which governs school sports, also follows the state law and has so far declined to walk back trans’ students rights to participate in sports.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A state senator wants to more than double the staff for the North Dakota Ethics Commission, arguing the state should be doing more to prevent public corruption.
The amendment was brought before the House Appropriations Committee’s Education and Environment Division on Wednesday by Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo.
He said his proposal was prompted by news coverage of former Republican state Sen. Ray Holmberg’s prison sentence.
“It seems like every week, sometimes every day, there’s some sort of news story about our former colleague, Sen. Holmberg,” Mathern told lawmakers. 
Holmberg was sentenced to 10 years in prison last week after he pleaded guilty to traveling to Prague, Czech Republic with the intent to engage in commercial sex with minors. One of Holmberg’s trips to Prague was subsidized by taxpayer dollars, according to federal prosecutors. A prosecution sentencing memorandum also alleged that Holmberg arranged for commercial sex “on countless occasions” while traveling in the U.S.
Holmberg sexually exploited others, including people in North Dakota, witnesses say in court

Meanwhile, the Ethics Commission faces an unprecedented number of complaint filings. In mid-March, Executive Director Rebecca Binstock told lawmakers that the board had received 59 complaints since the beginning of the year. That’s more than the 41 filed in all of 2024.
Ethics staff have testified previously that they lack the legal authority and resources to process these complaints as quickly as they would like. 
Mathern said the state ought to do more to support the commission. He suggested adding four to five new staff members, which would cost North Dakota an additional $1.5 million for the 2025-2027 budget cycle. That would roughly double the size of its budget.
“It’s not just the fact that there are all these complaints,” Mathern said. He said not granting additional staff “will be damaging the Ethics Commission itself because it’s bogged down and can’t be really acting on much.” 
Under Mathern’s proposal, the commission would have three attorneys, an educational/communications administrator and a paralegal, in addition to an executive director. It would also include an operations manager and an administrative assistant.
The Ethics Commission currently has three staff members. The proposed budget for 2025-2027 already includes an additional employee for public education. 
Binstock said the commission hasn’t taken a stance on Mathern’s proposal, but that the commissioners do appreciate his support. She said the board’s priority for now is securing the education staff member.
Earlier in the session, the House rejected House Bill 1360, which sought to make changes the commission said would have helped it address bottlenecks in its complaint process.
The Attorney General’s Office and Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s Office testified against House Bill 1360, expressing concerns that some parts of the bill were unconstitutional. 
Mathern on Wednesday also brought up the new term limits for state lawmakers, which North Dakotans approved in a ballot measure in 2022. Under the constitutional amendment, many lawmakers will turn over in the coming years.
He said the commission will need more resources to ensure it can effectively educate new legislators. He noted that many current lawmakers are still confused about ethics rules.
Mathern also cited the need for more public education about the purpose of the commission.
“It’s coming at the late hour,” Rep. Mike Nathe, the committee’s chair, told Mathern. “I’m not knocking the idea, I’m just saying it looks like it would need more discussion.”
The committee didn’t take any action on the budget bill on Wednesday.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Despite concerns about vague language and potential impacts reaching beyond targets of the bill, an Iowa Senate subcommittee on Wednesday advanced legislation to establish statewide general education requirements for public universities.
House File 401, which passed out of the Iowa House of Representatives in mid-March, would require state universities to develop new general education standards for students, requiring study in English, math and statistics, natural and social sciences, the humanities, western and American heritage.
According to the legislation, these courses cannot “distort significant historical events or include any curriculum or other material that teaches identity politics or is based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, or privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States of America or the state of Iowa.” However, language directly after this section states course instructors’ academic freedoms and the free discussion of ideas in class will not be limited.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Keenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy at One Iowa, asked the subcommittee during public comment to strike the section of the bill including “identity politics,” due to the lack of a definition of the term and its vagueness. Under his interpretation of the bill language, Crow said instructors would not be able to teach students about the civil rights and women’s liberation movements or the Stonewall uprising.
“I understand that a lot of this leaves room for interpretation, and maybe folks don’t agree with my interpretation, but that’s kind of my point,” Crow said. “My interpretation is just as valid as yours. Since there’s no specificity, I don’t think that’s a positive thing for educational institutions.”
Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, agreed with Crow’s comments and added that with the current language stating instruction cannot be based on ideas that systemic oppression is inherent to U.S. institutions, teachers would also be prohibited from teaching about slavery or the time when women could not vote.
“The hypocrisy of this bill is blatant,” Quirmbach said. These two sentences are side by side … you have freedom of speech, you have academic freedom to talk about anything you want, as long as you don’t talk about things we don’t want you to talk about.”
Subcommittee chair Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said he doesn’t see anything in the legislation that would stop the teaching of the facts of U.S. history, including slavery and segregation. Since the bill puts its restrictions in the present tense, he said it only prohibits teaching the idea that systemic oppression is still inherent to U.S. institutions.
He concurred that the term “identity politics” should either be defined or removed from the bill, since it is broad.
“I know what it is, I know when I see it, but that’s different than putting it into Iowa code and specifying what it is,” Taylor said. “I think we have to have better guidance for the institutions.”
Representatives of community colleges and the Iowa Board of Regents shared concerns during the meeting that articulation agreements between colleges and universities would need to be reworked, as new standards would change what courses community colleges need to offer to ensure students are completing their general education before going to a four-year school.
Community Colleges for Iowa is registered as unopposed to the bill, and Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson said the board has changed its stance from “undecided” to “in favor,” as the House took many of the board’s suggestions in refining the bill.
Another concern Carlson reiterated from previous meetings was the different definitions of diversity, equity and inclusion listed in different pieces of legislation. Carlson asked for clarity on the issue.
Taylor said he understood the articulation agreements would need work if the legislation passes, which could pose problems, adding that he appreciated the addition of American and western history as general education requirements.
He and Sen. Julian Garrett, R-Indianola, signed the bill to move it to the full Iowa Senate Education Committee.
“It’s possible that the bill may need to be tweaked a little bit before it reaches the floor, but I would like to see the bill continue to move forward,” Taylor said.

House Bill 121 would restrict access to bathrooms based strictly on biological sex. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)A district court judge in Missoula on Tuesday temporarily blocked state officials from enforcing a new Montana law restricting access to public restrooms, changing rooms and sleeping spaces based on an individual’s sex assigned at birth.
Missoula District Court Judge Shane Vannatta’s ruling said a temporary restraining order on House Bill 121 is warranted and will preserve the status quo until the court can rule on a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court scheduled a hearing for April 21.
Gov. Greg Gianforte signed HB 121 last Thursday, praising the legislature’s speedy passage of a bill that safeguards “fairness, privacy and security for women and girls.”
The same day, the ACLU of Montana filed a lawsuit on behalf of five transgender and intersex individuals from across Montana who would be “immediately” impacted by the “terrible law,” according to the organization’s legal director, Alex Rate.
The Governor’s Office did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.
The law, introduced by Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings, applies to all public facilities and those that receive public funding, including correctional centers, juvenile detention facilities, local domestic violence programs, public buildings, and public schools. It includes leased public spaces and covers libraries, museums, hospitals, and university buildings.
In the suit, the five plaintiffs allege HB 121 violates their rights under the state constitution including “the rights to equal protection, privacy, to pursue life’s basic necessities, and due process.”
If implemented, the bill “would make it difficult, if not impossible, for transgender and intersex Montanans to participate in public life — to work, attend school, go to the courthouse or the Motor Vehicle Division, or visit a library or state park,” the complaint states, and essentially “excludes intersex people from these facilities altogether.”
The bill, Vannatta wrote, “is motivated by animus and supported by no evidence that its restrictions advance its purported purpose to protect women’s safety and privacy.”
But the law, along with another law barring transgender individuals from participating in sports aligning with their gender identity, have been priorities for the Republican majority in the Legislature, as seen by the bills’ swift passage through both chambers.
HB 121 was one of the first bills heard during the 69th Legislative session, and Gianforte also made it a major point in his State of the State speech in January.
Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said when the bill was signed that the measure represented a “common sense” victory and showed that “in Montana, we still believe in biological reality.”
Vannatta said the plaintiffs had shown “at least serious questions going to the merits” of their claims, and that they “are concretely harmed” by the law’s denial of access to facilities that align with their gender identity.
The order also states that intersex people, who do not fit the law’s definitions of male and female, “do not know whether they are permitted to use any sex-separated facilities at all.”
A hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for 1 p.m. on April 21 in the Missoula County Courthouse.

They lost two races that most everyone always expected them to lose. But cutting the margins of defeat in half from elections held just four months ago is giving them hope for 2026.
“These races should have never been competitive, but we outworked them,” Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said in a Zoom call Wednesday afternoon, referring to the candidacies of Democratic candidates Gay Valimont in Congressional District 1 and Josh Weil in Congressional District 6.
“We outraised them and we slashed their margins by more than half,” Fried added. “And they panicked. They had to call Daddy [Donald Trump], hosting emergency town halls, slashing last-minute cash and even sacrificing [New York U.S. Rep. Elise] Stefanik’s nomination [as U.N. ambassador] to protect their very slim majority.”
In CD1 in the Panhandle, former state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis defeated Valimont by 15 percentage points, 57%-42%. In Northeast Florida’s CD6, former GOP state Sen. Randy Fine defeated Weil by 14 percentage points, 57%-43%.

Democrats spent far more money in both races despite the fact that the districts rank among the most Republican in the state — Trump won both districts by more than 30 percentage points last November. Nevertheless, Weil’s 14-point loss to Fine was 18 points closer than Democrat James David Stockton got in losing to then-Republican incumbent Mike Waltz in the same district just five months ago.
Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power dismissed the Democrats’ spin, saying, “We took everything that the Democrats had and we gave it back, and we won by double-digits.”
“We won big in record numbers in Florida last time, and getting people to turn out to vote right after they delivered a big victory is always hard,” Power told Newsmax.
“Special elections in Florida have always been close. This wasn’t close, even though they spent millions and millions of dollars. The Florida GOP, our grassroots teams made 400,000 calls, knocked on thousands of doors, and I think that everyone was united to the fact that they wanted to send a message that President Trump needed Floridians to go support him in Washington, D.C., and they sent two great ones in Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine.”
Fried disagreed, saying that the Florida outcome “is a warning sign for Republicans in Florida and around the country, and it should send shivers to the spine of any Republican, in an R-plus-15 seat or below. There are no more safe seats in Florida.”
‘He repels people’
Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis saw the closer margin of victory for Fine on Tuesday was a reflection of his weakness as a candidate and not a referendum on the president’s first two months in office.

During an appearance in Ocala Wednesday morning, the governor bashed Fine as a “squish” for supporting the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act and for opposing his proposal on illegal immigration earlier this year (as did the majority of the GOP-controlled Legislature initially but they later approved a watered-down bill).
“So when people see that, our base voters don’t get excited about that,” DeSantis said.
“You’re not giving them a reason to go out and vote. And also the way that he conducts himself, he repels people. He repels people in the Legislature. They wanted to get him out of the Legislature so they asked me to put him up for Florida Atlantic [University] president. I did, and the whole board would have resigned rather than make him president,” he continued.
“So, it was unique problems with this candidate that was causing it to be a close race, and I think it was trending to be a lot closer. Then what happened was they put a lot of money in a Trump plus-30 seat. They shouldn’t have had to do, but they did. And then the president did a couple of tele-town halls where he said, ‘Listen, for my agenda, I need you to go out and vote.'”
Fine responded via X, writing, “A dying star burns hottest before it fades into oblivion. I’m focused on working with @realDonaldTrump to stop Democrats from taking this country backwards, not working with them. Let’s go.”
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin promised that the resources the party brought to the Florida races will continue into next year’s midterms.
“You’re going to continue to witness a level of aggressive investment in organizing from this DNC that’s unlike anything that we’ve done before,” he said on the Zoom call, organized by the DNC. “Last night’s special elections in Florida show Trump, Musk, and Republicans that they’re in trouble even in the reddest districts.”
Worthy investment?
The fact that Democrats spent so much money (Weil raised more than $10 million and Valimont more than $6 million) was mocked by Republicans but was controversial with some Florida Democrats, too, who questioned whether it was a worthy investment.
“There’s easily been 2x as much money donated in these races as donated to the FL Dem Party for voter reg since Obama12,” Tallahassee Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote on X Tuesday night. “Until people get excited about funding infrastructure, it’s going to be a long road back.”
Fried maintained that the money made a difference, even though her party came up short in both races.
“I heard Republicans say, ‘Well, it was a waste of money. They spent $20 million on these races and we still won.’ But they don’t understand this, these races, came down to the wire because we invested in them,” she said Wednesday.
“Put money into a strong ground game and organized in red counties like never before. Investment on the ground matters. Money spent in specials was largely on the ground, not TV,” she continued.
“So, don’t tell me Florida is too expensive. We have proven that we can raise the money and spend it wisely. … We put a down payment on our future, and we’re going to make Republicans pay for it in the long run.”

West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia House of Delegates has narrowly passed a bill that would allow the Legislature to set its own rules for disclosing public records. Delegates approved House Bill 3412 with a 58 to 42 vote Wednesday.
The bill, sponsored by House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, would exempt the Legislature from requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, if it adopts its own rules. Some of the discussion included concerns over FOIA requests bogging down the Legislative staff’s workload. 
A search of the Secretary of State’s Office’s FOIA database show that, so far this year, five FOIA requests have been made of the Senate and none had been made of the House of Delegates. 
Lawmakers who opposed the legislation included Del. Larry Kump, R-Berkeley, who said the bill was the subject of lots of feedback from his constituents. Some of the commentary was that lawmakers who support the bill should not campaign on transparency, and that the public has a right to know what delegates are doing. 
“Perhaps the best way I can say it is, I do not like this bill,” Kump said. “I do not like it. I do not like it at all. Foxes should not be guarding the hen house. I think this bill should fall.”
The Freedom of Information Act allows journalists, researchers and members of the public to obtain access to lawmakers’ emails, presentations and more that can shed light on how decisions are being made. The emails can reveal what lobbyists or special interest groups are involved in bill making. Some communications are exempt. 
Current state FOIA law does not differentiate between the state’s court system, the executive branch and the Legislature, Hanshaw told lawmakers when the Rules Committee took up the bill. He told Rules Committee members individuals often use FOIA to access drafts of bills that are never introduced. Hanshaw wants the House to write rules that make it clear to the public what is and is not a public record.
Ann Ali, deputy chief of staff and communications director for the House of Delegates, said previously that the intent of the bill is not to hide public records and that Hanshaw wants any legislative records currently available to the public to remain available to the public.
The bill states that the Freedom of Information Act stays in effect unless the Legislature enacts its own rules, said Del. Clay Riley, who presented the bill Wednesday. 
Dels. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, and Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, raised concerns about what recourse people who request information but don’t get it would have under a legislative rule. Under current law, the person could file a lawsuit for the information. 
Riley said he couldn’t answer the “hypothetical question,” because the rules have not been passed yet. 
Hansen said he had concerns about the bill. 
“There are no guardrails on the rulemaking process other than the fact that we vote on it,” he said. “We could pass a rule that’s similar to what the current statute is. We could pass a rule that’s very different and protects all of our records from public disclosure, and that’s not right. We should play by the same rules as everybody else in government.”
Riley disagreed with the assertion that the law is more transparent than legislative rules. He pointed to the House making available audio archives of committee meetings as examples of the House being transparent. 
“Every vote, every committee meeting, is open to the public,” he said. “You know, this is a process of where we have the ability to clarify in our rules of which we govern ourselves what is and what isn’t, a legislative record. All executive branch documents are not like all legislative branch documents, and for that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage.”
The bill will next go to the Senate for consideration.

Despite opposition from  medical, mental health, and legal experts, the Georgia Senate passed these [&#8230;]","Opponents of legislation that would place restrictions on transgender Georgians gathered across from the state Capitol in January. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAs the 2025 legislative session comes to a close, transgender Georgians continue to be  relentlessly targeted by state legislators, including with Senate Bill 30, Senate Bill 39, and Senate Bill 185, all of  which would restrict access to evidence-based medical care. Despite opposition from  medical, mental health, and legal experts, the Georgia Senate passed these bills, handing them off to the House for consideration. 
SB 39, a vaguely worded and wide-ranging bill, inserts lawmakers directly into the patient provider relationship. It would prevent access to any health care deemed “transition related” for more than half a million state employees and their dependents who rely on the State Health Benefit Plan, as well as others who receive care that is state funded. The breadth of its impact regarding state associated funding is unclear, and perhaps that is the  point, allowing its sweeping prohibition to be as widely applicable as possible. Likewise, what qualifies as “transition-related” care is similarly unclear, risking the restriction of  funds for a wide range of medical care. At a House Health Committee hearing on March 26,  when questioned about whether SB 39 would prevent access to mental health care, Sen.  Blake Tillery, the bill’s sponsor, stated “If not aligned with one’s sex at birth, then I think  yes.” 
To push through the myriad of anti-transgender legislation prior to the end of the session,  SB 39 has adopted language from SB 185, a bill that specifically prohibits gender-affirming  care for transgender adults who are incarcerated in Georgia, including medications that  were previously prescribed by their medical provider. To protect the health of transgender  individuals, we must prevent these bills becoming law. 
Ignoring Evidence-Based Medicine 
As medical and mental health providers, we believe all patients deserve access to high quality, evidence-based medical care. For many transgender people, gender-affirming  care is essential and lifesaving. Numerous studies demonstrate the indisputable benefits of gender-affirming care for transgender patients, including reduced symptoms of anxiety  and depression, less psychological distress, lower risk of suicidal thoughts, and better  interpersonal relationships. Every major medical and psychological association in the U.S.,  including the American Medical Association, the Endocrine Society, the American  Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association, among others,  recognize the evidence basis supporting the medical and psychological necessity of  gender-affirming care. These bills inappropriately insert legislators into medical decision making, infringing on the rights and well-being of transgender patients.
Taking away individuals’ access to gender-affirming therapies while in prison constitutes  cruel and unusual punishment and increases the likelihood of abuse and detrimental health consequences. Abrupt cessation or forced weaning of medically necessary,  ongoing treatment is a health risk. Physical effects of hormone withdrawal are  accompanied by psychological distress, which may manifest as anxiety, depression, and  suicidality. These bills risk the forced detransition of individuals who may have consistently taken gender-affirming hormone therapy for years. This physically and  psychologically damaging experience is unnecessary and profoundly harmful. 
Banning  care behind bars 
Transgender people often endure significant discrimination, economic insecurity and, in  some cases, homelessness. These vulnerabilities make it more likely that transgender  individuals will face criminalization and incarceration. Within the criminal legal system,  transgender people experience further marginalization and discrimination. It is common for transgender individuals to be dangerously and illegally placed in prison facilities  misaligned with their gender, increasing risk of harassment and violence. They are also  less likely to receive necessary services, including personal care items and essential  medical care. At least one in three transgender people in prisons and jails have reported  being sexually assaulted. The danger is much greater for transgender females, with almost  50% reporting harassment, physical violence, or sexual assault while incarcerated. These  statistics are likely an underestimate as some prison staff facilitate and perpetuate  violence towards transgender individuals, making it dangerous to report abuse. Often, the  only “protection” offered is solitary confinement, which exacerbates stigma and may  result in serious mental health consequences. 
The U.S. Department of Justice has determined that Georgia’s prisons fail to reasonably  protect incarcerated people from harm, violating their constitutional rights. SB 185 would prohibit the state from funding medically necessary gender-affirming therapies, including hormone therapy, for transgender people who are incarcerated. All people who are  incarcerated in Georgia have a right to medically necessary care, not only those deemed  deserving by state politicians. Multiple lawsuits brought against the Georgia Department  of Corrections as well as departments in several other states have resulted in courts ruling that transgender individuals who are incarcerated have a right to access gender-affirming  care. Prior discrimination lawsuits involving transgender people in Georgia have cost  taxpayers more than $4 million since 2015, including cases brought by transgender people  who were unable to access medical care while incarcerated. SB 39 and SB 185 run counter  to established precedent and medical expertise. This would not only worsen the health of transgender individuals in Georgia but also continue a track record of costly litigation paid  for with taxpayer dollars. 
Reject politicization of patient health care 
The bills are dangerous and discriminatory and create new problems for the state while addressing none. By dismissing medical expertise and interfering with  the patient-physician relationship, the Georgia Legislature once again seeks to make  Georgians’ health decisions for them. Lawmakers should devote their time and the state’s  resources to improving healthcare gaps currently impacting millions in our state. This  legislation targets the rights and wellbeing of transgender people, who are made  vulnerable by widespread societal stigmatization. Under the guise of fiscal responsibility, this paternalistic legislation seeks to politicize medical care at the expense of a marginalized patient population. It is incumbent upon all Georgians who respect a  patient’s right to make their own medical decisions with their physician and oppose state sanctioned discrimination against minoritized groups, to contact our state legislators and  urge them to oppose any legislative efforts to harm transgender Georgians.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Republican lawmakers are advancing legislation that would prohibit “diversity, equity, and inclusion” clauses in state contracts, adding the measure to the state budget as Democrats object to the late notice.
In an amendment added to the budget trailer bill, House Bill 2, Republicans on the House Finance Committee voted to block state agencies, towns, and school districts from entering into contracts that have provisions relating to DEI. 
According to the proposed law, DEI includes any program or policy “that classifies individuals based on race, sex, ethnicity, or other group characteristics for the purpose of achieving democratic outcomes.”
The law would prevent any public entity from taking action to “implement, promote, or otherwise engage” any programs or policies related to DEI, and it would block state funds from being spent on them.
It would also bar state agencies from entering into contracts with vendors that include any DEI-related provisions, and would require state agencies to submit a report by October of any current contracts it has that include those provisions.
Public schools would be prevented from DEI programs, including implicit bias training, and race-based hiring, and public schools would also need to conduct a review of all contracts that might contain those programs by October, according to the bill.
The bill emerged Monday as a last-minute amendment to the budget. The House Finance Committee is expected to vote Thursday on its final recommended version of the budget, which must be voted on by the full House on April 10. The two budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, will then move on to the Senate.
Democrats objected that the anti-DEI amendment, brought by Reps. Rich Nalevanko, of Alstead, and Joe Sweeney, of Salem, came too late in the process and should have received a full hearing in a policy committee. 
“I simply want to point out that if the public has not said already that they want input on big decisions such as this one, and they see again that this committee is going to go ahead and jam through on literally the last day something like this without proper notice, proper discussion, and input from the community, I think they are going to lose their confidence in this body,” said Rep. Laura Telerski, a Nashua Democrat. 
Democrats also said the language was overly vague and would likely be challenged in court, which they said would cost the state in legal fees. They argued the phrase “other group characteristics” is confusing and could be read to exclude contracts and programs meant to help people with disabilities.
A similar law, known by some as the “divisive concepts law,” was passed in 2021 and was also the subject of a lawsuit. That law was struck down by the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire in May 2024 for being unconstitutionally vague; the state has appealed the decision to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.
“Good attorneys will argue on their interpretations of the words, and then a judge will determine the outcome. And the last time we took that gamble, it cost the state of New Hampshire $3 million,” said Rep. Mary Hakken-Phillips, a Hanover Democrat, referring to the litigation costs brought by the divisive concepts law. “Are we going to do that again?”
The amendment nearly didn’t pass. In an earlier vote Tuesday afternoon, the committee voted down the amendment after two Republican representatives, Jess Edwards, of Auburn, and Brian Seaworth, of Pembroke, broke with their party to oppose it. 
At the time, Edwards said he was voting against the amendment on principle, since the amendment was introduced late and did not receive a proper hearing. But later in the day, Edwards and Seaworth reversed their votes and the committee passed the amendment. Neither explained their decision publicly, but Edwards said he supports the aim of the amendment.
Edwards criticized Southern New Hampshire University, a private institution, for a course that delves in part into why white-majority neighborhoods have better health outcomes than minority-dominant neighborhoods. 
“It’s that calling out of a demographic to assign a group characteristic that doesn’t make any sense when you put it back into individual terms. It causes one to think, ‘Aren’t we supposed to be judged by the content of our character and not of our skin?’” he said.
Republican House Finance Chairman Ken Weyler, of Kingston, dismissed concerns about the late filing of the amendment. He pointed to a broader push against DEI initiatives by the Trump administration, and said if New Hampshire did not pass the proposed law, it could see federal funding withheld. 
“We want to make sure that we don’t lose federal money because we have something in there that lot of us don’t support anyway,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/statehousemarchcloudy-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-04-02 18:05:13.626032

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa senators amended and advanced on Wednesday a House bill aimed at protecting private property rights from eminent domain.
House representatives passed the proposed legislation last week which combines a series of bills aimed at reforming the Iowa Utilities Commission and preventing the Summit Carbon Solutions’ pipeline from using eminent domain in the state. 
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeney, said the Senate subcommittee meeting on the issue was “long awaited.” 
Bousselot said his goal “has always been” to pass legislation that protected “all landowners” and not just those affected by certain projects, which he alleged House legislation over the past several years has done.
“House File 639, before us today focuses only on creating additional property rights for land impacted by potential hazardous liquid pipelines … but does not take into account all types of pipelines, transmission lines or power generation,” Bousselot said.
Bousselot proposed an amendment that would remove certain parts of the House bill and add language to “avoid” eminent domain by allowing a project to find voluntary easements outside of the original project corridor. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Bousselot said this would apply to “any project seeking eminent domain approval before the IUC, including pipelines, transmission lines and power generation.”
His amendment would also require the Iowa Utilities Commission to make, within one year, a decision on any project that is seeking eminent domain rights.
“By saying that decision needs to be made within one year, there’s plenty of time for fact finding, but it also means, like the court cases that are going on today, those court cases get to court faster,” Bousselot said. 
As passed from the floor, House File 639 would have: 

Increased the insurance requirements for a hazardous liquid pipeline to cover any damages to property and reimburse landowners for increases in their property insurance premiums due to the pipeline. 
Changed the definition of a common carrier, to require a hazardous liquid carrier to establish with “clear and convincing evidence” that it will transport a commodity. 
Required an Iowa Utilities Commissioner to be present at all proceedings.
Allowed any interested party, including lawmakers, to intervene in IUC proceedings.
Restricted the IUC’s ability to sanction intervenors 
Limited the length of a hazardous liquid pipeline permit to one 25-year term. 

Bousselot’s proposed amendment would strike the common carrier definition, permit limits, intervenor requirements and would adjust the insurance requirements. 
The amendment would add a requirement for the “lifetime” repair and replacement costs for drainage tile, crop loss and soil degradation. Under the proposed amendment landowners would also be able to request, and be granted, a new land representative. 
The amendment retains the requirement that a commissioner from the IUC be present at informational meetings and hearings, and the section on insurance requirements that hold operators responsible for damages caused by the projects. 
Some of the landowners said the contents of Bousselot’s amendment were “a surprise” and they questioned how the landowners outside of the corridor, or the area around a proposed eminent domain project, would be notified. 
Jake Highfill, on behalf of the American Petroleum Institute said the organization was in favor of the corridor change and that it was “common practice” for members of the institute in other states. 
Jake Ketzner, a lobbyist for Summit Carbon Solutions, urged lawmakers to vote against “any piece of legislation that changes the rules in the middle of a project.” 
Ketzner said the company has been suggesting the corridor change Bousselot proposed and appreciated the amendment, noting it would give the project a route forward in counties where it currently has 90-95% of easements secured. 
“If we have the ability to move off someone’s ground that does not want the project, currently, the only way to deal with that is restarting,” Ketzner said. “So we think what you’re suggesting makes a lot of sense.” 
Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, said he signed off on the bill in subcommittee because it was the “last train out of the station” on the private property rights issue, but he urged his colleagues to vote against the amendment, which he called a “tremendous change to the system.” 
Sen. Tony Bisignano, a Democrat from Des Moines, said he opposed the amendment because of its rushed nature, and because he felt it was not “solving property rights.”
“We haven’t had a time to talk with people, to step back and really look at it,” Bisignano said of the amendment. “These people deserve the debate on eminent domain and property rights. This is a consolation.”
He voted in favor of the amendment to “keep it alive” for floor debate, which he has pushed for earlier in the session via a failed amendment to chamber rules.
The committee voted to adopt the amendment.
“This amendment builds on the work that was found in House File 639, retaining some, adding a lot, but ultimately is a major, major addition to strengthening and protecting private property rights in Iowa,” Bousselot said.
The bill advanced to the Senate floor via a voice vote in favor. Bousselot said he intends to file an additional amendment on the floor dealing with communications.

(Courtesy of John Williams/MOFGA)A bipartisan effort to expand the rights of agricultural workers in Maine is back before the Legislature with a couple proposals on the table for a state minimum wage guarantee, overtime pay and other protections. 
“This legislation seeks to answer a question that has echoed for far too long in Maine and across our nation: How can we claim to value the labor of farm workers so essential to the food on our tables while continuing to exclude them from the most basic labor protections that every other worker is afforded?” said Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland).
The Legislature’s Labor Committee held a public hearing Wednesday for three bills that would establish a state minimum wage for agricultural workers and provide them with other rights that workers in Maine currently have including overtime pay and limits on mandatory overtime.
While those who for several years have championed this issue see it as a matter of equity, opponents argue the industry is already paying well over minimum wage while battling thin margins and federal uncertainty. This comes after some agriculture sector leaders shared their concerns Tuesday about the financial toll new tariffs from the Trump administration could take on their operations. 
Currently, agricultural workers are excluded from Maine’s wage and hours law. Legally, they are only entitled to the $7.25 federal minimum wage; however, many farm owners say they pay workers even more than Maine’s minimum wage of $14.65 an hour. 
Talbot Ross told the committee that those exclusions are the legacy of policies meant to penalize people of color. Though she emphasized that no current lawmaker is responsible for those policies, she said the state must confront that history and make a deliberate choice to do better.
She also urged the committee to advance legislation that would grant farmworkers “full” dignity, value and worth in statute. Passing legislation that does not provide agricultural workers with equal protection that other workers enjoy is not justice, she said. 
“I’m urging you not to take an easy political road and find concessions and bring only half measures of justice to this industry and to these workers,” she told the committee.
Labor advocates call Gov. Mills’ veto of her own farmworker wage bill ‘an embarrassment’

Last session, Gov. Janet Mills introduced a proposal that would have guaranteed that agricultural workers would be paid at least $14.15 an hour and have the same annual cost-of-living increases provided to other hourly workers. The bill also included expanded recordkeeping requirements for employers. 
But Mills said the Legislature made changes that left her with no other option than to veto her own bill. It wasn’t the first time Mills vetoed such a proposal. In fact, her bill was born out of recommendations from the Agricultural Worker Minimum Wage Committee, which Mills formed after vetoing similar legislation in 2023.
Minimum wage
Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), who sponsored LD 357, said he was appalled by the governor’s veto last session. His bill is identical to the one the labor committee supported last year, whichMills said she couldn’t sign off on because it would have allowed workers to take private action against their employer for wage violations, whereas her original proposal stipulated that farmworkers go through the Department of Labor to bring an action against their employer. 
On Wednesday, Bennett stood firm in his belief that agricultural workers should be entitled to a private right of action, saying that relying on the government to defend someone’s rights defies American tradition. A private right to action was a key discussion point during the public hearing, as committee members sought to gain clarity on what statute currently affords farm workers. 
“There are no careers as vital to each of us, our families and our communities as the agricultural sector,” Bennett said. “It is true what they say: No farms, no food.”
However, multiple farmers and agricultural trade associations, including those for wild blueberry, potato, dairy and apple farms, opposed the bills over concerns about their financial impact, saying that those changes could kill their farms. Many of them also said they already pay their workers somewhere between $18 and $25 an hour, well above the state’s minimum wage.

For nearly all Maine workers — except farm workers — laws regarding wages, overtime, breaks and other such stipulations are located in the same part of state statute. Those can be found in Subchapter 3 of Chapter 7 of Title 26 of the Maine Revised Statutes, commonly referred to simply as Subchapter 3.
Rather than add farm workers to that subchapter, Bennett’s proposal creates a new section of law to house agricultural worker minimum wage. Farm employers have previously pushed for this approach, arguing that any future amendments to Subchapter 3 might fail to account for the industry nuances. 
Bennett’s bill would also require employers to keep records of the hours worked by each employee and the wages paid to them. It additionally spells out penalties for unpaid minimum wages and what employees can do about it.
The Departments of Labor and Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry testified neither for nor against the bill. Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman said the administration “firmly supports” ensuring that agricultural workers earn at least the state’s minimum wage, but suggested it may be more inclined to support a bill mirroring Mills’ proposal from last year that was not heard Wednesday but is expected to be coming down the pike.
Overtime and concerted activity
Talbot Ross took a different approach than Bennett to farmworker rights with LD 589. Rather than creating a new section of the law — which the former Speaker of the House said invokes the separate but equal legal doctrine that was used to perpetuate discrimination — her bill removes the language that exempts agricultural workers from the current minimum wage law. 
The proposal also includes overtime protections and a phased in overtime wage for agriculture employees. 
While the Department of Labor is neither for nor against, Commissioner Amanda Beal from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry opposed the bill. She said overtime is “economically impossible” for farmers, arguing that they would end up reducing workers’ hours to avoid having to pay an overtime wage. 
This argument was repeated by multiple farmers, who said that the seasonal work doesn’t lend itself to the same overtime regulations of other industries. With labor already the biggest expense for most farms, they also feared that having to pay more could decimate bottom lines. 
Talbot Ross’ other bill, LD 588, would give agricultural employees the right to engage in certain concerted activity, which includes talking about wages, working conditions and other employment matters with other employees or the employer.
This is similar to a bill introduced last session that ultimately split the committee along party lines. 
While her proposal didn’t go so far as to give farm workers the right to unionize, Talbot Ross said she would be OK with the committee reworking the bill to include that power.
The Maine AFL-CIO was generally in favor of the proposals, but described LD 588 as a compromise. All three of the bills were also supported by the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition, Maine Equal Justice, Maine Center for Economic Policy and Pine Tree Legal Assistance. 
The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association backed Bennett’s bill, as well as the concerted activity proposal. Deputy Director Heather Spalding said the organization is generally supportive of LD 589, but would like to work with the committee to make that more tenable for farmers and other stakeholders.

While the Maine Farm Bureau is opposed to all the bills, it supports the recommendations that shaped Mills’ proposal last year. The Maine State Chamber of Commerce is also opposed.

Phil Murphy said New Jerseyans deserve stronger safeguards against rapidly evolving threats in the virtual realm.,"Gov. Phil Murphy with Francesca Mani, a Westfield High School junior whose advocacy against deepfakes helped inspire state legislation, at a bill signing event in Newark on April 2, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Murphy’s office)Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation Wednesday imposing civil and criminal penalties on anyone who makes or shares deceptive AI-generated media known as deepfakes.
Murphy at an event in Newark said New Jerseyans deserve stronger safeguards against rapidly evolving threats in the virtual realm.
“Just about any bad actor can use artificial intelligence to produce hyper-realistic images and videos that can exploit children, teenagers, and, frankly, anyone,” he said.
The new law makes producing and sharing deepfakes a third-degree crime if they are used for an unlawful purpose — say, to harass or extort someone — with fines up to $30,000 or a maximum of five years in prison. The governor was joined Tuesday by Lt. Gov Tahesha Way and advocates like Francesca Mani.
Mani, a Westfield High School student who was a target of sexually explicit deepfakes shared by peers, helped inspire the legislation. She was recently named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in AI.
Mani said the boy responsible for the deepfakes featuring her likeness was given a one-day suspension, with school officials telling her there was not much more they could do because “there are no AI laws.”
“My response: Then I’ll bring you a law. Well, Westfield High School, this one’s for you. Doing nothing is no longer an option, Ms. Asfendis,” she said, referring to the school’s principal.
The measure first passed through the Legislature and landed on the governor’s desk in January, but Murphy conditionally vetoed it over concerns about its constitutionality. Lawmakers amended it and that version passed unanimously in the Senate and by a 64-13 vote in the Assembly.
Way, who also serves as the New Jersey secretary of state and oversees the state’s elections, warned of artificial intelligence’s potential to erode public trust during election campaigns. State Attorney General Matt Platkin also emphasized the office’s role in holding bad actors accountable, calling deepfakes a “powerful tool for deception when used maliciously.”
“Together we are building a future where tech serves the public good, not those who seek to undermine it,” said Way.
New Jersey is joining a growing number of states seeking to regulate deepfakes, particularly in areas of online harassment and election security. At least 20 states enacted laws last year to regulate political deepfakes.

StebbinsIn line with President Donald Trump’s executive order instructing the United States Army Corps of Engineers to exercise emergency permitting power to facilitate the nation’s energy supply, the Corps’ Great Lakes and Ohio River Division has authorized the use of special emergency processing procedures, as opponents of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline warn against placing the company’s controversial tunnel project on the fast track. 
Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline stretches from northern Wisconsin to Sarnia Ontario, carrying more than 22 million gallons of light crude oil and light synthetic crude through the Straits of Mackinac daily. 
In 2018, the pipeline was dented in three places by an anchor strike. Enbridge later agreed to replace a four-mile section of the dual pipelines running through the Straits of Mackinac with a new segment housed in a concrete-lined tunnel located in the bedrock beneath the lakebed in order to contain any potential oil spills. 

However, opponents have continued to call for a shut down of the pipeline, raising concerns about how construction would impact nearby wetlands and warning the pipeline’s contents carry risks for explosion within the tunnel, leading to a spill.
In February, members of the anti-Line 5 coalition Oil and Water Don’t Mix raised alarms that the project would be expedited under Trump’s executive order. The Coalition argued this move would undermine the extended environmental review the Corps is conducting for the project.

In order for the tunnel project to begin construction, it must receive permits from three agencies, the Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or USACE. 
In 2023, the Army Corps of Engineers announced it would extend its environmental review for the tunnel project, with plans to issue a draft environmental impact statement this spring. With the Corps’ website previously listing the project for emergency permit consideration, Oil and Water Don’t Mix has called on the USACE to maintain its full environmental review process, ensure meaningful opportunities for public participation and reject any efforts to classify the project as an emergency in need of expedited review.
On Monday, the Corps’ Great Lakes and Ohio River Division announced each of its seven districts is authorized to use special emergency processing procedures, including the Detroit district overseeing the permitting process for the tunnel project. 
The USACE’s website no longer lists the project among those under consideration for emergency permitting. At the time of publication the Corps lists the efforts as pending review for its environmental impact statement. It has not announced whether it will move forward with the permit for the tunnel project using emergency processing provisions.
Debbie Chizewer, a managing attorney at Earthjustice, which has opposed Enbridge in several cases involving Line 5, said they were not surprised to see the Corps is moving forward with an emergency process.
However, neither the executive order nor emergency provisions excuse the Corps from complying with the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act, Chizewer said. 
“If the Corps advances the Line 5 tunnel project through this process, we expect them to comply with the law. The truth is there is no national energy emergency, and even if there was, Line 5 is a pipeline that transports Canadian oil primarily to Canada. It will not affect the US energy supply. The state of Michigan can still do the right thing and reject permits for this dangerous project,” she said. 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States has led the globe in oil production since 2018. 
Carrie La Seur, the legal director for For Love of Water, or FLOW, which advocates for the protection of the Great Lakes, similarly said that an emergency declaration is not carte blanche for the corps to ignore environmental law. 
She noted Trump’s executive order relies on the National Emergencies Act, which requires periodic Congressional review and has a two-year sunset, alongside other emergency powers that require agency heads to make findings.
“Use of those emergency powers could be challenged as arbitrary and capricious (arguing that the alleged energy emergency is a sham) under the federal Administrative Procedure Act,” La Seur said in an email to the Advance. 
She also pointed to a breakdown of Trump’s executive order from Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, which notes that federal pipeline safety laws allow waivers based on certain findings, leaving an opening for legal challenges. 
When asked if the company had received any updates from the USACE on whether the tunnel project would be subject to emergency processing, Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy directed the Advance to a previous statement, where he emphasized that the pipeline is critical energy infrastructure.
“The State of Michigan has provided its environmental permits for the project, and the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC) has approved placing the new pipeline segment in a tunnel as Line 5 crosses the Straits of Mackinac. However, after nearly five years, the project still awaits action by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on an environmental impact statement and a permitting decision,” Duffy said. 
Enbridge has already received a permit from the Michigan Public Service Commission, which was upheld by the Michigan Court of Appeals after the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi challenged the decision alongside several environmental and clean water groups.

Although EGLE granted Enbridge’s tunnel project permits in 2021, the company must redo its water resources permit as part of a legal agreement with the department and the Bay Mills Indian Community. EGLE Strategic Communications Advisor Scott Dean told the Michigan Advance Wednesday that EGLE is currently reviewing two applications for construction activities related to the tunnel, including a joint permitting application covering its Wetlands Protection and Great Lakes Bottomlands permits. 
EGLE is also considering Enbridge’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, with its current permit set to expire on Oct. 1, 2025. This permit aims to protect water quality by imposing limits on the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a body of water.

While momentum builds at the city level — with Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Diego exploring similar laws — statewide bans have been slower to emerge.
The legislation targets tools such as RealPage’s YieldStar, which uses landlord-shared data to recommend rent increases — a practice critics say worsens unaffordable housing. Stateline reported last year that the algorithms have drawn increasing oversight attention as the country continues to wrestle with an affordable housing crisis.
“This wave of action shows that local governments are stepping up where federal enforcement takes time,” said Ivan Luevanos-Elms, executive director of Local Progress, the national network helping coordinate these efforts.
In 2024, proposed legislation failed to prohibit the use of these algorithms stalled in  Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.
Washington state has seen the most movement, with a proposed ban passing the Senate and awaiting a House vote. Colorado’s House approved a similar bill this week, and it’s now headed to the Senate.
Elsewhere, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation to ban algorithmic rent-setting tools, while Oregon lawmakers are considering an expansion of city-level bans. Lawmakers in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Georgia, New Hampshire, Hawaii have introduced bills, but none has advanced.
The legislative surge follows lawsuits against RealPage and six major landlords, accused by the U.S. Department of Justice and 10 state attorneys general of collusion and anticompetitive practices. But with court cases expected to drag on for years, cities are opting for faster action.
Still, these bans have met resistance from real estate and landlord groups. In Oregon, landlords and property managers argue the software helps manage rentals more efficiently.
“Without these tools, we must rely on outdated methods,” said Oregon landlord Aaron Douglas in submitted testimony. “This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a step backward.”

Allen Chesser (R-Nash) discusses a child welfare bill (Photo: Lynn Bonner)Marcella Middleton was in and out of foster care from ages 2 to 21, with more than 16 placements in North Carolina alone. 
She was at the Legislative Building on Wednesday speaking in support of a bill she thinks would have helped shorten her stay in the foster care system. 
A social worker “took adoption off the table” for her, Middleton said. “I had no avenue to advocate for myself.”
A bipartisan bill seeks to shore up some of the weaknesses in the state’s child welfare system through a multi-pronged effort focused on more efficiently moving children out of foster care and into permanent homes and helping prevent them from remaining in unsafe homes.
“What we are focused on in this bill are the life outcomes for children, so we are focused on an environment that is conducive to permanency and reunification, when possible,” said Rep. Allen Chesser (R-Nash), the bill’s lead sponsor. 
The state Department of Health and Human Services sets child welfare policies, but it’s the responsibility of counties to administer them. The decentralized system leads to variations in county operations and decisions. 
“With 100 counties doing it 100 different ways, it makes it very difficult to have standardization of service, standardization of care, standardization of mental health across North Carolina,” said Rep. Donnie Loftis (R-Gaston). “Hopefully, this bill starts the process of getting us all on the same page.”
Under the bill:

County social services directors would have to tell people who report child abuse or neglect within five days whether the office of child protective services is checking into the allegations and reasons for the decisions. People who report child abuse would be able to ask the state to review county decisions when directors decide not to follow up. 
Parents would no longer have their parental rights terminated for failure to pay for the care of their children while the children are in county custody. 
Before representing county social services agencies, lawyers would have to take six hours of mandatory specialized training. The training would be required each year. 
Open adoptions would be allowed, if both the adoptive parents and birth parents agree. Courts would be able to modify or terminate the agreements. The agreements would end when children turn 18 or are otherwise emancipated. 
Foster parents or relatives who have cared for children for at least a year and want to adopt them would have the chance to talk to judges before child care workers remove the children for a new placement. 
The state Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) would be able to review open and closed cases in counties as part of regular monitoring or in response to complaints. County Department of Social Services directors would be notified of violations of rules and laws. If the problems aren’t remedied, the state would ask the county boards of commissioners, county managers, and other county officials to fix the problems. 

Foster agency operators, advocates for foster children, foster parents, and representatives from Disability Rights NC and DHHS attended the presentation of the bill. 
Lisa Cauley, director of the DHHS Division of Human Services gave a rundown of recent and soon-to-be operational advances in child welfare. 
“To truly protect children and strengthen families, we have more work to do,” she said. “This bill is a big step in moving us forward. First and foremost, it creates a new level of accountability in the child welfare system.”
It would also help smooth the path toward permanent, stable homes for children, she said.

Multiple parties must work together to ensure permanency for children, Cauley said. “This bill brings these systems together around the shared goal of reducing delays and securing permanency to move children out of DSS custody as safely and quickly as possible.”
Absent an immediate crisis, sweeping changes to the state’s child care system have been difficult and slow.
Chesser said the bill took about 16 months to develop. 
“It is something that a lot of blood, sweat and tears, and I would say love has been poured into,” he said. “Our goal here is to overcome some of the political obstacles we have faced in the past and actually move the needle for the children who need it the most, and that is the children who are in foster care.”
Middleton is now CEO of the nonprofit A Way Home America, which advocates for federal policies to reduce youth homelessness. 
The bill’s provisions would have helped her, she said, and would help the young people she works with today.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Breast cancer is among the most common cancer diagnoses in Rhode Island, making up about 13% of diagnoses each year as well as 7% of all cancer deaths.
Early detection can make a difference. South Kingstown Democratic Rep. Kathleen Fogarty is sponsoring a bill that she hopes will make mammograms, which can help with early detection, more accessible and affordable by prohibiting insurers from levying out-of-pocket costs for the diagnostic tests. 
“Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed and leading killer of Black women,” Fogarty said. “Despite a lower incidence rate, Black women have a 38% higher mortality rate than white women, which I think is just disgraceful. So we really need to help out all women.” 
According to the state health department, more than 91% of women diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time live at least five years after being diagnosed. 
Fogarty knows firsthand the value of early detection.
“I will share with you that I was just diagnosed with early uterine cancer, and I am actually going in tomorrow for surgery,” Fogarty told the crowd gathered in the State House Library on Tuesday. “So when doctors tell you, if you have any bleeding in your postmenopausal, make sure you go back to your doctor, because that’s what I did.” 
Fogarty shared her experiences as a featured speaker at the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) advocacy day at the statehouse.   
“I had a sister who’s a nurse who stayed on top of me, and hopefully we’re going to get it early enough, but tomorrow I go in for surgery,” Fogarty continued. “I am with all of you in your fight against cancer here in Rhode Island.”
Uterine cancer, when detected early, has a five-year survival rate of 95%, according to the National Cancer Institute. Averaged across different demographics and stages of disease severity, over 80% of diagnosed patients live for at least five years from diagnosis. Still, disparities exist in how cancer is diagnosed and treated, something Fogarty pointed to in her remarks.  
The same applies to other forms of cancer, too. Uterine cancer mortality rates, for instance, decreased for decades until rising across all demographic groups, according to a 50-year, population-based analysis published in 2023 in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women ages 30 to 39 had the highest annual increases, at 3.3% and 3.8% respectively, in uterine cancer mortality from 2001 to 2018, the study noted. 
Fogarty’s bill — along with its twin in the Rhode Island Senate, Bill S0197 by Providence Democratic Sen. Sam Zurier, is one of three lobbied for by the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network in Rhode Island this year. The ACS estimates that 7,500 Rhode Islanders will receive cancer diagnoses this year, and it predicts 2,100 people in the state will die from the disease.  
“We should be making it easier, not harder, for Rhode Islanders to afford medications, screenings, treatments that they need,” Ryan Timothy Strik, ACS CAN’s government relations director in Rhode Island, said Tuesday.
A third bill, this one from East Providence Democratic Sen. Robert Britto, would essentially force insurance companies to deduct copay assistance payments from patients’ deductibles for medications. 
That would help Paul Adam, an American Cancer Society volunteer who told the crowd about his experience with the expensive biologic drugs. Biologics are derived from living organisms and often carry special handling and storage requirements. They have been a major driver of pharmaceutical development in the past two decades, and are used in a variety of hard-to-treat conditions, from cancers to autoimmune disorders like arthritis — an ailment for which Adam said he gets shots twice monthly.   
The drugs also tend to be expensive: Adam said his copay is $2,400 until his deductibles are met.
“Fortunately, I’ve been able to benefit from copay assistance, which essentially covers my copay in full,” Adam said. “However, my insurance company stepped in. Without notice, they stopped applying my copay assistance to my deductible, all because it was coming from a third party.”
Drug manufacturers have long offered copay assistance programs to offset the cost of the expensive drugs they manufacture. Insurers have retaliated in recent years by leveraging tools like copay accumulators. A 2024 review in the Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy broke it down like this: Under a manufacturer assistance program, an insurer might pay $16,000 and the manufacturer $8,000 for a drug that costs $24,000 a year. With a copay accumulator in place, the cost might be split evenly between patient, manufacturer and insurer, at $8,000 apiece.
This is the third year Adam has rallied for the bill. 
“I find myself with significant medical debt after three years, and more recently, had to go without my medication for six months,” Adam said. “People shouldn’t have to choose between paying their bills, putting food on the table and affording medications or screenings or treatments.”
Cancer doctors have also expressed dissatisfaction with the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) used by insurers to dispense and manage prescriptions for specialty drugs like biologics or newer cancer treatments. In a 2024 survey from Oncology News Central, 50% of the oncologists surveyed said they strongly supported legislation that would regulate PBMs ability to deliver cancer drugs.  
All three bills have been heard in committee hearings in their respective chambers as of Tuesday, and all three have been held for further study, as is standard practice for bills when first introduced.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Holdout states consider expanding Medicaid — with work requirements

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.












Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families




Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

Jeff Landry has enacted a hiring freeze for the executive branch of state government in an effort to save $20 million ahead of a projected state budget shortfall. 
The governor signed an executive order Wednesday that pauses hiring for state government departments and agencies under the governor’s control. The order does not apply to Louisiana’s judicial or legislative branches, according to Landry’s press secretary Elizabeth Crochet.
“To ensure the long-term fiscal health of Louisiana and protect essential services for our most vulnerable citizens, we must take decisive action now to address revenue shortfalls,” Landry said in a written statement. “By implementing a temporary hiring freeze, we will reign in spending, saving an annualized $20 million. This is a necessary step to give the Legislature more options, to prevent deeper cuts to health care and education, and to safeguard the future of our state.” 
Landry and state lawmakers looked to avoid a budget crunch during a special legislative session on taxes and state spending in November. They increased the state sales tax from 4.45% to 5%, effective through fiscal year 2029, and state income tax rates were lowered to a flat 3% for individuals and 5.5% for corporations.
The governor and legislators also agreed to put a constitutional amendment before voters that would have shifted certain revenue streams into the state general fund. 
In December, legislators were shown revenue projections that indicated their actions would stave off a budget deficit. That money would have likely helped address the shortfall that Landry now predicts.
But that was before voters resoundingly rejected Amendment 2 in Saturday’s election, which would have moved money from state’s savings accounts in the general fund, where it could be more easily spent.  
In addition to the failed amendment fallout, the Landry administration may have to cope with federal funding cuts that will impact the state spending plan for the 2025-26 fiscal year.

The stark differences in their budgets will need to be reconciled over the next few weeks. The two chambers will formally vote out their budgets next week.
The House-proposed budget adds up to nearly $113 billion while the Senate spending plan is nearly $117.4 billion — both less than the $118.6 billion being spent in this fiscal year’s budget. Those figures include total spending, including federal funds. 
The main reason for the wide gap is that the House wants to trim spending now and return dollars leadership claims don’t need to be spent. To that end, the House wants to cut the state’s sales taxes by roughly $5 billion — a move that if ultimately approved would cut levies Floridians pay on a wide array of goods, ranging from non-food items they buy at the grocery store to cars, but leave less to spend on programs.
“We must remove the temptation to spend,” said Rep. Lawrence McClure, chair of the House Budget Committee.
Both budget plans drew criticism for their cuts to support for access to accelerated courses at public schools, Everglades restoration, and state employees. Senate Appropriations Chairman Ed Hooper noted that state employees “will be one of the bigger issues in conference that we’re going to have to deal with.”

Drugs and money
One glaring difference when it comes to state employees is that the Senate plan includes a 4% pay increase. The House budget doesn’t include money for pay raises. “The Senate budget recognizes the importance of our state employees,” Hooper said.
The House budget eliminates positions that have been vacant for more than 90 days. The House budget funds 106,780 positions. The Senate budget also eliminates vacant positions but maintains authority for the agencies to hire those employees. The Senate budget funds 112,842 positions.
The House proposes a strict drug formulary for employees using their state insurance coverage — a move that one House Republican predicted could save $126 million.
But it was the chambers’ conflicting positions on education funding that drew the most attention, both in public testimony and discussion among the members.
Both chambers would increase bottom-line spending on education from the near-$28.6 billion being spent today. The House earmarks $29.33 billion, while the Senate version is $29.57 billion.
Most of the debate in the House committee Wednesday focused on changes the chamber would make to financing for educational options. The chamber’s proposed budget would reduce financial incentives to schools by half for every student who passes advanced placement tests, take dual-enrollment courses, or receive certifications for international baccalaureate courses.
In the current year, schools receive $865 for each student who passes an AP exam. 
Students from Rickards High School, where Leon County’s IB program is located, shared how the program changed their lives and opened opportunities for them at colleges like Cornell and Dartmouth.
Following their testimony, House Budget Committee Vice Chair Susan Valdés counseled patience.
“We heard you. This is just in the committee process,” said Valdés, who switched parties from Democratic to Republican after winning reelection in November. “This is a proposed piece of legislation — this is what’s proposed and then we go from there. So, this is not the end product. Ok? So, your voices have been heard.”
The Senate proposes reducing the funding for passing the tests by 50%, too, although schools would keep the money for other needs, if desired. Sen. Danny Burgess, chair of the  education budget subcommittee, said the Senate version is “better aligning additional program costs for advanced courses with funding provided through the bonus FTE.”
He referred to the state’s per-student financial support for public schools.










We must remove the temptation to spend.


– House Budget Committee Chair Rep. Lawrence McClure


What about taxes?
The budget represents just part of the state’s financial picture. Taxes are another. House Speaker Daniel Perez and Gov. Ron DeSantis both want to return at least $5 billion to taxpayers but disagree sharply over how to do that. Senate President Ben Albritton has refrained from embracing either side so far and is taking a more cautious approach.
Perez wants to permanently roll back the state’s sales tax from six cents on the dollar to 5.25%. DeSantis wants to eliminate property taxes next year, via a constitutional amendment placed before voters in 2026, and, in advance of  that, provide an average $1,000 rebate to the 5.1 million homesteaded properties across Florida.
“These are both significant ideas, worthy of our thought and consideration,” Albritton told his senators this week in an open letter. “However, at this point, I believe it is prudent that a final tax cut package of this size be predominantly nonrecurring, while permanent tax cuts are explored during the interim.” “Nonrecurring” means the cut would be for one year only.
The House Ways and Means Committee, meanwhile, passed the Perez tax plan unanimously on Wednesday.
Bridge the gap
While the budgets are about $4.4 billion, apart the Senate has included $200 million in a separate bill for Albritton’s “Rural Renaissance” initiative, intended to boost economies in less developed sections of Florida. That means there’s a $4.6 billion difference in proposed funding between the chambers.
The spending gap must be bridged before legislators can begin fine-tuning the budget.  Although legislators discuss hundreds of bills each session, the budget, known as the General Appropriations Act, is the only bill legislators are required to pass each year. 
Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment imposing a 72 hour “cooling off period” on the budget with the goal of allowing members time to go through the document and read the fine print. The 72-hour requirement means that the spending plan must be printed and put on members desks by April 29 if they hope to adjourn on time on May 2.

Roger Marshall of Kansas is keen to convince Congress to restore whole and 2% milk as an option for children in school cafeterias nationwide.,"U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, pours a serving of milk during a Senate committee hearing to demonstrate his desire  to return whole and 2% milk to school cafeterias. Currently, students had the option of drinking 1% or skim milk. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Marshall's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall opened a Senate committee hearing by throwing back a glass of milk to emphasize the value in altering U.S. Department of Agriculture directives so alternatives to low-fat milk could be served to school children.
“If you could just spare me a moment here, I’ve got to clear my throat a little bit,” said Marshall, while pouring milk from a small carton into a glass and gulping most of it down. “There, I can speak better now.”
Marshall, a Kansas Republican with a pre-politics career as a physician, said members of Congress often had personal reasons for seeking federal office. Marshall said he arrived in Washington, D.C., with a 10-point priority list.
“Save the world. Save Medicare. Save Medicaid. Balance the budget. And, get whole milk back in schools,” he said.
Marshall, a self-described milk lover with fond memories of consuming farm-fresh milk in Kansas, reveled Tuesday at the opportunity to repeat his December 2023 milk-drinking performance for the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing on legislation rolling back USDA restrictions on school milk options.
  Eve Stoody, director of nutrition guidance and analysis division at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said during a U.S. Senate hearing a federal dietary review panel recommended milk consumption in schools remain tied to 1% and skim varieties rather than resume distribution of whole or 2% milk. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall’s YouTube channel)
 
It’s about the fat
Marshall said whole milk, which contained 3.25% fat, and reduced-fat 2% milk should be presented to children in schools along with the low-fat 1% milk and fat-free skim milk.
In 201o, Congress directed the USDA to ban whole and 2% milk in schools by modifying dietary guidelines to limit options to skim or low-fat cartons.
Supporters of USDA policy implemented in 2012 contended whole or 2% milk was higher in saturated fat and contributed to elevated cholesterol levels or increased risk of heart disease. One cup of whole milk could contain 4.5 grams of saturated fat, which covered a substantial portion of recommended daily intake for school-aged children. In addition, skeptics of whole milk said the intake of saturated fat could contribute to rising levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children. 
Eve Stoody, director of nutrition guidance and analysis division at USDA, said federal dietary guidelines recommended plain whole milk for infants under 2 years of age before transitioning to lower-fat milk options.
“There’s a bit of an evidence gap as to exactly when that transition to lower fat options might be most beneficial, but there’s definitely benefits of plain whole milk, particularly in young children, to supporting brain development,” Stoody said.
She said it was “very concerning” consumption of fluid milk began to decline in the early 2000s and current consumption in adolescence was about half a cup lower per day than it was two decades ago. Increasing milk consumption among U.S. youth would be a positive development, she said, and the best path would be through lower-fat options.
“Dairy is a healthy choice,” Stoody said, “but it really matters what you’re eating with that dairy. For those who eat a healthy diet, for those who are active … whole milk can be a great option.”
She said a federal dietary review panel recommended policy on milk consumption in schools remain unchanged for 2025-2030. The final standard would be determined by USDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Robert Kennedy Jr., secretary of HHS, said dietary guidelines requiring lower-fat milk varieties in schools were antiquated. He’s also encouraged “full fat/whole milk” to be offered in Head Start programs for the nation’s youngest children.
 
‘Most delicious’
The milk legislation endorsed by Marshall, which has earned bipartisan support, is pending in the House and Senate.
Marshall said current federal standards undermined opportunities for children to take part in a “whole-foods” movement by consuming healthy fat necessary to absorbing vitamins A, D, E and K. The senator said whole milk contained omega-three fatty acids, which supported brain health and inflammation control.
He said the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act should be viewed as a plank of the “Make American Healthy Again movement.” It would echo President Donald Trump’s strategy of marketing reform under the Make America Great Again brand.
In the past, Marshall described milk as the “most delicious, most nutritious wholesome drink known to humankind.” He recalled milk from his grandfather’s Holstein dairy herd was delivered to his home when growing up in Kansas.
“I don’t know that I’m aware of any good studies either proving my point, but certainly it seems to me that whole milk tastes a whole lot better,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Marshall-loves-milk-2-1024x521.png,,,2025-04-02 17:06:34.589454

The National Weather Service predicted heavy rains and flooding for northeast Arkansas and upgraded the risk of tornadoes for a large swath of the state to a five out of five, the highest amount of risk, earlier on Wednesday.
Sanders said in a news release Wednesday afternoon that $250,000 had been released from the Governor’s Disaster Response and Recovery Fund.

The release said that “severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding are expected to occur in Arkansas, and continue thereafter, which may cause danger, hardship, and suffering throughout the state, which in turn, warrants this executive action.”
The National Weather Service has warned about “generational” flooding with potentially devastating effects in the northeast region of the state, which has been hit hard by severe weather in recent weeks. Ten to 15 inches of rain are expected in some areas over the next few days. 
“Generational Flooding Possible This isn’t routine,” the weather service in Memphis, which is responsible for parts of extreme northeast Arkansas, wrote on its X account Wednesday. “This is a rare, high-impact, and potentially devastating event. Heavy rainfall will likely lead to widespread river, flash, and areal flooding that could cause severe disruptions especially along and north of I-40.”
As of early Wednesday morning, a forecast graphic released by the Little Rock office of the National Weather Service on X said that the most extreme northeast areas of the state could get between 10 and 15 inches of rainfall by Sunday. Jonesboro, Searcy and Mountain View could receive between eight and ten inches. Little Rock, Pine Bluff and Hot Springs could receive between six and eight.

Amid increasing need, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has cancelled about $4.3 million in food orders to Michigan, equating to more than 2 million meals, according to the Food Bank Council of Michigan, or FBCM.
The network of seven food banks that are members of FBCM serve communities around Michigan and are working to make up for the cancelled meals, but the sudden and unexplained cancellation by the USDA hasn’t placed the council in a good position to address food insecurity in Michigan, Executive Director of FBCM Phillip Knight told Michigan Advance.

The food banks and organizations they partner with statewide had planned around the scheduled food deliveries throughout April to August, Knight said. The orders included chicken, pork, turkey, cheese and eggs as a part of the USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance Program which is in-part funded by the federal Commodity Credit Corporation, or CCC.
The Secretary of Agriculture has full discretion over how funds are allocated, Knight concedes, but the lack of communication with food banks explaining why the cancellations happened and what the future of food supplies orders will look like doesn’t serve as a solid foundation to address future hunger across states.
Food banks and food bankers will come up with creative solutions to work around not having the expected meat, eggs and cheese, but the foods may be less substantive replacements, Knight lamented and that isn’t a trade off food banks like to make for the sake of addressing hunger in households.
“We want to do the best we can for families, not the least. We want to do the best, because we in this culture in America, we use food to communicate value,” Knight said. “When somebody’s coming to visit you, you think, ‘what can I make for them that I make really good’… because you care about them… because you love them. We use food to communicate that.”
Now the council is concerned that without a formal explanation of why the shipments were cancelled and if Michigan can plan on any future shipments, it’s unclear how food banks will overcome the strain of scrambling to find other resources and meet growing demands in communities of need. Furthermore, Knight reasoned that the farmers and food producers who would have been paid through the Emergency Food Assistance Program will likely suffer as the program also serves to stabilize food markets so any overproduction can still generate profits for producers and benefit food pantries.
As food banks in other states face similar halts on expected orders, the USDA is reporting that they are reorganizing programs to promote sustainability with more reasonable expectations. In March, Nevada received notice that federal funding for programs serving the state’s two major food banks would be cut, with the USDA decrying the usage of the Commodity Credit Corporation federal funds, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
“Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in CCC (Commodity Credit Corporation) funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact. The COVID era is over—USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” a USDA spokesperson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
With new administrations come new rules, Knight said, and the food banks are good about tapping other community resources to accommodate when food shipments don’t work out. He added that it’s not uncommon for shipments from the USDA to be cancelled as sometimes the weather, a bad harvest or other factors impact produce, but when Michigan was expecting 123 semi trucks full of protein-filled substantive food like chicken and pork, it’s hard for the food banks to replace that sudden loss.
So now FBCM is going to rely on other resources within USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance Program that the department has made available, Knight said, but that food isn’t expected to make it to Michigan for six months.

“Why didn’t we do this more thoughtful so that it doesn’t injure the farmers, it doesn’t injure the food banks, and it doesn’t injure the families that we serve and then create a six month food gap that food banks are going to have to try to fill?” Knight said.
In the Trump administration’s pursuit of trimming down government spending and improving efficiency of federal dollars, the USDA has also cut more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs purchase food from local distributors with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins calling the programs “nonessential.”
When a person is hungry or having to daily think about where their next meal will come from, they only have one problem,  Knight said. The “toxic stress” of being food insecure and having to worry about feeding your family keeps generations of Michiganders from being able to tackle how to improve their lives, access education, get a better job and make moves to get to a better place. Offering the help of food to a household creates rippling effects in a community, Knight added.
“Let’s stop thinking about people who are struggling with hunger as  a problem to be solved,” Knight said. “Instead, let’s start thinking of them as people who are worthy of an investment.”

Chellie Pingree outside the U.S. Capitol. (Rep. Chellie Pingree via Facebook) Thousands of Mainers rely on the federal heating assistance program whose entire staff the Trump administration fired on Tuesday, leaving its future uncertain. 
The Low Income Heating Assistance Program is federally funded and provides financial assistance to lower income households to reduce the cost of energy bills. 
While the program remains in effect, its roughly 20 federal staffers were among the approximately 10,000 Department of Health and Human Services workers terminated this week as part of a mass layoff to make the agency “more responsive and efficient.” 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden responded to the firings on social media, writing in a post on X, “What ‘efficiency’ is achieved by firing everyone in Maine whose job is to help Mainers afford heating oil when it’s cold?”
For fiscal year 2025, Maine was awarded about $37.6 million in LIHEAP funding, as well as about $1.4 million for the Wabanaki Nations, according to a press release from Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins last fall. 
Most of that funding has already been received, however, the last 10% is funded through the continuing budget resolution Congress passed in March. 
In a social media post condemning the firings, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree asked, “How will LIHEAP distribute these funds (which have ALREADY been allocated by Congress) without staff? Make it make sense.” 
Without the assistance, families will have to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table, Pingree wrote. “It’s not only callous and cruel, it defies logic,” she added. 
Lucy Hochschartner, the climate and clean energy director for Maine Conservation Voters, said long-term the state should continue to invest in clean energy and double down on efficiency measures to decrease energy costs for Mainers but that LIHEAP is what Mainers need right now.
“I can bet that the people who decided to cut the entire LIHEAP staff have never struggled to pay their heating bill,” Hochschartner said. “In Maine, it doesn’t matter who you voted for — we know that everyone deserves to stay warm during our long winters, and this is the program that makes that possible.”  
Federal cuts aside, the program in Maine is already strained. 
During a meeting of the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee on Friday, Daniel Brennan, director of Maine State Housing Authority, told lawmakers that the state has seen an increase in applications for LIHEAP over the last five years — from 45,000 in 2019 to 70,000 in the past year — with no corresponding increase to its federal grant that provides the administrative dollars to hire enough staff to meet demand. The grant has remained at about $40 million. 
“This year has been a particularly difficult year because this year is the first year where we’ve had to face this head on, where we simply don’t have the money that the [community action programs] need to meet the higher demand of the applications,” Brennan said. 
The program puts out $675,000 on average per week, providing between 1,200 and 1,300 households with fuel assistance, he said, but a backlog of applicants remain.  
“The system is maxed out,” Brennan said.

That includes mass layoffs that hit core units and an executive order from Trump calling on the secretary to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the department to the maximum extent she legally can.Only Congress, which established the 45-year-old department, has the power to abolish it.The Democrats said they were grateful that McMahon met with them but dissatisfied with and even alarmed by the secretary’s responses, especially on a timeline for closing the agency.“It’s very apparent that the secretary is treating this as a corporate restructuring, and we want to be clear that the education of our children is not a corporate enterprise — it is how we move this country forward,” Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico said.“It’s very clear that the (reduction in force), the firing of probationary staff, the so-called restructuring that’s happening — when we asked for a plan multiple times in this meeting, we were told there is not a plan yet,” she added.The secretary arrives, and leavesAs the Democrats spoke, McMahon emerged from the building, accompanied by aides, and joined them at their lectern emblazoned with a U.S. House of Representatives logo.She reiterated that “funding from the United States government will continue through the programs that have already been established” and said she looked forward to continuing to work with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. After her remarks, Rep. Mark Takano pressed McMahon on when she would close the department.“Well, we’ve had our discussions already, so thank you all very, very much for coming,” McMahon replied, proceeding to walk back into the building.“You see, she’s not answering the question when she’s going to shut down the department,” Takano, of California, said as the secretary walked away.Barred from buildingWednesday’s meeting came after Takano and other Democratic lawmakers were blocked from entering the building in February while trying to meet with Denise Carter, acting Education secretary at the time, over Trump’s plans to dismantle the agency.The California Democrat had led dozens of others in writing a letter to Carter and requesting a meeting over those efforts.A day after Trump signed the executive order surrounding the department, he announced that special education services would be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services and that the Small Business Administration would be handling the student loan portfolio.The department has not taken any steps to move either — both of which would require acts of Congress and raise a slew of logistical questions.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said “the idea of dismembering the department and then parceling it out to other agencies and departments does not give us a lot of confidence or hope in what’s happening.”The lawmakers said McMahon repeatedly stressed during the meeting that she plans to abide by federal law and would look carefully at what she’s legally allowed to do before moving any functions of the department.Yet Rep. Greg Casar of Texas said he and the group “became more and more alarmed as the meeting went on,” noting that “current law won by so many Americans in this democracy, is that all kids deserve a decent education, that the money goes to your kid if they’re in need, the money goes to your kid no matter their race or their background or their neighborhood, and they want to change that.”The lawmakers who met with McMahon included: U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell of Alabama; Takano; Frederica Wilson of Florida; Raskin and Sarah Elfreth of Maryland; Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire; Stansbury; Casar, Julie Johnson and Veronica Escobar of Texas; Don Beyer of Virginia; and Gwen Moore of Wisconsin.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

Senate Bill 558, led by a trio of Republicans [&#8230;]","The campus of UNC-Chapel Hill (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)Republican lawmakers in North Carolina are looking to define a range of “discriminatory practices” and “divisive concepts” on college campuses through a new bill, the latest in of a series of efforts by GOP leadership to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion from all sectors of government.
Senate Bill 558, led by a trio of Republicans including the Senate leader, would seek to expand on a ban on DEI practices already put in place by the UNC System Board of Governors.
While the bill is entitled “Eliminating ‘DEI’ in Public Higher Education,” sponsor Sen. Brad Overcash (R-Gaston) argued that the measure does not bar diversity, equity and inclusion nor seek to define it.

Rather, it defines a range of “divisive concepts” and “discriminatory practices” that campuses are forbidden from endorsing or affirming — including treating a person differently “solely to advantage or disadvantage that individual.” The language is almost identical to a similar bill applying to K-12 public schools, which has passed the Senate.
Those practices and programming have “divided our campus, divided our student bodies, divided our faculties, along lines that are unnecessary and unproductive,” said Overcash.
But critics of the bill warned Wednesday that as written, it could have wide-reaching impacts on scholarship programs for minority and rural students, as well as potentially chilling classroom discussions about race and other subjects.
“The problem is, they’re defined in vague and sweeping terms,” Sen. Caleb Theodros (D-Mecklenburg) said during a Senate Education Committee hearing. “It’s not really based on the intent, it’s interpretation.”
Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) raised questions (see the video above) about wording in the bill that purports to ban “DEI” initiatives without ever defining what the term refers to.
And Reighlah Collins, policy counsel for the ACLU of North Carolina, said the bill would hurt recruitment efforts and “result in censorship of curricula.”
Republican sponsors pushed back on those lines of criticism. Overcash said he believed scholarship programs were “apples and oranges” compared to the practices and ideas in the crosshairs of the bill.
But the chair of the committee, Sen. Michael Lee (R-Hanover), urged members to get in touch if they were concerned about specific items in the list of “divisive concepts.”

“Please come and talk to us so we make sure we understand the impact of that in this particular bill,” Lee said.
The bill would require both the State Board of Community Colleges and the UNC System Board of Governors to adopt new DEI policies to comply with the new regulations.
In May 2024, the UNC System board voted to repeal its DEI policy, replacing it with a statement of “principled neutrality.” Months later, the university had eliminated at least 59 positions in response.
And shortly after the Trump administration took office this year and purported to ban DEI through executive order, the university stopped requiring DEI general education courses, the Raleigh News & Observer reported.
Other states have pushed for similar restrictions on both K-12 schools and higher education. Last year, Alabama passed a sweeping anti-DEI law for public schools that included a ban on affirming or endorsing “divisive concepts”; two years prior, Georgia passed a similar law. And other bills with similar language have been introduced by Republican lawmakers in Missouri and Kansas, according to a tracker by Education Week.

(Courtesy images from Gov. Dan McKee's office)The previous head of the Rhode Island National Guard is Gov. Dan McKee’s latest pick to join the state’s Ethics Commission, replacing a member the governor placed on the state parole board.
Retired Maj. Gen. Christopher P. Callahan will join the nine-member volunteer panel responsible for enforcing and administering the state’s code of ethics.
Callahan retired from the military in February after decades of service — the last 10 years as the 44th adjutant general and commander of the state’s National Guard. Callahan previously served as commander of the 56th Troop Command at Camp Fogarty in East Greenwich, where he led, trained and supported 900 soldiers and six different military units. 
He also served as the director of aviation and safety at the Quonset Point Air National Guard Base in North Kingstown from 2006 to 2011 and was a battalion commander in Balad, Iraq.
In his announcement Wednesday, McKee touted Callahan’s experience and the value it would bring to the commission which has the power to fine and remove elected officials from office.
“Throughout his more than four decades of military service, General Callahan has built a proven record of fairness, integrity, and ethical leadership,” the governor said in a statement. “He will be a valuable addition to the commission, and I have full confidence that he will help uphold the highest standards of integrity in public service.” 
Callahan thanked the governor for his trust and confidence.
“I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Ethics Commission to ensure transparency and integrity throughout our state,” Callahan said in a statement. 
Advice and consent from the Rhode Island Senate is not required for the position, as no such wording was included in the 1986 constitutional amendment that created the commission. Terms on the commission are five years.
Callahan will replace Dr. Jill Hume Harrison, a sociologist at Rhode Island College who McKee appointed to the seven-member Rhode Island Parole Board. Harrison had been appointed to the Ethics Commission by McKee in August.
Harrison will take the spot of Tonya Glantz, who the governor appointed to the Parole Board in January 2024.
Harrison previously served as a consultant and researcher with the Culture of Wellness for the Maine State Prison. She also has previous experience in Rhode Island, providing seven years of meditation and cognitive behavior training to people incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions in Cranston. She continues to offer onsite diversity, equity and inclusion training to cadets.
She holds a bachelor’s degree from Wells College in New York and a master’s degree from George Mason University in Virginia. She earned her PhD in sociology at the University of New Hampshire.
“I am honored to accept the governor’s appointment to serve on the state’s probation and parole board,” Harrison said in a statement. “This role presents a significant opportunity to contribute to the fair and effective administration of justice in our community.”
Senate approval is not required for appointments to the Parole Board, whose members serve three year terms and can be reappointed.

The companies — ExxonMobil-affiliate Saltwerx LLC and SWA Lithium, which is a joint venture between Standard Lithium and Norwegian energy giant [&#8230;]","Standard Lithium signage at offices on East Elm Street in downtown El Dorado. 
(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate 02/28/2023)Two companies have filed applications for new brine units in South Arkansas for potential lithium extraction projects, a necessary procedural move under state law that a previous royalty application ran afoul of last year.
The companies — ExxonMobil-affiliate Saltwerx LLC and SWA Lithium, which is a joint venture between Standard Lithium and Norwegian energy giant Equinor — are asking the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission to unitize thousands of acres in South Arkansas. 
Both companies aim to extract lithium from subterranean brines through a process called direct lithium extraction, or DLE. It’s part of a broader push nationally to obtain domestic supplies of lithium and other materials necessary for electronics of all kinds, from smartphones to electric vehicles.
But before extraction can begin, prospective lithium producers must first satisfy a key procedural requirement outlined in Arkansas law — establishing a lithium extraction royalty. Royalties are paid to property owners who agree to lease their mineral rights to the extraction companies. For the companies to establish a royalty they need to establish brine units. The unit and the royalty are necessary because of the language of the Arkansas Brine Conservation Act (ABCA) of 1979, and the Oil and Gas Commission has to approve the units and the royalties.
A brine unit is an area designated by the commission for the extraction and injection of underground brines, such as those found in the Smackover formation. 
The part of the act specifically pertaining to royalties for substances like lithium requires producers to account for the amounts extracted from each landowner’s property in the unit and establish a “fair and equitable” royalty. 
“We are excited to move our SWA Project forward with our application to form the Reynolds unit in Lafayette and Columbia counties,” wrote Jesse Edmondson, Standard Lithium’s director of government relations, in a text message. 
“Establishing a unit is a necessary step to commercially produce lithium from brine in Arkansas. After the unit is established, we will file an application to set a royalty for this unit,” Edmondson said. “The SWA Project is our primary focus in Arkansas, and we look forward to completing this process to allow a final investment decision by year end.”
Both companies previously emphasized the importance of the royalty in their decision-making; it is one of the last remaining unknown variables that the companies will have to factor in as they consider the economics of potential projects and decide whether to move forward on them.
“Establishing our brine unit is a key regulatory step to unlock the lithium industry in Lafayette and Miller counties, enabling jobs and investment potential for Arkansas,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement.
Both companies already tried for a royalty — Saltwerx once, Standard Lithium twice — but concerns with the applications and lack of information provided to commissioners resulted in them being rejected or withdrawn.
Last year, a joint royalty application filed by Saltwerx and Standard Lithium, alongside Lanxess, Albemarle and Tetra, asked the commission to determine a royalty for an area it described as “the Smackover Limestone Formation underlying lands within Columbia, Lafayette, Miller and Union Counties.” However, the Smackover formation is a geologic feature; not mentioned in the July 2024 application were the brine units such a royalty would apply to.
Objections filed by the South Arkansas Minerals Association argued that the Brine Conservation Act required royalties to be determined on a “unit-by-unit basis.” The association is a nonprofit composed of large southern Arkansas landowners, many of whom hold mineral rights. 
The association’s objections both on the issue of brine units and other aspects of the application ultimately led to a hearing presided over by an administrative law judge, who recommended how commissioners should interpret the law. 
The judge, Charles Moulton, agreed with the association on the matter of whether a royalty needed to be determined on a unit-by-unit basis, pointing out that the ABCA repeatedly references units in its language.
Moulton said during the hearing that he was concerned that granting a royalty without basing it on a unit could have unintended consequences.
“The concern that I have when I read the statute and when I read the application is, is the Commission unwittingly opening up Pandora’s box by establishing a royalty on a formation when they’ve never done that before? They’ve always done it on units,” Moulton said in October.
Tom Daily, the attorney representing the applicants, told Moulton the application couldn’t be based on units because some of the joint applicants did not yet have the units those companies planned to extract brine from. He said expecting the companies to form units before they had decided whether they would move ahead with lithium extraction projects was expensive.
“If we’re told we can’t even talk to you (the commission) until you have formed your units … and the result is unfavorable, that’s a lot more money wasted,” Daily said.
“I cannot amend this application to apply to units that don’t exist yet,” Daily continued. “They will exist.”
Moulton agreed, but added that the applicants could “certainly” amend it to units that did exist. He recommended that the applicants amend their proposal to specify the units they wanted the royalty to apply to.
The applicants then amended their application days before a two-day commission hearing on the lithium royalty in November, changing the language to apply to Smackover brine from existing units, along with “proposed future units.”
At that hearing, the commission ultimately adopted Moulton’s written recommendation that “the establishment of a brine unit is a condition precedent in establishing a lithium royalty under the Brine Act.” At the time, Saltwerx and Standard Lithium didn’t yet have their own established brine units. 
The Oil and Gas Commission unanimously rejected the joint application, citing a variety of concerns mostly separate from the unit establishment issue. 
By obtaining a brine unit prior to filing for the royalty again — which both companies have stated they intend to do in statements and AOGC filings — the companies would resolve one of the conflicts of law that arose during last year’s proceedings.
The areas encompassed by each company’s proposed unit are vast. SWA Lithium’s proposed Reynolds Unit is approximately 20,854 acres; Saltwerx’s proposed Pine Unit is approximately 56,245 acres.
In order to ask the commission to form a unit, applicants are required to already have 75% of the mineral rights in that area under a lease agreement. If a unit is approved by the commission, the remaining 25% would be “integrated” into the unit. According to documents filed with the commission, SWA Lithium currently has 79% of the area under lease, with that number increasing to 88% if a potential brine lease transfer agreement with Saltwerx and Tetra goes through.
Saltwerx did not provide a specific percentage of leases in the area of its proposed unit, only stating that it had “in excess” of 75%. 
The applications for brine unit integration will likely be heard by the commission during its April 22 meeting in El Dorado. If they are approved, royalty applications are likely to follow.
State officials have been intent on establishing a lithium industry in Arkansas, promoting the potential economic benefits the investment will generate. A bill was also filed in the Legislature last week that would grant extraction projects a variety of tax incentives until the 2030s.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EL-DORADO-CHEMICAL-JCS10101-1024x662.jpg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

A section of the federal Medicaid Act says patients “may obtain” care from any provider who is willing and qualified.
It will be up to the nation’s highest court to decide what that means.
Attorneys for South Carolina and the U.S. government contend that allows states to choose which providers can be reimbursed for Medicaid-covered health care services. An attorney for Planned Parenthood argued those words give patients the right to see the provider of their choice.
The case stems from a 2018 executive order in which Gov. Henry McMaster directed the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from the list of providers that patients can choose to visit for non-abortion health care services.

Under federal law, Medicaid can’t pay for abortions.
But Planned Parenthood also offers “family planning” services Medicaid does cover, such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Because the Medicaid Act doesn’t explicitly use the word “right,” or similar words, such as “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” the state isn’t legally obligated to allow patients to see whatever health care provider they want, argued John Bursch, an attorney representing the state, and Kyle Hawkins, an attorney for the Office of the Solicitor General.
“We’re looking for unmistakable rights-creating language,” said Hawkins, who presented the federal government’s arguments in support of the state.
Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Kentaji Brown Jackson seemed to differ.
Requiring certain phrasing would be like telling Congress there are “magic words” that can make the court interpret the law a certain way, said the justices who are generally considered liberal.
Justice Elana Kagan was more direct in her questioning. The law’s phrasing seems to clearly convey that a patient has the right to choose their provider, she said.

“It’s impossible to even say the thing without using the word ‘right,’” Kagan said.
The use of the word “may” is not related to a person’s choice in what provider they visit but rather whether they choose to seek out health care at all, Kagan said.
“The ‘may’ is just, ‘You may see a doctor,’” Kagan said. “We’re not forcing people to see doctors.”
If the court interpreted the law as allowing states to deny Medicaid reimbursements to any doctor or practice state politicians deem unqualified, that could lead to any number of arbitrary decisions about who to include or exclude from the provider list, she said.
Some states might decide to approve only the providers that perform abortions, offer contraception or do gender transition treatment, while other states might decide the opposite, she said.
“Every state could split up the world by providers like that, right?” Kagan said.
Allowing states to do that, she added, would give patients “no ability to come back and say, ‘That’s wrong, I’m entitled to see my provider of choice, regardless of what they think about contraception or abortion or gender transition treatment.’”
Congress passed that part of the Medicaid Act because some states were trying to “steer their Medicaid beneficiaries to certain providers and away from others,” Jackson said.
That suggests Congress intended people to be able to choose which providers they want to see, said Nicole Saharsky, attorney for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
“There aren’t that many things that are more important than being able to choose your doctor, the person that you see when you’re at your most vulnerable, facing some of the most significant challenges to your life and your health,” Saharsky said. “Congress said a long time ago, ‘This is something we want to protect.’”
In response, Bursch argued that interpreting the wording as giving patients the right to choose their provider could open up a flood of lawsuits from people whose preferred doctors aren’t on the list.
SC’s Planned Parenthood Medicaid funding case before the Supreme Court 7 years after McMaster’s order

The law already creates an appeals process for patients who feel their care isn’t sufficient, Bursch said. Providers can also appeal to the courts if they feel they were unfairly excluded, he said.
He likened the process to private insurance, in which an insurance company will only cover care provided by doctors considered part of its network.
“The beneficiary doesn’t have the right to whip out a magic wand and then just hit on the head the doctor that they want, and then they must be qualified under Medicaid,” Bursch said.
But that process doesn’t allow a person to appeal until they’ve seen the provider, meaning that person couldn’t challenge the decision to remove a health care provider from the list entirely, said Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
“That’s the beneficiary taking the risk, going to the provider she wants to see and then potentially having to pay out of pocket,” Barrett said.
Outside the Supreme Court
Activists on both sides gathered outside the U.S. Supreme Court during the hearing, with competing bright pink signs that read “defund” or “fund” Planned Parenthood.
But representatives for Planned Parenthood said justices’ ruling is not about the organization’s ability to operate, but whether patients will lose access to health care.
“If we lose, it won’t shut us down,” said Molly Rivera, communications director for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. “The real impact is going to be on the patients. It’s going to be on people who rely on Medicaid and Title X for preventative health care.”
Other activists who traveled to the nation’s capital showed their support with homemade signs.
They included Alex Brunken; her husband, John McNeil; and their son, Glen, who came from Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, to support Planned Parenthood.
“Poor people should also get to choose who their providers are, not just wealthy people,” said Brunken, who described her work as being in “reproductive health care,” adding she wanted her son to see the work she and her co-workers do. 
This week, the Trump administration also temporarily froze nearly $30 million in Title X family-planning grants to Planned Parenthood affiliates, which the Guttmacher Institute estimates could impact more than 1 million people seeking contraception, testing for sexually transmitted infections or other reproductive health services.
The Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing South Carolina officials in the lawsuit, argues that any money going to Planned Parenthood ultimately goes toward funding abortion.
“We know that money is fungible, so any dollar that’s going to an abortion facility like Planned Parenthood — even earmarked for other services — is going to enable more dollars that they have to then go towards things like their abortion activism or performing more abortions,” said Gabriella McIntyre, legal counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom.
“States need to be free to fund real, comprehensive, high-quality health care in their states and exclude organizations like Planned Parenthood” from their limited funding, she said.

McIntyre said South Carolina has “nearly 200 high quality, comprehensive healthcare facilities that are publicly funded” where Medicaid patients could go instead of Planned Parenthood for family planning services.
Rivera and other reproductive rights advocates in the state have argued there is a dearth of reproductive health providers who accept Medicaid and who are accepting new patients.
Rivera said Planned Parenthood, which is a nonprofit, actually loses money as a Medicaid provider because the government’s reimbursement rates are lower than the cost of the approved services they provide, such as cervical cancer screenings and birth control.
That’s why many for-profit health providers do not accept or limit the amount of Medicaid patients they see, which Planned Parenthood does not, she said.
She said she worries residents of South Carolina, where most abortions are currently banned after six weeks’ gestation, might have to start traveling out of state — not just for abortions, but for birth control and Pap smears.
“Both of our health centers, Columbia and Charleston, are also part of Title X, so we see people for Title X and Medicaid, and if you can’t do either because of the government, I don’t know where people are going to go,” Rivera said. “Especially with cancer screenings, early detection saves lives. So, if you have to travel across state lines for your Pap smear, are you going to be able to do that? People will just forgo care.”
While reproductive rights advocates outside the court rallied in favor of patients’ rights, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina’s Fifth District argued states should have the right to determine their Medicaid providers.
He called it a case about choice as laid out in the 10th amendment of the U.S. Constitution as giving powers to the states.
It’s about the state’s choice “to determine where limited resources go, the choice of South Carolinians to align our Medicaid policies with our values, and the choice of our nation to uphold the principles of federalism that our founders so wisely enshrined,” Norman, a Rock Hill Republican who might run for governor, said while addressing national anti-abortion leaders. “I urge the court behind us to affirm our right to make these decisions free from outside interference, and I will continue to fight just alongside each one of you until this right is protected.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SCOTUS_Sofia-Resnick-Planned-Parenthood-supporters.jpg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

House Bill 119, brought by House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, would have created a program to market Montana beef, called a checkoff. The United States Department of Agriculture’s “Got Milk” campaign is perhaps the most famous example of a “checkoff” program.
The bill sought to create a “favorable environment” for cattle producers in Montana to market their product both domestically and internationally. 
Part of the debate was an additional tax on beef cattle, which opponents said would add up for producers, who didn’t want to be paying to help market their competitors’ products.
Proponents of the bill have said the program would have benefited cattle producers across the state.
There was a small amendment to the bill that would have required the governor to appoint members of the Cattle Committee.
One member of the Senate Agriculture committee, Sen. Dennis Lenz, R-Billings, said he was a supporter of the bill until the Senate hearing. He voted no both on the amendment and the bill itself.
“Ag leaders that I know (and) have worked with, were opposed to this,” Lenz said in the hearing. “I feel like this bill needs a lot of work.”

(Photo via Google Earth)While legislation allowing all Iowa nursing home residents to have cameras in their rooms has failed to advance this session, the technology is being successfully used in one Iowa care facility.
State records show that unlike many Iowa nursing homes, Des Moines’ Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation has a policy of allowing the use of resident-installed cameras so that family members can remotely monitor their loved ones.
The son of one elderly male resident of the home took advantage of that policy and had a camera installed in his father’s room at Greater Southside. Footage captured on Jan. 17, 2025, allegedly shows a certified nurse aide entering the man’s room at about 2 a.m., as the resident slept, and then accessing a locked drawer where the resident kept his money. It was later reported that $55 was missing from the drawer. Based on the video, the worker was fired.
The nurse aide was later interviewed by state inspectors and reportedly admitted entering the resident’s room but denied taking any money. She reportedly told inspectors that she was not aware the resident’s room was monitored by a camera installed by the man’s son.
The home’s administrator, Dirk Timm, told inspectors he watched the video on the son’s phone and it was evident to him that the nurse aide had unlocked the resident’s dresser drawer with a key, picked up something and placed the item in her pocket. He told inspectors the nurse aide informed him the resident had asked her to put his wallet in the drawer — a claim the resident denied.
The facility was subsequently fined $500 for failing to protect residents from abuse in the form of financial exploitation.
Timm told the Iowa Capital Dispatch the facility allows resident-installed cameras as long as they don’t intrude on the privacy of other residents and don’t capture bedside care in a manner that could violate a resident’s right to dignity. If a resident who wants an in-room camera has a roommate, the roommate and the facility must each agree to the use of such a device.
So far, Timm said, the policy of allowing cameras hasn’t caused any problems.
“There has been some suspicion of the cameras among some people, but I think that may be just paranoia,” he said. “But we do have information posted, as far as our policies go, and so if anyone does have an issue with the policy we just try to contact the resident’s family and let them know.”
After nine years, legislation remains stalled 
A week after the incident at Greater Southside, legislation that would prohibit Iowa care facilities from barring the use of resident-installed cameras was introduced in the Iowa House and referred to a committee. Although it is backed by the state’s Office of Long-Term Care Ombudsman, it has failed to advance.
Similar legislation was introduced in the Iowa Senate last month, but it, too, has failed to advance.
Since 2017, similar legislation has repeatedly run into stiff opposition from the Iowa Health Care Association, the organization that lobbies the Iowa Legislature on behalf of many of the state’s nursing homes.
During the 2023 legislative session, IHCA lobbyist Merea Bentrott told Iowa’s nursing home owners she was “locked, loaded and ready to go” in opposing that year’s cameras-in-nursing-homes bill.
“This is something we’ve opposed for many, many years,” Bentrott told IHCA members on a call the association recorded and later uploaded to its website. She said she was able to persuade a committee chairman to spike the bill and prevent it from moving forward.
“I’m happy to say that yesterday we were able to kill that legislation,” Bentrott said in the call. “That is good news. That was on the House side of things. The bill never had legs in the Senate. We talked to them very early on and we were able to get them to a point where they agreed that camera legislation was not something that they would make an issue this year. So, we were confident we would be able to kill the bill in the Senate, but we didn’t even want it to get to a subcommittee in the House and we were successful in preventing that from happening. So that is a big win.”
During a subsequent call, Bentrott warned the IHCA members that the camera legislation was likely to come up again in the future. “This is something that will probably come up every single year,” she said. “Best case scenario is that we kill it before it even gets any legs.”
This year, the Iowa Health Care Association is not officially registered as lobbying lawmakers on either the House or Senate version of the camera-in-nursing-homes bill.
However, IHCA was never registered as opposing the 2023 bill, either — despite Bentrott’s admission that she had actively and successfully lobbied lawmakers in an effort to “kill” the legislation.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Greater.jpg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

(Getty Images)A bill to authorize body cameras for law enforcement officers across state agencies has advanced in the state Senate.
Senate Bill 520, sponsored by state Sen. Lisa Baker (R-Luzerne), would authorize deputy law enforcement officers with the Pennsylvania Game Commission, Fish & Boat Commission, and Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Rangers and State Park Officers to wear body cameras. The measure was approved by a 13-1 vote in the chamber’s Judiciary Committee.
Baker described body worn cameras as an “invaluable tool for modern law enforcement” in the co-sponsorship memo of the legislation, adding “they provide an accurate and unbiased account of officer engagement, protecting the integrity of citizens and officers alike.”
“In this case, the importance is amplified as law enforcement from these agencies work independently and in remote areas, oftentimes in locations that have poor radio and cellphone coverage, and frequently encounter individuals who are themselves armed,” Baker wrote. “Additionally, the nature of law enforcement within these agencies is evolving as officers are increasingly confronting serious drug activity and other criminal cases outside of the scope of sporting safety, wildlife protection, and outdoor recreation.”

Baker notes if passed, the bill would not impose a mandate, but instead allow each agency to decide on a “timeline of its choosing.”
Act 202, passed over a decade ago, granted authority for trained officers of PFBC and PGC to wear body cameras. It resulted in Waterways Conservative Officers of the Fish & Boat Commission and certain Officers and State Game Wardens to receive training and wear these devices, according to the co-sponsorship memo. But, deputies of the agencies were purposefully excluded under Act 202 and the prohibition remains in statute. 
During the previous session, the Senate Game & Fisheries Committee unanimously approved the proposal in October, but it did not pass the full chamber.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/body-camera-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho Legislature this week approved an additional portion of Idaho Medicaid’s budget, sending the bill to Gov. Brad Little for final consideration.
Senate Bill 1201 would allocate nearly $674.2 million for Idaho Medicaid. Most of the funds — about $515.1 million — will come from the federal government, with the state’s general fund contributing $70.1 million.
The budget bill would fund a mix of largely administrative programs, including some that are required by the federal government or court order, along with a complex hospital tax structure.
The Idaho House passed the bill on a 40-30 vote Wednesday, two days after the Senate passed the bill on a 22-13 vote. 
Idaho Medicaid is the state’s largest government program that offers health insurance assistance to roughly 262,000 Idahoans. 
All told, Idaho’s total Medicaid budget for next fiscal year could be almost $5.25 billion, an 11.5% growth from this fiscal year. 
Most of next year’s budget — $3.4 billion — is set to come from the federal government, which funds most regular Medicaid costs for Idaho and 90% of Medicaid expansion’s costs. The state’s general fund would contribute a little less than $1 billion to Idaho Medicaid’s total budget next year. 
The 2026 fiscal year starts in July. 
The bill also cuts $15.9 million in Medicaid expenses, anticipating that amount in savings from House Bill 345, a sweeping Medicaid policy reform bill Little signed that calls for work requirements, privatized Medicaid benefit management and more.

 House debate rehashed worry over growing Medicaid budget, and angst over ‘enhancement’ budgets

For the past two years, Idaho’s powerful budget-setting committee has used a new practice of splitting state agencies budget bills in two categories.
So-called maintenance budgets just include enough funds for essential services. New spending is included in so-called enhancement budgets, like Senate Bill 1201.
Idaho’s budget committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, crafted the budget bill March 21.

But “these are not new programs” they are “ongoing enhancements,” bill cosponsor Rep. Rod Furniss, R-Rigby, told House lawmakers in debate Wednesday.
“Many items on this budget … are expenses we’ve incurred. And we have an invoice for, that we need to pay,” Furniss told House lawmakers. “These are hospital stays. These are people in homes. These are infants with brain tumors. The list goes on and on — of people that we’re helping in the state of Idaho that can’t help themselves.”
The House’s debate, which lasted over half an hour, rehashed Republican Idaho lawmakers yearslong concerns over Idaho Medicaid’s growing budget. It also was another example of a newer trend this year — of state lawmakers trying to (with some success) reject state agency enhancement budgets.
Calling next year’s Medicaid total budget the largest Idaho has ever had, Rep. Faye Thompson, R-McCall, said she couldn’t vote for a budget of this size.
“This comes at a very great cost to the working man. And it comes at a very great cost to generations that follow us, and that also includes everybody in this room,” she said.

(Alissa Eckert/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)TOPEKA — Five of the six southwest Kansas counties reporting measles cases have seen kindergarten vaccination rates drop, one showing a 24 percentage point dip over a four-year period.
Vaccination rates are one focus of many Kansas county health officers and medical experts as they work to educate against misinformation about vaccines in the hopes of staving off a growing measles outbreak. As of April 2, Kansas has 24 confirmed measles cases in Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton and Stevens counties, with one case added in the last week.
For herd immunity to be achieved — the point where enough people are vaccinated that those who are unvaccinated will be protected — 95% of a population must be vaccinated against measles, according to the World Health Organization. The Kansas measles immunization rate of kindergarteners dropped from 94.47% in 2019 to 90.21% in 2023, Kansas Department of Health and Environment data shows.
Jennifer Bacani McKenney, a family physician and county health officer in Wilson County, said she saw vaccine hesitancy increase after the COVID-19 pandemic.
“COVID made it more OK for people to decline vaccines for themselves and for children,” she said.
The idea, though, that some counties are seeing kindergarten vaccination rates drop — such as Gray County, where the rate declined from 85% in 2019 to 61% in 2023 — is concerning, Bacani McKenney said.



“When we’re getting to those points when barely the majority are vaccinated, that’s when these diseases have a chance to come back,” she said. “We know vaccines work. Polio is still probably the No. 1 example. For the longest time, so was measles, and now we’re at the point where we can’t use measles as an example.
“We are very voluntarily not protecting ourselves against a very preventable illness,” Bacani McKenney said. “The people who are suffering are really not us adults. It’s going to be our children.”
Haskell County also hit a double-digit drop in vaccination rates, with 21% fewer kindergarteners being vaccinated over that same four-year period.
Vaccinations are required for school in Kansas unless there is a religious or medical exemption. KDHE and the Kansas State Department of Education track the percentage of kindergarteners who have vaccine exemptions, and those rates are increasing too — in Haskell County from 11% in 2019 to over 25% in 2023 and in Gray County jumping from about 2% to 11%.
In Barton County, where kindergarten immunization rates dropped by nearly 7 percentage points from 2019 to 2023, Karen Winkelman, a registered nurse and director of the Barton County Health Department said she is receiving numerous questions from parents about vaccine safety. She said her team made the decision to be proactive once they heard that measles cases were reappearing nationwide.
Winkelman stresses having productive, positive conversations.
“We need to take a positive approach on this and hold down that hysteria,” she said. “We know this disease. We know the vaccine. We have something available for protection.”
It isn’t like the COVID-19 pandemic, she said, where the vaccine information changed frequently. They are disseminating information carefully, using only reliable sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, KDHE, the American Academy of Family Physicians and others.
“We are going with factual information. The more we can educate and provide the factual, the better it is,” Winkelman said. “We’re never going to be able to control on social media or in normal conversations what is being said. We just have to really focus on those organizations that are reliable and accurate.”
The Barton County Health Department is holding an immunization clinic from 10 a.m. to noon Saturday, outside of their regular business hours, to make sure staff is available to answer questions and offer vaccinations, Winkelman said.
“We’re not going to force anyone to get the vaccine,” she said. “I just want to have all of those things available to the public for them to make an educated decision. It might be a conversation with their primary care also.”
Stevens County, which was the first Kansas county to report a measles case on March 13, currently has had six measles cases. Cammie Heaton, administrator for the county’s health department, is taking the same approach as Barton County — educate and be available to answer questions.
“We’re actually, knock on wood, sitting better now than we were three weeks ago. We are hopeful that we aren’t going to have any more,” she said. “We’re still monitoring some susceptible individuals.”
Like Barton County, her staff have offered walk-in clinics for measles vaccinations or boosters. Stevens County, according to KDHE data, has seen its vaccination rate among kindergarteners drop by 14 percentage points, from 87% in 2019 to 73% in 2023.
All measles cases in Stevens County were in unvaccinated individuals, Heaton said.
Dana Hawkinson, an internal medicine and infectious disease physician, spoke about the measles outbreak at a recent University of Kansas Health System news briefing.
“I think people should be concerned, particularly if they’re in communities that have decreased vaccination rates,” he said. “Measles is probably the most infectious viral disease that we know of. It is spread through airborne means, so people will express it into the air when they cough or breathe. Measles can linger in the air in a room for two hours.”
Combatting misinformation about the disease is critical, Hawkinson said, pointing to social media algorithms that can play into the information people receive online. But there are other factors, as well.
“We know misinformation is significant but we can’t be myopic in thinking that is the only thing we need to understand,” he said. “There are other factors in play as well.”
Those include people seeking less medical care after the pandemic, states offering increased options for vaccine exemptions, significant mistrust of science and public health medicine, as well as mistrust of physicians, Hawkinson said.
“All of these things are playing a role now to increase the risk of an individual and a community against things like this which were otherwise vaccine preventable,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/21074-e1741997984627-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449
