(Sophie Nieto-Munoz | New Jersey Monitor) A state grand jury has declined to charge a Fort Lee police officer who killed a woman last year during what her family described as a mental health episode.
The grand jury’s decision comes nearly one full year after Officer Tony Pickens shot and killed Victoria Lee, 25, in her apartment. Lee’s killing renewed calls for local authorities to respond to some emergency calls with mental health specialists instead of police officers. 
“Why do we need armed officers at the doors of people who are trying to seek what’s essentially medical care, at all?” said Amber Reed, co-executive director of AAPI Montclair.
Reed said the grand jury’s decision not to charge Pickens illustrates a systematic lack of accountability for police violence that disproportionately harms communities of color.
“To see this family that did everything right and be treated at every step of this horrible tragedy in this way is not going to have a positive effect on our community’s willingness to seek help when they need it,” Reed said.
Authorities said Lee’s brother called 911 seeking help on July 28, 2024, and asked for “just an ambulance.” After being told police officers would arrive too, Lee tried to cancel the call, but the dispatcher told him police would have to respond because he reported that his sister was holding a knife, authorities said.
Police body camera footage from that day shows officers breaking down the door of Lee’s apartment, Lee appearing at the door holding a large water jug, officers yelling at her to drop the knife, and then one officer firing a single shot in her chest.
Last year, Lee’s family said she was not holding a knife when officers forced their way into the apartment.
Shortly after Lee’s killing, Attorney General Matthew Platkin issued a new directive that requires police to involve a supervisor when responding to barricaded individuals and mandates the presence of mental health professionals and less-lethal weaponry. The directive also encourages officers to wait instead of forcing their way in when responding to a barricaded person.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)An unusually lengthy saga to craft Providence’s 2026 fiscal plan concluded Tuesday morning with Mayor Brett Smiley signing what he called “the most difficult budget” since his tenure began in 2023.
“We passed a balanced budget, and we did so without making cuts to city services while still making real sacrifices, to demonstrate both our own belt tightening, and to make sure that the burden of this year’s budget was not put exclusively on our taxpayers,” Smiley told reporters at a Tuesday morning press event in his City Hall office immediately before he added his signature to the budget.
City councilors, city employees and a couple of state legislators joined Smiley on the morning after the Providence City Council approved the budget for the second time via a 12-2 vote at a special meeting. (The Providence City Council needs to vote on matters twice before they can be sent to the mayor for final approval.) There were two no votes on the budget’s second pass from Councilors Shelley Peterson and Oscar Vargas. Councilor Ana Vargas was absent.
Smiley’s initial draft of the 2026 spending plan arrived on April 16. The ensuing 12 weeks involved much back-and-forth as councilors and the mayor enlisted the help of the Rhode Island General Assembly to permit the city to increase its levy, or overall tax revenue, above the 4% state-mandated annual cap. Two of the lawmakers who co-sponsored the legislation to OK the tweaked levy cap — Sen. Sam Zurier and Rep. Scott Slater, both Providence Democrats — attended the press conference and stood quietly in the lineup alongside Smiley and City Council President Rachel Miller.
The final $624 million budget accommodates a 5.85% increase in the city’s levy, below the 8% allowed by the recent state legislation or the 7.5% Smiley proposed initially. While the budget technically lowers property tax rates, higher property values mean most people will still receive bigger tax bills. 
The budget was revised in late June to even out tax bill increases among different types of homeowners. The finalized budget includes an average residential property tax increase of 6%, although non-owner-occupied homes with two to five units will still see the highest increase. 
The budget for fiscal year 2026 arrives two weeks after the fiscal year began on July 1.  
“Effective today, you can come in to the city tax collector to pay your bill if you’re anxious to do so,” Smiley said, and added that bills will also be available online this week. Paper bills via mail are being printed this week and should start to arrive in mailboxes sometime next week, Smiley added.
Because the budget arrived late, taxpayers will have a grace period until Aug. 20 to make their first quarterly payment. First-quarter tax bills are usually due in late July.
The 2026 budget also doubles the veteran’s exemption and increases the elderly exemption by 25%. Smiley said people who have had tax exemptions in the past don’t need to reapply. First-time applicants who are eligible can visit the tax assessor’s office at City Hall.

A ‘monumental’ budget process
“It bears repeating that this was an exceptionally tough year,” said City Council President Rachel Miller, noting spiking home values, rising rents and the cost of living for the city’s working class families as challenges to tackle in this year’s budget process. 
“On top of it all, we were faced with the added difficulty of making up for decades of underfunding our schools in this one year,” Miller added. “So the task before us as we entered this process was monumental.”
That underfunding exerted the most weight upon the budget: A November 2024 settlement with the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) requires the city to pay $15 million, plus make additional investments in subsequent fiscal years, to cover deficits in the city’s school department, which has been under state control since 2019. 
For fiscal year 2026, the city needed to allot about $11 million toward the school settlement. To fill the sudden crater in the city budget, Smiley relied on the levy cap exemption and some deep slashes to individual municipal departments’ budgets. Smiley and city officials told reporters this was perhaps the first time so many departmental line items had been cut in one fell swoop. 
Smiley said many city departments will have to “make do with less, and you’re going to have offices being expected to produce the same amount of work with fewer employees, and so we know that that’s a sacrifice.” 
More than 20 positions — all of them vacant — were eliminated in this year’s budget, and Smiley said he does not expect the positions will return in the future. But the mayor emphasized the budget leaves core city services like trash, public safety and emergency services untouched. 
“I think it is the right and compassionate thing to do to look for opportunities to cut where, one, it won’t affect any services, and two, someone doesn’t lose their job,” Smiley said. “These city employees are our neighbors, our friends, your kids’ Little League coach. We are not going out looking to try to cut jobs and lay people off.”
The hiring freeze initiated at the start of the budget process has ended, Smiley said, as open positions are ones included in the budget.  
Meanwhile, Miller said one of the council’s priorities is finding new ways to think about revenue in Providence that don’t rely on property taxes. Both Miller and the mayor agreed that the city’s payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) agreement with Brown University, which finalized in 2023, had been struck just in time.   
“I’m certain that if we were in negotiations with the private colleges today, given the changes in the federal landscape and the new financial pressures that they’re under, that their offer would be far less than what we were able to sign two years ago,” Smiley said, but noted he was not as “satisfied with where we are with the hospitals.”
Both Care New England and Brown University Health, the state’s largest health systems, have PILOT agreements with the city.
Miller said she agreed with Smiley and characterized the PILOT agreements with local colleges as “the strongest Providence has seen.” But the city, she added, is limited in its powers over institutions like Brown, whose state charter predates that of the city itself.
“I think that we have opportunities to work with the General Assembly to think about what any nonprofit institution expanding means for our tax rolls, because Providence cannot afford to keep removing property from the tax roll,” Miller said.
The full budget is available on the city’s website, as well as a tax bill estimator tool.

(Photo by Sean D. Elliot/Getty Images)Months after hosting games for the first two rounds of the NCAA’s March Madness tournament, basketball fever has apparently returned to Providence with this question: Is Gov. Dan McKee making a full court press to lure the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun to Rhode Island’s capital city?
WPRI-12 first reported that McKee met with “an investor who’s interested in potentially purchasing and relocating the Sun to Providence” at the Amica Mutual Pavilion (AMP) on July 11. The station states that the home of the Providence College Friars and the Providence Bruins was temporarily reconfigured as a basketball stadium for the showcase.
McKee’s office did not respond when asked about the validity of the rumor, but did share a copy of the governor’s schedule with Rhode Island Current confirming he was at the arena for a “meeting and tour” from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.  
“That is the extent of the info we are going to share at this point,” Andrea Palagi, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in a phone call Tuesday.
Since 2003, the Sun has been owned by the Mohegan Tribe and plays at Mohegan Sun Arena on the tribe’s reservation, which seats 8,910 for WNBA games. The franchise was previously based in Florida, where it operated as the Orlando Miracle.
In May, Sportico reported the tribe hired investment bank Allen & Company to explore selling the team.
“Mohegan continues to evaluate all strategic opportunities in the best interest of the Connecticut Sun, [Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority], and the WNBA,” tribal spokesperson Cody Chapman said in an emailed statement. 
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said he was not involved with McKee’s meeting at the AMP and had no details.
“I only know what I read in the news,” he told reporters at the city’s budget signing Tuesday morning in his office at City Hall.
But even the prospect of getting a WNBA franchise in his city has Smiley believing Providence has the potential to have a passionate fanbase should the Sun relocate.
“Boston can have the Celtics, and we can have women’s basketball,” he said.
The Sun have qualified for the WNBA playoffs in 16 of their 21 seasons in Connecticut — winning two conference titles in 2004 and 2005. But the franchise still remains without a championship title. And the chances aren’t looking too hot this season, as the team sits at a 3-18 record as of Tuesday.
Any effort by the state to relocate the franchise to Providence would come at a time when the WNBA is seeing rapid growth and popularity in recent years, particularly following the emergence of star players like Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever in 2024. 
Last year, league officials inked an 11-year TV deal valued at $2.2 billion and has expanded to its 13 franchises in San Francisco — with plans to have 18 teams playing by 2030.
“The WNBA is in an explosive growth state right now,” University of Rhode Island marketing professor Dan Sheinin said in an interview. “I’m sure the governor sees this as a way to kind of reframe and rebrand the way people think about Providence and Rhode Island.”

Successfully courting the Sun’s relocation could help the state rebound from the Pawtucket Red Sox’s relocation to Worcester in 2021 — though the state did gain a professional soccer franchise last year. McKee, who often bills himself as the coach of “Team Rhode Island,” could see his re-election prospects improve, Sheinin said.
“There’s absolutely no question,” he said. “That’s something tangible and could be very meaningful to the population.”
Sheinin said a move to Rhode Island would give the franchise more centralized to New England —short of relocating to Boston — and could help the Sun build a broader regional identity beyond just Connecticut.
“It’s harder for people in New England — especially northern New England, Boston, etc. — to identify with the Sun,” he said. “Anything in Connecticut can’t escape New York.”
But the state’s size may be a hindrance to securing a professional sports team — especially at a time the WNBA is looking to get bigger, Sheinin argued. And if McKee is serious about courting the franchise, he said the state will need to put together a compelling economic package that may include upgrades to the AMP, which was opened in 1971.
“A lot of newer stadiums are being built as part of a center that has retail, restaurants and bars,” Sheinin said. 
The state would also need to prove that Providence can generate more revenue for the team than it would remaining in Connecticut. In June, Forbes ranked the Sun as the 11th most valuable WNBA franchise, valuing the team at $200 million, with $14 million in annual revenue.
Still, Sheinin said he believed Rhode Island’s small size would be outweighed by a passionate fanbase for the only pro team in town.

(Photo by Kyle Martin for the North Dakota Monitor)Two lawsuits involving pipeline company Summit Carbon Solutions and the North Dakota Public Service Commission have been combined.
The PSC, which approved a route permit for Iowa-based Summit last year, requested that the two lawsuits be merged.
One lawsuit is led by Burleigh County, the other by a group of landowners who oppose Summit’s proposed five-state carbon capture pipeline that would end at an underground storage area northwest of Bismarck.
CO2 storage law challenged in North Dakota Supreme Court hearing

In requesting the consolidation, attorney Zachary Pelham, representing the PSC, said “the two appeals are a mirror image.”
Attorneys for Burleigh County and Summit Carbon Solutions did not object to the consolidation.
Among the issues raised in the cases is a challenge to the PSC’s ruling that states zoning rules trump county zoning ordinances on pipelines. Plaintiffs also argue the agency did not give enough consideration to the safety of residents along the pipeline route.
Another pending lawsuit involves a landowner challenge to the North Dakota Industrial Commission’s approval of permanent underground storage permits for Summit.
Summit plans to gather carbon dioxide emissions from ethanol plants in five states, including in Iowa and one in eastern North Dakota, and use pipelines to send the CO2 to a sequestration area in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties
In another case, the North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments in April in a challenge to a state law related to underground storage of CO2.
Summit describes its project as the world’s largest carbon capture and storage project. It would take advantage of federal tax credits that promote reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Supporters say it would help ethanol producers compete in the low-carbon fuel market and benefit farmers who supply the ethanol plants with corn.
In addition to North Dakota, Summit has obtained a state pipeline permit in Iowa and approval for a short section of the route in Minnesota. Summit has so far been unsuccessful in South Dakota. Nebraska has no state agency that handles CO2 pipeline projects.

July 15, 2025 | ScreenshotA former Republican lawmaker, gubernatorial candidate and election conspiracy theorist on Tuesday asked a Michigan House of Representatives committee to request federal investigations against three of Michigan’s top ranking Democrats, whom he has repeatedly accused of fraud and other crimes, incuding bribery.
Pat Colbeck, who served in the Michigan Senate from 2011 to 2019 and sought the Republican nomination for governor in 2018, presented a laundry list of election integrity concerns to the House Election Integrity Committee, chaired by state Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin).
The three officials Colbeck asked to be investigated include Attorney General Dana Nessel, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Supreme Court Justice Kyra Harris Bolden.
Nessel spokesperson Danny Wimmer, in a statement to Michigan Advance, dismissed Colbeck’s claims and accusations as “unhinged.”
“Anyone familiar with Patrick Colbeck’s post-legislative career of peddling unhinged and unproven election conspiracies can see how absurd it was to host him before a House committee,” Wimmer said. “His efforts have been rejected time and again by election experts and the courts. The fact that this committee entertained his testimony suggests they are fundamentally unserious about strengthening the laws that defend our elections. Attorney General Nessel stands by her comprehensive, significant work in investigating and prosecuting election law violations during her tenure in office.”
Benson spokesperson Angela Benander told the Advance that the committee was “doing a real disservice to Michigan voters by continuing to platform these widely discredited self-appointed ‘experts’ and allowing them to rehash their failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election.”
“It’s July 2025 – why are they spending taxpayer resources and valuable time on these debunked conspiracy theories? While everyone else is rightly focused on passing a budget and on legislation that solves problems for people in Michigan, the [House Election Integrity Committee] has hosted a parade of extremists to spout false information about our state’s secure elections,” Benander said. “It’s been seven months, and the committee has not introduced any legislation based on these presentations. The people of Michigan deserve to know why the Chair and the Speaker are letting a small group of social media-based election deniers drive the agenda.”
Benander went on to say that Michigan’s elections were secure, the results were accurate and that the Michigan Department of State was ready to work with the House on tangible improvements to election systems when the House was also ready.
A request for comment on Colbeck’s commentary sent to Bolden was not returned at the time of publication.
Colbeck, since the end of his political career, has been at the forefront of election conspiracy theories surrounding the outcome of the 2020 election, in which he claimed election officials at the former TCF Center – now Huntington Center – Detroit counting location connected election equipment to the internet. Colbeck claimed there was evidence of vote manipulation, assertions that were later reviewed in court and deemed unsubstantiated.
Republicans since that election have sought to relitigate the 2020 election results and have dedicated much time since retaking the Michigan House in 2024 to bolstering election security based on some of those past claims.
Colbeck’s invitation to the House Election Integrity Committee recounted many of his past claims, but also included new claims that the Michigan Bureau of Elections unlawfully destroyed election records, which Colbeck said was admitted to under oath in Hillsdale County court proceedings.
The former legislator was referring to the case against Stefanie Lambert Junttila, who is facing trial in Oakland County for alleged attempts to access and tamper with voting tabulators following the 2020 election. She also faces charges in Hillsdale, where it was alleged that she and former Adams Township Clerk Stephanie Scott permitted an unauthorized computer examiner to access voter data concerning the 2020 election, which included non-public information.
Junttila requested to adjourn the start of Monday’s trial in Oakland, citing preliminary examination testimony in the in Hillsdale case from Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater that she said contradicted statements he made to a grand jury, which indicted Junttila alongside former Republican candidate for attorney general Matt DePerno and former State Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) for allegedly tampering with election equipment.
After recounting his various concerns with Michigan’s election systems, Colbeck said he was recommending the Legislature pass new laws to fix the problems he highlighted, subpoena officials for additional information and request federal investigations against Nessel, Benson and Bolden.
Colbeck, based on the so-called evidence he brought with him to the committee meeting, asked the House to request a federal investigation into Nessel for fraud, willful neglect of duty, and intimidation of election officials in the wake of the 2020 election.
He accused Benson of deprivation of rights under the color of law, bribery, fraud, willful neglect of duty, intimidation of election officials, and the unlawful destruction of election records.
Colbeck similarly accused Bolden of bribery, which was connected to his claim against Benson. Colbeck has for months claimed that Benson gave Bolden’s campaign for Michigan Supreme Court, in a bid to retain her seat after being appointed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, $82,500 while the high court was gearing up to hear the O’Halloran v. Benson election lawsuit.
Colbeck said the opinion in the case, which was favorable to Benson and her department, was written by Bolden. Colbeck claimed that was evidence of bribery.
“I can’t get into the mens rea [or the guilt of mind] on this. I don’t know if she had the intent of it being a bribe or not,” Colbeck said. “I don’t have access to those communications. All I have is FOIA access.”
Colbeck also said he requested the same kind of investigation into that political donation from the Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission, the Judicial Tenure Commission and now federal authorities, in addition to his request to the House on Tuesday.
On the subpoena front, which the House has shown a recent willingness to flex against Benson and Nessel, in particular, Colbeck suggested that the House seek to obtain the state’s Qualified Voter File transaction log and accountancy of data formatting errors.
“I think it’s important for us to know who, when, what and how these records were actually updated,” Colbeck said. “I do applaud the representatives who support the issuing of subpoenas for the election training materials, and if you recall the House asked nicely for these materials before being forced to issue a subpoena.”
He said that everyday citizens also hit brick walls when trying to request this information via the Freedom of Information Act, and that when requests are denied, “we often have to take the advice of Jocelyn Benson’s lawyer and sue for access to the information.”
“That approach is often expensive and time consuming,” Colbeck said. “Legislative subpoenas offer an alternative to this burdensome approach to election transparency.”
The data formatting error request would include seeking coding scripts, raw data and communications including Bureau of Elections chat records.
He said access to this information could validate or invalidate Benson’s narrative on the security of past elections.
In questions for Colbeck, state Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren) questioned his commitment to transparency and asked why he hadn’t sought to relitigate other elections, like his own election in 2011, the 2016 and the 2024 elections, in which Republicans surged and saw President Donald Trump ascend to the Oval Office.
In response, Colbeck said he would entertain a full audit of those elections, saying that was the heart of his request to the Legislature.
“For the record, I called for an audit of the 2016 election. I’ve called for an audit in the wake of the 2024 election,” Colbeck said. “What’s happening right now is that we have this big, little mystery box called the election system, and I think it needs to be opened up with a bright flashlight, and we should see it across the board and examine every single election.”
Xiong countered that there were real threats to American and Michigan democracy on the horizon. She worried about election issues in the 2026 election, which will occur with Republicans in charge of all levers of the federal government, and questioned why Colbeck was trying to relitigate the past.
“I did see your suggestions,” Xiong said. “You were a senator once. How come you didn’t introduce legislation back then to fix these issues? When did they start?”

Colbeck said he attempted to hold a committee hearing like the one the House was holding on Tuesday, parsing various anomalies in the 2016 election, saying that his staffers had discovered discrepancies in the pollbook numbers and the ballot containers.
He went on to say that his musings on election security defied party affiliations, because it was his own then-Senate majority leader, Arlan Meekof (R-Grand Haven), who he said prevented him from holding that hearing and having a frank discussion.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-15-at-4.40.11 PM-e1752612120987-1024x664.png,,,2025-07-15 17:11:37.293399

Shane Baker  questioned a UK course  in Gender and Women's Studies during a legislative committee meeting Tuesday. On Feb. 19, above, Baker presents a resolution to return a granite display of  the Ten Commandments monument to the Capitol.  (LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A Republican lawmaker questioned a University of Kentucky administrator Tuesday about a course offering in the university’s Gender and Women’s Studies program.
During a legislative committee meeting, Rep. Shane Baker of Somerset read from a course description that begins: “The 14th Amendment of the Constitution guarantees equal protection under the laws, but as Black Lives Matter and other protest movements indicate, this promise remains unfulfilled.” The course is listed for the 2025 fall semester. 
Baker asked if the course is being offered.
UK Provost and Co-Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Robert DiPaola replied that while he did not know the status of the Gender and Women’s Studies courses, university websites are still being updated. A search of all eight Kentucky public universities’ websites show most of the universities have courses that focus on Gender and Women’s Studies. 
  Dr. Robert S. DiPaola is UK’s provost and co-executive vice president for health affairs.
“Could you check on that and let us know if those are still offered?” Baker said. “And help us understand the value of those and why the taxpayer dollars should be expended on those things.”
The exchange came as the Budget Review Subcommittee on Education heard from higher education officials about their campuses’ compliance with a recently passed state law that bars diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in higher education. 
Representatives of the state’s eight public universities and the Kentucky Community and Technical College System assured lawmakers that their institutions are in compliance with House Bill 4 passed by the Republican-controlled legislature earlier this year over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto.
The institutions said they achieved compliance through actions such as eliminating diversity offices and adopting viewpoint neutrality policies. The universities are also in the midst of scrubbing and updating their websites to reflect the new viewpoint neutrality policies and comply with the state law, university officials said.
Murray State University’s new president also came under questioning.
Sen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, a co-chair of the committee, asked Murray President Ron Patterson about a comment he made regarding DEI reported on radio station WKMS “DEI is going to look different,” Patterson had said, “but we continue to provide those support services. It’s just going to be in a different way.” Patterson’s academic experience includes roles in admissions, athletics, enrollment and DEI programs.”
  Murray State University President Ron Patterson
Rawlings said what Patters said is “a little concerning.” 
Patterson told the committee, “Our institution has been there for 103 years, providing strong support for student services to the western portion of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and we’ll continue, again, to uphold and enhance their efforts — their student experience — to support their success, and that’s what that statement means.” 
Under HB 4, each of Kentucky’s higher education institutions was required to adopt a viewpoint neutrality policy by June 30 that “prohibits discrimination on the basis of an individual’s political or social viewpoint and promotes intellectual diversity within the institution.” The policies must be published online and in student and faculty handbooks. 
The committee also asked about any potential savings the universities may have after eliminating DEI programs and training. 
Western Kentucky University saved about $13,000 annually after no longer supporting DEI-related training or conferences. KCTCS is projecting a cost-savings of about $2.5 million annually, but much of that has been redirected elsewhere within its budget to support general student success. 
However, the University of Louisville hired additional legal counsel to review its compliance with HB 4. Executive Vice President of Legal, Governance, and External Relations Angela Curry said that during the implementation of the law, several members of the university’s legal office were spending about half of their work time “reviewing job descriptions, analyzing policies, editing gift agreements and answering many, many questions from community stakeholders.” Because of the need to ensure ongoing compliance with the state law, UofL decided to hire an additional attorney. 
University officials noted that the University of Kentucky, Northern Kentucky University and Kentucky State University had closed their diversity offices ahead of the passage of HB 4. Morehead State University President Jay Morgan said the institution did not have a diversity office. 
Patterson told lawmakers that some offices at Murray State have been renamed to “better reflect their responsibilities.” 
After the universities’ presentations, Michael Frazier, the executive director of the Kentucky Student Rights Coalition, addressed the committee. He was supportive of HB 4 during the legislative session and appeared alongside the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, during a committee hearing. 
Frazier said that as a result of HB 4, Kentucky became the first state in the country to adopt viewpoint neutrality policies at each public university and college. However, there’s still “some work” to do when it comes to data and reporting, he added, particularly on how to assist low-income and underrepresented students and reexamining the state’s performance-based funding model for universities.

Rawlings said at the end of the meeting that the information that lawmakers have reviewed show that “DEI has not delivered measurable benefits for Kentucky students, especially disadvantaged students.” 
“What began with good intentions has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry rife with tokenism, lacking clear metrics and producing no meaningful improvement in student outcomes,” Rawlings said, adding that higher education must “return to what works — accountability, transparent results and evidence-based policies.” 
The Kentucky law also has a reporting component. The universities are directed to provide students, faculty, and staff with a survey in the fall to “assess intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity.” The Council on Postsecondary Education will publish and develop the survey this October. 
DEI has come under scrutiny from Republicans at the national level. President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing the U.S. Department of Education to overhaul university and college accreditation programs to root out DEI standards. The Trump administration has sought more influence over universities nationally by threatening to take away federal funding.

(Getty Images)New Mexico environment and health departments on Tuesday announced it will offer free domestic well water testing to the first 100 participants in Mora from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on July 26.



				Testing will be available 10 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. in Mora, at the Contractor Connects hosted by New Mexico’s Disaster Case Management Team, located at the Mora Independent Schools 518 Ranger Dr, Mora, NM.			


“Private well owners in San Miguel and Mora Counties can come to this water fair and find out more about the quality of their household drinking water,” Ground Water Quality Bureau Chief Justin Ball said in a statement. “Free well water testing events give our communities peace of mind by helping families understand what’s in their water and how to keep it safe, at no cost to them.”
Participants will receive their results within two to three weeks, the department said. The testing “allows well owners to measure pH, specific conductance and levels of nitrates in their water, two measurements that are crucial to maintaining safe drinking water,” the news release said.
The state environment department noted it has tested 175 private drinking water wells at water fairs in the last year, with results available to view online.


How to collect water sample:

Let the water run for two to three minutes first
Fill a clean glass or plastic container without any odors with at least a quart or liter of the well water.
For homes with whole house filtration systems, collect the water at the well head prior to any filtration or softener systems, if possible
Fill the container with water as close to the time of testing as possible



More about the water fair program is available online.
The state also tests water from public water systems periodically, the results of which can be viewed on its Drinking Water Watch website.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)INDIANOLA — Members of the Simpson College community gathered Tuesday to welcome their new interim president to a near-empty — for now — campus, where she and other leaders honored late President Jay Byers and vowed to build off the legacy he left, even amid challenges facing higher education.
Susan Stuebner was selected for the interim president position after a national search and will officially start July 28, according to a news release announcing her selection. Acting board of trustees chair Terry Lillis said Tuesday the search yielded several candidates, five of whom were interviewed then narrowed down to three for campus visits.
Stuebner said when she visited the Indianola campus, she could see herself belonging in both the campus and community.
“I could sense immediately that the people of Simpson are what make it so special,” Stuebner said. “As I learned about the opportunities and challenges the college faces, I also felt that my experience could help us as we partner together to make Simpson even stronger.”

Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire, where Stuebner most recently worked and served for eight years as president, is facing many of the same challenges as Simpson College, she said. Those include a looming demographic cliff, fewer high school students choosing college after graduation and “the erosion of the public’s view of the value of higher education.”
In terms of financial struggles many private colleges face, Stuebner said “we can’t cut our way out of issues.” At Colby-Sawyer College, Stuebner said she worked to find new revenue streams, using the college’s most popular major in nursing to pursue outside partnerships in health care and nursing-related fields.
“That’s not necessarily the right fit for Simpson, but the same model would apply,” she said.
Stuebner will also focus on fundraising during her year as interim president. People don’t always understand the direct impact to students a donation to a small, private university can have, she said, and part of her job will be helping potential donors know this and learn more about the college.
One aspect of Simpson’s culture Stuebner said she appreciates is the institution’s and board’s commitment to inclusion and belonging, as well as to civil discourse. The realm of higher education is one of the rare areas where civil discourse can take place, she said, and while the college community needs to be “thoughtful” about how it proceeds amid increased scrutiny on colleges and universities, she’s happy these values are still present and important on campus.
In the months since Byers was found dead in the president’s campus residence in April, acting president Terry Handley said things have been difficult for the “very tight-knit campus community,” but he and his colleagues are excited to see Stuebner come to campus. Lillis said during his remarks the board was looking for someone who recognized the grief and healing process the campus community is undergoing following Byers’s death but could also look forward into Simpson’s future and have the financial and personal skills to ensure it is bright.
“It’s early, but I have a really good feeling about Sue and her ability to connect with people,” Handley said. “I just find her to be very, very genuine, very personal, but also a solid decision maker.”
Whether Stuebner stays on as the college’s official president, rather than interim, is a decision both she and the board, in consultation with the campus community, will make together, Handley said. According to the new release announcing Stuebner’s selection as interim president, the college’s board of trustees will conduct a review of Stuebner’s work later in the year and discuss a potential “mutual interest” in keeping her in the position permanently.
If the possibility of her staying on as president becomes a real option, Stuebner said she’d love the opportunity.
“I think Simpson is poised to emerge from this external challenging landscape with a compelling mission, successful education models and a very bright future,” Stuebner said. “It is, again, the people of this place that are going to help us grow and survive.”

,DC,2025-07-15 20:27:17+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Education Department in the middle of a growing tug-of-war between Trump, Democrats",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/education-department-middle-growing-tug-war-between-trump-democrats,,"WASHINGTON  — The U.S. Department of Education has emerged as central in the struggle over control of the power of the purse in the nation’s capital.Democrats in Congress are pushing back hard on the Trump administration’s freeze of $6.8 billion in funds for after-school programs and more at public schools, some of which open their doors a few weeks from now. California alone lost access to $939 million and every state is seeing millions of dollars frozen.At the same time, the Supreme Court on Monday slammed the door on judicial orders that blocked the dismantling of the 45-year-old agency that Congress created and funds.The nation’s highest court cleared the way for the administration to proceed, for now, with mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the Department of Education that President Donald Trump ordered earlier this year.In her scathing dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that “the majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave.”Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote that the president “must take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not set out to dismantle them.”“That basic rule undergirds our Constitution’s separation of powers,” she wrote. “Yet today, the majority rewards clear defiance of that core principle with emergency relief.”Just a day after the Supreme Court’s decision, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters at a Tuesday press conference that while he hasn’t had a chance to digest the Supreme Court’s order, he also knows that “since its creation, the Department of Education has been wielded by the executive branch.”“I think that was the intent of Congress, as I understood it back then. We have a large say in that, but we’re going to coordinate that with the White House,” the Louisiana Republican said.“If we see that the separation of powers is being breached in some way, we’ll act, but I haven’t seen that yet,” he added.Letters from Democrats on frozen fundsTwo letters from Senate and House Democrats demanding the administration release the $6.8 billion in federal funds for various education initiatives also depict the Education Department as a key part of the tussle between the executive branch and Congress.Just a day ahead of the July 1 date when these funds are typically sent out as educators plan for the coming school year, the department informed states that it would be withholding funding for programs, including before- and after-school programs, migrant education, English-language learning and adult education and literacy, among other initiatives.Thirty-two senators and 150 House Democrats wrote to Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought last week asking to immediately unfreeze those dollars they say are being withheld “illegally.”“It is unacceptable that the administration is picking and choosing what parts of the appropriations law to follow, and you must immediately implement the entire law as Congress intended and as the oaths you swore require you to do,” the senators wrote in their letter.The respective top Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and its subcommittee overseeing Education Department funding, Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, led the letter, alongside Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.In the lower chamber, House Democrats wrote that “without these funds, schools are facing difficult and unnecessary decisions on programs for students and teachers.”“No more excuses — follow the law and release the funding meant for our schools, teachers, and families,” they added.Georgia’s Rep. Lucy McBath led the letter, along with the respective top Democrats on the House Committee on Education and Workforce, its subcommittee on early childhood, elementary and secondary education and its panel on higher education and workforce development: Reps. Bobby Scott of Virginia, Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon and Alma Adams of North Carolina.Democratic attorneys general, governors file suitMeanwhile, a coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Monday over those withheld funds, again arguing that Congress has the power to direct funding.The states suing include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, both Democrats, also signed onto the suit filed in a Rhode Island federal court.“Not only does Congress require that Defendants make funds available for obligation to the States, Congress, in conjunction with (Education Department) regulations, also directs the timing of when those funds should be made available,” the coalition wrote.An analysis earlier in July by New America, a left-leaning think tank, found that the top five school districts with the greatest total funding risk per-pupil include those in at least two red states: Montana’s Cleveland Elementary School District, Kester Elementary School District and Grant Elementary School District, along with Oregon’s Yoncalla School District 32 and Texas’ Boles Independent School District.The think tank notes that program finance data was not available for Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Wisconsin.",,,,2025-07-15 17:11:37.293399

Alex Wong/Getty ImagesDevices that convert semi-automatic weapons into machine guns will no longer be redistributed in Minnesota following a lawsuit from Attorney General Keith Ellison against the Trump administration. 
Ellison sued the administration with 15 other attorneys general after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, agreed to stop enforcing a federal rule prohibiting forced reset triggers. These devices, which significantly increase a gun’s rate of fire, were previously classified as machine guns by the ATF; machine guns are illegal to possess under federal and state law. 
Lawsuits filed during the Biden administration brought the ban on forced reset triggers into dispute. While one federal judge in New York upheld the prohibition, a Texas judge ruled that the devices aren’t machine guns under federal law. That ruling was then under appeal. 
In May, the Trump administration announced a settlement, causing the ATF to stop enforcing the ban on forced reset triggers. The ATF planned to redistribute the devices — which the agency previously called machine guns — that it had already confiscated. 
Minnesota and the 15 other states involved in Ellison’s lawsuit will now be exempt from the results of that settlement. Rare Breed Triggers, the largest seller of forced reset triggers in the U.S., also agreed not to sell the devices in Minnesota and the other coalition states. 
Ellison’s lawsuit argued that the use of machine-gun conversion devices has been fueling gun violence. The ATF recovered 5,454 of these devices between 2017 and 2021, a 570% increase over the previous five-year period. Firearm homicides increased between 2018 and 2022 in Minnesota; most gun homicides did not involve the devices, and the state’s overall firearm mortality rate remains low compared to the rest of the country. 
“Machine guns have no place on Minnesota streets, nor do devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into machine guns,” Ellison said in a press release. “By making firearms far more deadly, these devices threaten the safety of both the public and members of law enforcement.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-624271200-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-07-15 17:11:37.293399

(Karen Kasmauski | Getty Images)Another miner has been added as a plaintiff in a class action suit pending against the federal Department of Health and Human Services over its prior shutdown of an agency crucial to helping coal miners protect themselves against dangerous black lung disease.
Matthew Ward, a coal miner since 1993 who lives in Mingo County, will represent the class in the suit alongside Harry Wiley, the case’s lead plaintiff, per court documents filed last week.
The case was initially filed on behalf of Wiley and coal miners in similar positions who, because of the federal government’s shutdown of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in April, had to go without services that were mandated to be offered through congressional action.
The shutdown saw every worker from the agency’s Respiratory Health Division and the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program let go. NIOSH, through those programs, is the only entity capable of certifying X-ray results showing that an active miner has been diagnosed with black lung disease. Those certified X-ray results are the only way for miners with black lung to request a Part 90 transfer, which allows them to move to a less dusty part of a mine without negative consequences like a cut in hours, pay or retribution from mine operators.
The Part 90 program was created through Congress in amendments to the Federal Coal Mine and Safety Act of 1969. The program effectively ended in April without an act of Congress through cuts by the newly created federal Department of Government Efficiency when all workers within the division were put on administrative leave pending permanent firings.
A hearing for the case was held in May. Attorneys for the coal miners argued that the nature in which the NIOSH cuts occurred and the consequences of those cuts — leaving coal miners without services the government is congressionally obligated to provide — was illegal. Attorneys for the federal government argued the cuts were “temporary,” but offered no evidence of when the services would return or in what form.
In response to those arguments, federal U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction on May 13 ordering a “full restoration” of services at the Respiratory Health Division and the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program.
Despite two months passing since that order, work at the surveillance program has still slowed and several of the functions it’s responsible for providing — including free black lung screenings for active miners through a mobile clinic — have yet to resume, per West Virginia Public Broadcasting.
Attorneys in last week’s filing argued that Ward’s experiences were similar to those of Wiley, the case’s lead plaintiff, and as such were appropriate to add in the suit as part of an amended complaint. Ward also testified at May’s hearing but was not included as a potential named plaintiff on the case until last week.
According to filings, Ward was diagnosed with complicated black lung disease in March 2025 at the New River Clinic, which is a partner clinic for the surveillance program. While he’s out of work temporarily due to injury, he would like to return to work in a less dusty part of the coal mine to not exacerbate his progressing black lung disease.
To do such, Ward filed in April 2025 to request a Part 90 transfer. According to the filings, he has yet to hear back from DHHS regarding his application or the status of his request.
Black lung disease has no cure. The best intervention, according to experts, is to limit exposure to dangerous silica dust that is becoming more common in mines as miners are forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone to reach the little coal that remains in existing seams.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of Central Appalachian coal miners are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. 
One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
The resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before due to the increased exposure to silica dust.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith is among several Hoosier Republicans backing a new lawsuit against the state GOP, claiming that party leaders “undermined the rights of delegates” by making convention changes beyond their authority.
Joseph Bortka, a 2024 state convention delegate and current Marion County Republican precinct committeeman, filed the lawsuit Sunday in Marion County Superior Court. 
The suit names the Indiana Republican State Committee, 2022 convention chair Ed Simcox and 2024 convention chair Randy Head as defendants.
The complaint alleges that party leadership repeatedly silenced delegates, bypassed convention procedures, and rewrote internal rules without consent.
“It’s fundamentally a shareholder suit, the delegates as shareholders and the State Committee as the board of directors,” Bortka said in a statement. “When the State Committee frustrates attempts to rally the Party’s collective will by silencing properly brought motions on the convention floor without a vote, or rewrites the rules to undermine the will of its Republican membership, they violate their fiduciary duties to the Party.”
The complaint alleges that party leadership “refused to allow” certain issues to be voted on by the convention — including motions and resolutions proposed by delegates — while “misleading the convention” about their rights and changing rules in ways that “undermine the rights of delegates and the rights of the convention as a body.”
Story continues below.
COMPLAINT
 
The lawsuit specifically pointed to proposals that sought to amend party convection rules and platform positions.
Among other claims, Bortka argues that recent rule changes made by the state committee — including the removal of Robert’s Rules of Order as the convention’s procedural guide and blocking motions from being heard — are part of a broader attempt to consolidate power at the expense of delegates’ rights. 
The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment affirming that the biennial convention is the party’s highest authority and an injunction preventing future convention chairs from “arbitrarily blocking delegate action.”
“No other recourse exists to resolve this dispute save for the court,” Bortka wrote in the complaint, citing failed attempts to seek remedy through internal party channels.
The filing does not seek monetary damages but instead requests the court enforce internal party rules and grant access to party records for transparency.
Various Republican activists and organizations — including Beckwith, the Hoosier Freedom Caucus, Indiana Republican Assembly, and Tea Party groups — are supportive of the lawsuit, according to a press release issued by Bortka. 
Neither the lieutenant governor’s office nor the Indiana Republican Party responded to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s request for comment.

He confessed to sexually assaulting and murdering 5-year-old Zoey Felix in October 2023 in a homeless encampment in Topeka. (Pool photo by Evert Nelson/Topeka Capital-Journal)TOPEKA — A perpetually homeless man abused by his parents and shuffled as a youth among more than 17 foster homes and two psychiatric hospitals received a life sentence in prison Tuesday without possibility of parole for half a century in the rape and murder of a Topeka preschool girl entrusted to his care.
Shawnee County District Judge Jessica Heinen ordered Mickel Cherry, who admitted to smothering 5-year-old Zoey Felix in 2023, to serve consecutive life sentences requiring incarceration for a minimum of 50 years before being evaluated for possible release. Defense counsel recommended their developmentally disabled client serve the pair of life sentences concurrently so parole could be an option after 25 years. The prosecution argued the extreme depravity of the crimes necessitated at least 50 years behind bars.
Cherry pleaded guilty to both offenses in exchange for the district attorney not pursuing the death penalty.
“The evidence shows you violently, forcibly and inhumanely raped Zoey,” Heinen told Cherry at close of a heart-wrenching two-day hearing. “You then murdered Zoey.”
Heinen, who had the authority to order concurrent or consecutive life sentences, said her decision reflected Cherry’s attempt to conceal his involvement by blaming an imaginary Mexican man and lying repeatedly to Topeka law enforcement officers. In a police station interrogation on the day of Zoey’s death, Cherry confessed and has remained at the Shawnee County Jail for the past 650 days.
The judge asked Cherry if he wanted to make a statement to the court, and his response — “No, Ma’am” — frustrated some family members looking for a glimmer of remorse. They had spent two days studying his mostly blank expression and tendency to bury his chin in his chest. He spoke periodically to his attorneys, but made few hand gestures given that his wrists were handcuffed to a chain linked to ankle shackles.
Zeke Felix, Zoey’s father, said in an interview that he wasn’t content with the decision of District Attorney Mike Kagay to set aside the capital punishment option. He understood there were potential legal complications with seeking the death penalty because of Cherry’s diminished mental capacity, but thought an attempt should have been made to achieve what he viewed as full justice for his daughter.
“I’m not content, but satisfied,” said Zeke Felix, who sat during the proceeding in the front row behind prosecutors. “The death penalty was off the table.”

‘Conscious decision’
Kagay, who handled the sentencing phase with two colleagues from the district attorney’s office, said there was no easy way to talk about what the defendant did to the victim. He said in most criminal cases there were thin slices of humanity or fractured pieces of a puzzle to provide context or explain the horror.
“Not here,” he said. “Not in this case.”
Kagay said it was outrageous that Cherry, while divulging how he squeezed the life from Zoey, informed a Topeka police detective that sometimes a “good person” such as himself committed senseless crimes.
“Mickel Cherry made the conscious decision to kill Zoey. Why? In a failed attempt to avoid responsibility,” Kagay said. “The most egregious crimes demand the heaviest penalties. Each of these crimes call out today for justice.”
The district attorney responded to defense witness testimony and court filings dedicated to outlining how Cherry emerged from a Texas childhood marked by abuse and mental instability to land in an isolated Kansas tent encampment where Zoey’s life ended. Kagay conceded state foster care systems allowed children to fall through the cracks, but he rejected that required mercy beyond setting aside the death penalty for Cherry.
“The law has already shown him clemency,” Kagay said. “There is no question who is to blame here. No failure of any system caused him to rape and murder Zoey Felix.”

‘Heart of the issue’
Defense attorney Peter Conley, who is the state’s deputy capital defender, presented evidence Cherry endured persistent abuse while a minor. There were Texas reports showing his mother put a lit cigarette to his head, leaving a permanent scar. Domestic violence was a routine occurrence in his parents’ home, reports showed. He was beaten with sticks, fists and even a hammer by adults in his life.
The large but incomplete file on Cherry’s upbringing indicated he lived in places where adults required disobedient children to stand in a cold shower all night or remain crouched in stress positions for hours. Elsewhere, he was forced to spend long periods of time in a yard with a dangerous dog. He was adopted at age 14, but was subsequently left on his own at 18 without the skills to live independently.
“The system failed him utterly and completely,” said Beth Robinson, a professor at Colorado Christian University who was the first Texas counselor Cherry encountered when taken from his parents at age 5. “He needed a whole different type of therapy and intervention.”
She testified for the defense that one-third of children who spent extended time in foster care ended up homeless and about half eventually found their way into criminal entanglements.
Conley said it was important the sentencing judge in Kansas respond to the odious offenses committed by Cherry by imposing a life sentence. It was equally significant for the court to factor into the equation the role of a dysfunctional Texas foster care system as well as the Kansas Department for Children and Families’ failure to sufficiently respond to reports Zoey was being neglected, he said.
That history argued for a sentence that provided Cherry a thin but reasonable hope of walking out of a prison in something closer to 25 years instead of 50 years, Conley said.
“The heart of this issue is DCF had information about unsafe environments for Zoey Felix and didn’t do enough about it,” Conley said. “Actions have consequences. Mickel needs to be punished.

Right at the top of state government, Gov. Jared Polis is among the most unreliable allies against attacks on the people of Colorado, and other state and local officials have shown that legal defenses are only so good as officials are willing to assert them. At a time when righteous resolve is the only moral response to federal banditry, officials in Colorado too often have helped the bad guys.

The most spectacular example of this failure comes in the case of Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoenas. In April, the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment received a subpoena from ICE seeking personal information on sponsors of immigrant children. Release of the information could improperly expose dozens of residents to immigration enforcement.
Colorado law is supposed to protect against this sort of disclosure. It prohibits state personnel from sharing personal identifying information with federal immigration officers except in response to a court-issued subpoena or to assist with a federal criminal investigation.
Instead of upholding the law, Polis claimed to have interpreted the subpoena as being issued as part of a criminal investigation, contrary to all indications, and ordered the information to be released.
A state employee, Scott Moss, sued Polis over this decision, and it was revealed in court that the Labor and Employment Department had already received and complied with another ICE subpoena in March. Then The Denver Post last week reported that the department has actually received at least four federal subpoenas related to immigration enforcement. A department spokesperson told the Post that it is following a court ruling against certain employees being made to comply with the Moss case subpoena. But as for the other three subpoenas, the state has disclosed nothing about its response, since the subpoenas purportedly involve “active investigations.”
Given this lack of transparency and Polis’ eagerness to accommodate ICE, it’s fair to assume the state has provided ICE everything it’s asked for that’s not specifically barred in the Moss case.
Such intergovernmental cooperation might be forgiven in normal times with normal agencies. But the times are not normal — the Trump administration behaves like it’s unconstrained by laws or basic human decency. And ICE is not a normal agency — its unaccountable agents defy court orders, dispense with due process, kidnap people off the streets and disappear them to brutal foreign facilities.
Someday ICE will be abolished, and Americans will remember it with singular shame. Why Polis would make himself complicit with it — even in apparent violation of state law — is a question that should haunt the rest of his career.
But he is not the only authority in Colorado helping ICE terrorize communities.
The Loveland Police Department has allowed the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to access data from the city’s Flock Safety surveillance cameras, and as 9News learned last month, an ATF agent has searched the city’s Flock data on behalf of ICE. This breach at the very least exposes a loophole in the state law against information-sharing with ICE, if not an outright violation.
Last month a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy pulled over Caroline Dias Goncalves, a Utah college student, in Grand Junction. The deputy let her go with a warning, but not before asking her, “Where are you from? You’ve got a little bit of an accent,” extracting from her that she was born in Brazil. A short time later, federal immigration enforcement agents detained her.
Sheriff’s office representatives later revealed that the deputy had shared information about Goncalves on a Signal group chat with federal authorities. Even the sheriff’s office acknowledged that such use of information was “contradictory to Colorado law.” 
Episodes like these are transforming American society into a nightmare of paranoia and cruelty. States authorities who accommodate federal adversaries only compound the fear. Residents deserve leaders who, in accordance with ethical behavior, not to mention the law, resist those who mean Coloradans harm.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Starting in August, low-income South Dakota families participating in a welfare program will receive less money to spend on necessities such as gas, groceries, utilities and rent. The benefit cut is the beginning of more reductions planned in the next few years.
Lawmakers on the legislative Rules Review Committee voted 4-2 on Tuesday in Pierre to support the state Department of Social Services’ plan to reduce Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits by 10%. Recipients will lose anywhere from $32 to $136 a month in benefits, depending on the size of their family. The average household will lose $51 a month.
The state will save about $1.5 million annually. It distributed $15.3 million in TANF benefits last fiscal year.
TANF is a federal-state program most commonly used to provide financial assistance to low-income families with children, on the condition that the caregiver searches or trains for a job.

The two Democrats on the committee, Rep. Erik Muckey and Sen. Liz Larson, both from Sioux Falls, voted against the cut. They argued lawmakers were not aware of the reduction in benefits when they prepared the state’s budget earlier this year, and that the plan was a misrepresentation of legislative intent. Muckey said he and other legislators on the budget committee believed the $5.3 million state funding cut would be replaced with unspent TANF funds from previous years.
Instead, the department’s plan is to use $3.8 million of unused TANF funds and the 10% benefit reduction to cover the $5.3 million cut. The department plans to gradually reduce benefits each year, said Department Secretary Matt Althoff, cushioned by some unused TANF funds, until South Dakota reduces benefits to the minimum state contribution needed to receive federal funding.

“A 35% reduction all at once is a lot more devastating to a household than is the 10% on a strategic glide or slope,” Althoff said.
Gradual cuts until the state reaches a 35% reduction add up to the average household eventually losing $180 a month in benefits.
Republicans on the committee approved the plan, saying it was up to the department how to deal with the reduction in state funds.
“In appropriations we do not get down into the most minutia of running programs,” said Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City. “We have to leave those to the agencies to a certain degree.”
Althoff told lawmakers many TANF recipients receive other support: 99% of TANF households are enrolled in Medicaid, 97% receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds, 57% live in subsidized housing and 15% are enrolled in the state Child Care Assistance program.
“TANF is not something that makes households whole,” Althoff said.

Two people spoke against the benefit cut Tuesday, including Cathy Brechtelsbauer. She opposed the proposal during its earlier public hearing in Sioux Falls as well.
“We don’t go through the whole budget process during the state Legislature and then show up in the summer and say, ‘Oh, we want to cut money and take it from children,’” Brechtelsbauer said.
The rule change also removes TANF eligibility for families who take in child relatives in situations when they’re removed from their homes by the state’s child welfare system. 
That change incentivizes caregivers to become licensed kinship caregivers with the state, Althoff said during an earlier public hearing. The current foster and kinship subsidy rate for a child in South Dakota is between $22.85 and $27.43 a day, depending on their age. That would be roughly $685.50 to $822.90 a month, per child.
Lawmakers approved rule changes in May to create the licensed kinship foster care pathway, as required by the federal government. Caregivers must meet training requirements to become a licensed kinship home, similar though less intensive than traditional foster care requirements. There are no such requirements for TANF money.
According to the department, 184 cases per month managed by the department involving families eligible for TANF could be eligible for kinship subsidies.
Families who take in kin and apply for TANF use the “side door” to receive state and federal support, Althoff said. Eliminating TANF eligibility encourages families to “come in through the front door.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/591A0329e-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-15 17:11:37.293399

(Courtesy of Jiang's campaign)A Superior Court judge partially approved a recount request filed by an Assembly candidate in Bergen County who finished less than half a point behind his closest opponent — but the candidate’s request to inspect ballots was denied.
Demarest Councilman David Jiang, a Democrat, finished third in a four-person race last month for two spots on the November ballot in the 39th Legislative District, which covers a northern swath of Bergen County. Jiang ran 137 votes behind former Woodcliff Lake Councilwoman Donna Abene.
Judge Kelly Conlon approved Jiang’s request to rerun machine vote totals but denied his push to hand review all ballots, meaning the review will be limited to in-person machine votes cast on or before election day. Mail ballots will be processed through tallying machines but won’t be subject to a hand review, said Michael Ash, who represented Jiang.
“This recount … is vital in order to ensure that the voters of District 39 have properly had their votes counted, their votes exercised, and making sure that the right individual was elected to the seat,” Ash said during arguments Tuesday.
He told the New Jersey Monitor the decision marked “a good day for the checks on Democratic processes.”
Jiang ran on a two-person slate of Assembly hopefuls backed by Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who lost his bid for the Democratic nod for governor on June 10. Jiang’s running mate, former Dumont Mayor Andrew LaBruno, finished in first place. Their two opponents ran with the backing of Bergen County’s Democratic Party.
Statewide, nine Assembly candidates backed by Fulop won their contests last month and will be on the ballot in November, though only one — LaBruno — won in a district where two party-backed candidates were also seeking the nod.
The 39th District is currently represented by two Republicans in the Assembly.
Jiang in court filings argued differences between the sum of district vote totals and contest-wide tallies justified a recount, even if that difference was far too small to change the race’s outcome. Contest totals showed Jiang with one more vote than the sum of district totals (Abene’s count was eight votes higher).
He also questioned whether the thousands of undervotes suggest errors in the vote-counting process. Undervotes happen when a voter leaves some portions of their ballot blank, such as by voting for only one candidate in a race for two seats or by voting for no candidates at all for a given office.
Deputy Attorney General Charles Shadle, who represented the Bergen County Board of Elections, said there were processes to ensure machine ballots were properly scanned and tabulated, even in the case of over- and undervotes.
He added that New Jersey law, which contains no automatic recount provision, does not entitle candidates to a recount unless they show an error was made and the error was large enough to shift election results. Jiang had not done so, Shadle argued.
The Bergen County Clerk’s Office did not oppose the recount request.
“We have found the elections in Bergen County have been fair, and we have no issue with transparency,” said Paul Kaufman, an attorney for the clerk.
Shadle said he expects the review to take two or three days to complete and could be started within the next week.

(Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service/Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1)The state of Idaho has spent almost $9.2 million fighting wildfires this season as state officials prepare for the potential for above normal wildfire activity for most of Idaho through the remainder of the summer.
So far, fewer acres of land in Idaho have burned this year compared to the same time period a year ago, Idaho Department of Lands Deputy Director Bill Haagenson told Gov. Brad Little and members of the State Board of Land Commissioners during a fire season briefing Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But with above average temperatures and below average precipitation levels that have stretched from April into July, Haagenson said the potential for wildfire is significant. 
“The significant wildland fire potential outlook for July through September shows above normal fire potential for most of Idaho,” Haggenson said.
To prepare for this year’s wildfire season, Idaho legislators set aside $40 million to pay for wildfire suppression, which was less than $58 million the state spent fighting wildfires last year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Little had requested even more money to fight wildfires, and last month the Land Board gave the state the approval to pay all of the bills for fighting wildfires – even if expenses surpass available funding provided by the Idaho Legislature. 
So far this year, the state has spent almost $9.2 million on things like use of a helicopter, water scoopers, engines, supplies and teams fighting the Old Greer and Nettleton Gulch fires that started near Orofino and Coeur d’Alene. The state anticipates being able to recover about $1.9 million of that amount for reimbursable expenses, such as sending resources to support fires the Idaho Department of Lands is not responsible for. Reimbursable costs would bring the state’s net costs to about $7.2 million so far this fire season, officials said.  
 New wildfire reported outside of Deary, Idaho

Even though fewer acres have burned, the state has reported 139 wildfires so far this year, state records show.

On Sunday, the Clover Fire burning near Naples in Boundary County threatened structures and led to evacuations that affected about 30 residences, the Idaho Department of Lands wrote in a bulletin issued Sunday. 
By Monday, crews reported making good progress on the Clover Fire, with power being restored to the area and residents being allowed to return home, although residents on Clover Lane were still under a “go” level evacuation order Monday afternoon due to their proximity to the fire.
A new wildfire, the Cherry Fire, was reported Monday night about a mile northeast of Deary, Idaho Department of Lands officials said. Deary is located in Latah County, east of Moscow.
As of Tuesday morning, about 70 people were fighting the Cherry Fire, including two 20-person handcrews, with six engines, a helicopter, two dozers and additional equipment, state officials said.  
Once again this year, a troubling wildfire trend appears to be continuing in Idaho. Year-to-date, 125 of the 139 fires the Idaho Department of Lands staff has tracked have been caused by humans, compared to just 14 fires caused by lighting, according to documents provided to Little and the Land Board on Tuesday.
State officials urge the public to make sure all campfires are doused with water and stirred repeatedly until they are dead out. Officials also ask the public to avoid parking vehicles on dry grass or other vegetation and to remove any chains that may drag behind a vehicle or trailer and could throw off a spark. 
As of Tuesday, there are no fire restrictions in place in Idaho, Haagenson said.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)I am the founder of Planson International Corporation, a family business based in New Gloucester. We supply computer equipment to the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations that support education, health, agriculture, food security, development, and emergency response. Our technology directly supports children impacted by natural disasters and conflicts — and our work is being threatened by efforts to block congressionally approved foreign aid spending.
Companies build market diversification into their business model to survive and grow. Federal investments in foreign aid broaden revenue sources for American businesses. These revenue streams are currently at risk as the U.S. Senate on Tuesday is set to advance a so-called rescissions package that would block billions in spending. This package would drastically cut foreign aid that Congress has always supported. It would weaken the position of the United States in export trade and be detrimental to local economies and small businesses. We must stop this package from becoming law. 
Our workforce’s expertise and ingenuity deliver lifesaving humanitarian aid, while creating jobs and strengthening local economies here at home. Thanks in part to sustained government investment in organizations like UNICEF, my company has grown revenues, expanded our workforce, and developed new products including Planson’s eMITS kits, which were deployed by the UN for several years to set up mobile IT and communications outposts in global emergencies. Contracts with UNICEF and other agencies support Planson jobs for 25 Mainers plus employees in other states.                                                                                                                                  
For decades, America has flexed its technological strength, setting the global pace in innovation and economic growth. My local business proudly contributes to our country’s success. We have improved the speed and efficiency of humanitarian aid delivery systems in many of the hardest-to-reach places on the planet. We will continue to do so if America maintains its support for foreign aid.  
Americans rightly demand that the federal government spend resources efficiently and effectively. Taxpayers want to ensure that their hard-earned tax dollars are invested in American interests. Investments in foreign aid generate a substantial return for American taxpayers. For example, every dollar invested by USAID drove nearly $5 toward the private sector, according to the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition. Of the top 15 export markets in America,13 were once recipients of U.S. foreign assistance. This means foreign aid helps open new markets for American businesses.  
Last year, humanitarian aid organizations like UNICEF invested $770 million in American businesses across 37 states to procure life-saving medicine, ready-to-use therapeutic food, and humanitarian supplies. This created thousands of jobs right here at home. Without these foreign aid outlays, companies across the country would have lost sales.  
Reducing our nation’s traditionally strong foreign aid investments would diminish America’s economic strength, put American jobs at risk, and harm American businesses like Planson International and communities like New Gloucester. For these reasons, Maine’s members of Congress should reject the Trump administration’s rescissions package and reaffirm its support for small businesses and local economies.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Tuesday.
The Department of Agriculture’s Fair Funding Program assists fairs and livestock shows with operational costs, facility improvements and livestock-related expenses, according to Tuesday’s news release.
“Agriculture isn’t just Arkansas’ largest industry — it’s part of our way of life,” Sanders said in the release. “The Fair Funding Program helps showcase our farmers and ranchers and gets the next generation excited about agriculture — while also being a great way for small town Arkansas to come together and have fun.”
The funding will be distributed among 80 fairs and livestock shows, including the Arkansas State Fair in Little Rock, as well as the Arkansas-Oklahoma Fair in Fort Smith and the Four States Fair in Texarkana.
The largest grant of $84,000 will go to the state fair. The Arkansas-Oklahoma Fair, the Four States Fair and five other fairs and livestock shows will each receive $54,000.
Fairs and livestock shows “provide opportunities for the next generation to participate in the industry that provides the food, fiber, fuel, and shelter that is critical to the daily lives of every Arkansan,” Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward said in the news release.
The Arkansas Legislature set aside a maximum of $1,095,272 for county fairs via the Fair Funding Program for fiscal year 2026, an increase of $136,000 compared to fiscal year 2025 and $515,000 compared to fiscal year 2024, according to the Department of Agriculture’s appropriation bills.
Fair organizers who receive aid from the Fair Funding Program are required by law to keep detailed financial records and submit annual reports on their uses of the money to the agriculture department and to Arkansas Legislative Audit.

On July 8, the district’s Board of Education approved a 10% increase in the local school tax rate after telling the public that there wouldn’t be a tax hike this year.
“The justification provided for this sudden reversal was reportedly the discovery of a major accounting error that has placed the district in unexpected financial
jeopardy,” the lawmakers’ letter points out.
Urgency surrounding the situation directly relates to the large and growing size of Appo and the resources it provides.
If the legislators get their wish, a forensic audit would:

Determine the cause and full extent of the accounting error
Evaluate whether fraud, mismanagement, or negligence contributed to the district’s current financial condition
Assess whether the district has been in compliance with state laws, internal controls, and proper accounting procedures
Identify any systemic issues that could pose ongoing risks to fiscal integrity
An inquiry into reported inequities by New Castle County as they relate to the county’s 2024 tax collection process

The last of the points, relating to inequities, ties back to an April 2025 comment from Karen Felix, a member of the Appoquinimink School Board Finance Committee, where she stated that “there were major inequities in the 2024 taxing process, where some residence/commercial properties were taxed, and others were not.”
Lawmakers are understanding that new businesses and new residents of the district, after July 1, 2024 (this past fiscal year), were not taxed.
“As a result, tax revenue from those entities were not collected,” the letter stated. “An explanation of the county’s oversight is, therefore, also requested.”
Taxpayers, parents, and educators deserve full transparency and accountability from district leadership, the letter asserts.
“This audit would provide critical information to inform future oversight, budgetary planning, and legislative decision-making,” it read.
Statement from Superintendent Matt Burrows and new tax rates
“Dear ASD Families,

As many are aware, at the July 8 School Board Meeting, the School Board voted to raise the operating tax rate by approximately 10%. Given the ongoing discussion throughout the community, we wanted to share this communication to ensure everyone has accurate information.

Each year, the Appoquinimink School Board holds a board workshop in June and votes at its regularly scheduled July School Board meeting on the tax rate (also referred to as the tax warrant) for the following school year. The new tax rate must be shared with New Castle County by the second Thursday in July each year by law.

As a reminder, there are four components to the tax rate:

Operating Tax: general operations
Debt Service Tax: funds new buildings and major renovations
Tuition Tax: funds special education and other programs as allowed by law
Match Tax: offered local match for specific state programs as allowed by law

At the June Board Workshop and July Board Meeting, information was shared regarding our current financial position. As was shared at both meetings, the amount of money we’ve been anticipating in our “carryover balance” (think of this as similar to your personal savings account) is lower than we were projecting for this year.

I want to share more information about the timeline of events. In May, shortly after our first School Board Workshop regarding the tax rate – the then-finance director first shared concerns about forecasted or projected expenditures. In June – after the former finance director resigned, the district brought in subject matter experts. Those experts made the district aware of the full impact of the budgeting errors – including underestimated employee costs. At this point, the district became aware the financial position report was missing one payroll cycle, which greatly impacted the predicted carryover balance. In addition, it was discovered summer school expenses were incorrectly assigned to a federal account rather than a district account. Alone, these two errors meant that the carryover would be $3.2 million less. All told, when the corrections were made, this resulted in an estimated carryover of only $3.1 million, which is less than the projected carryover and the $4.2 million required by the State. This all was discovered just before the June Board Workshop. To be clear, this was a forecasting or projecting issue of total budget expenditures.

As a district, we are currently conducting a thorough examination of our financial situation to take corrective action to ensure this never happens again. This review will be conducted by individuals with school finance experience outside of our district.

We have always prided ourselves on our fiscal stewardship, particularly as a district that brings in far less local tax revenue based on our largely residential community. Appoquinimink also has the lowest taxes, the lowest tax assessment base, the lowest operational cost per student, the lowest administrative headcount, and the lowest teacher pay in New Castle County. Our district has always been incredibly careful with spending. Our district receives less revenue than all other districts in our county, yet we have the third highest number of students. On a per student basis, Appoquinimink is spending thousands of dollars less than other nearby districts.

In addition to the errors identified regarding expenditures, we also know three key components significantly impacted budget projections this year, including:

rising utility costs
increasing special education population
national teacher shortage and associated costs for recruiting and retaining staff

We have identified $2.5 million in spending reduction for the next fiscal year. We are focused on making reductions that will have the least impact on our staff and students, aligned with our core value of always doing what’s best for every student.

The key areas where reductions will be implemented are:

Department budgets
School building budgets
Staff reassignments
Program/initiative/position reductions

Moving forward, we are committed to a number of processes to ensure this never happens again, including:

onboarding a new finance director
adding additional members with school finance experience to the oversight committee and providing ongoing training
additional financial reporting that will be shared with the oversight committee and School Board

We are also committed to providing ongoing, detailed information to our community as these measures take place.

After much discussion, a combination of cuts and a one-time rate increase was the path chosen by the School Board. Understandably, some community members do not agree with this decision; however, even after this one-time increase, the district’s operational tax rate will remain lower than all other nearby districts, and Appoquinimink will continue to spend less money per student than its peers. This one-time increase is allowable by law only during reassessment. Please know, this measure was used as a last resort to avoid cuts that would greatly impact our students and staff.

Below are the current new tax rates for our district, broken down by category:

Operating Tax: $0.3541
Debt Service Tax: $0.0750
Tuition Tax: $0.1743
Match Tax: $0.0341
Total per $100 assessed value: $0.6375

School Board Meetings in our district take place the second Tuesday of each month. We diligently share meeting reminders on our website, social media, and newsletters. All families and community members are welcome to attend in-person or watch the livestream on our Appoquinimink YouTube channel. In addition to the regularly scheduled School Board Meetings, School Board Workshops also take place periodically throughout the year. These meetings are also shared on our website, social media, and newsletters. Finally, all of our School Board members are available by email to discuss matters between meetings.

Please know that we are committed to our path forward. As a district, we continue to focus on cost reduction measures and will continue to conduct a thorough examination regarding the situation.

Respectfully,

Matt Burrows”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Shakeup is roiling the race for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District as a Democrat enters the field and a Republican drops out of the special election.
Democratic state Rep. Vincent Dixie of Nashville announced Tuesday he is running for the seat being vacated by Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green of Ashland City, while Republican state Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin said he decided not to enter the race despite filing paperwork with the Federal Election Commission.
A year after reneging on a decision to step down, Green announced he would leave Congress after voting for President Donald Trump’s spending plan, which narrowly passed with permanent tax cuts for the wealthy and increased spending for border patrol amid reductions for Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy programs.
Dixie accused Green of leaving Congress after voting in favor of Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which he said will “devastate communities.”
“I’m not running from the fight — I’m running to it. Because no one is looking out for the folks who cook our meals, teach our kids, and care for our loved ones. And that has to change,” Dixie said in a statement.
Dixie was the first Black lawmaker to chair the House Democratic Caucus and sparred frequently with Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton. He passed legislation to give minority students a better chance to take advanced classes in public schools.
Other Democrats seeking the post are state Rep. Bo Mitchell of Nashville and state Rep. Aftyn Behn, who lives just outside the 7th District in East Nashville. Election law only requires a candidate to live in the state in which they plan to run, not the congressional district. 
The district encompasses parts of northern Nashville, Clarksville, and half of Williamson County, as well as about a dozen other Middle Tennessee counties.

Reedy was prepared to enter the race three weeks ago but backed out after exploring his options.
“In the name of conservative leadership, we have much work to finish. I look forward to continuing to serve the people of District 74,” Reedy said in a statement in which he touted the state legislature’s banning of sanctuary cities and repeal of the Hall income tax on investment earnings.
Republicans seeking the post are former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps, state Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson, state Rep. Lee Reeves of Franklin, Montgomery County Commissioner Jason Knight of Clarksville and U.S. Army veteran Jonathan Thorp of Clarksville. Mason Foley, who works for Main Street Health, also filed candidate paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. 
Stewart Parks, who served time in federal prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riot — and was pardoned by President Donald Trump  — announced his candidacy at a Benton County Republican Party event last week. 
Gov. Bill Lee set Oct. 7 as the date for the primary election and Dec. 2 for the general election.

The South Dakota Republican is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity.
The money is in the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual bill that outlines U.S. military funding priorities. The act passed the committee last week.

Ellsworth Air Force Base in Box Elder has been building up in anticipation of the new bomber program. The base will host the first two squadrons of the next-generation bomber, one a training squad and another an operational one. A third squadron would be placed at the base later on.
Rounds did not have a timeline for the delivery of the bombers, but said the inclusion of $3.5 billion in funding for the bomber program in this year’s bill gets it closer to operational.
The B-21 project began in 2015. The planes are meant to replace the B-1 bombers now housed at Ellsworth. Those planes will age out in the next 10-25 years, as B-21s come online.
Rounds said he’s unsure how much the B-21 program will cost in total by the time the planes are placed. He said the government has ordered 100 planes and could end up ordering 200. The price is about $700 million per plane, according to the Air Force.
In construction at Ellsworth alone, Rounds said the federal government is “looking at well over a billion dollars just in terms of the facilities.”
“That doesn’t include the additional infrastructure around the base itself that we’re going to need, the new schools and so forth,” Rounds said.
The authorization bill includes $378 million for construction at Ellsworth.
Rounds also talked up a $28 million allocation for a Watertown National Guard maintenance building and a 3.8% salary increase for military personnel, among other provisions.
The authorization act is the first step toward getting the federal money moving. Congress would need to appropriate the funds in a separate vote, which Rounds said he hopes to see happen sometime this year.
The B-21 Raider program has spurred rapid growth in Box Elder. This year, Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill to authorize a $15 million, no interest loan to the community’s Douglas School District to help build space for new students.

(Photo courtesy Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)On Tuesday outside city hall, Petersburg officials said yet another night of intense, dangerous rainfall led to major flooding for the third time in a week in the city. While providing updates on the safety concerns and the additional storms rolling in, city leaders explained how the Appomattox River is playing a role in the ongoing overflows. Meanwhile, legislators are touting state-level solutions to manage the recurrent flooding. 
“We had Saturday and Sunday, probably what I would venture to say would be 100 year storms, both days leading into last night,” said Petersburg City Manager John “March” Altman. “Last night, we probably received … probably about 10 inches of rain last night. So this is overwhelming the system.”
The National Weather Service reported that the city has received nearly 8 inches of rain since Saturday morning. On Monday night, rain inundated the region and triggered multiple flash flooding warnings. WRIC reported that some Central Virginia residents had over a foot of water in their backyards and some emergencies required water rescues.
Petersburg Mayor Samuel Parham placed blame not only on the heavy rains, but also on aged water systems that can’t keep up with demand, and lack of dredging in the Appomattox River that allows water to pool in portions of the city. 
The silt filling the river has been an issue for decades. The last time the river was partially dredged was in the 1990s, but the process had to stop partway through near Petersburg once contaminates were found. 
“What we are seeing now are definitely the horrific effects of the many decades of neglect of Petersburg not being able to get the necessary funding to dredge the Appomattox River to prevent a lot of this flooding that you’ve seen pictures of down on Bank in Bollingbrook Street,” Parham said.
Parham said the silt buildup in the harbor area forces water to rush in from the surrounding creeks during these rain events, preventing them from flowing out into the river as they should. There is less movement in the river in these silty spots that makes more parts of town prone to flooding, the mayor suggested.
“So regardless of what we do internally until we can get that water to flow out of that into the Appomattox, it’s going to be a continuous problem here,” Parham said. “So we’re looking at bringing on some public and private partners to hopefully work with the (Army Corps of Engineers) in order to get some funding there to get this dredging done.”
Altman said between the dredging and the water drainage needs, it could take 10-20 years to fully catch up on projects, if they had all the money and resources readily available. There has not been a line in the state budget directly dealing with dredging the river in over 20 years, when an amendment failed to make it into the final draft in 2005.
However, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation this month awarded the city of Petersburg over $2 million to study sediment dredging impacts on the harbor. The city is working to engage the Army Corp of Engineers to finish the 1990s dredging project that left off the critical portions of the river that could help stem the flooding in Petersburg.
“More recently, DCR has invested an additional $4 million to remove silt and replace infrastructure around the stream gates – work that is essential to improving water flow from the Petersburg Harbor into the Appomattox River, thus mitigating flood risk,” said state Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, in a statement.
City officials reiterated Tuesday that removing some of the harbor silt will help, but the major Army Corps of Engineers project needs to be finished to see even more significant flood mitigation.
“It is decades worth of projects that have built up over time, and now we’re in a position where we need to address those, and we’re going to move forward with a positive plan to address those coming into the future,” Altman said.
The city has declared a state of emergency as more rain is anticipated Tuesday afternoon.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

In June 2021, a deadly heat wave pushed temperatures to 109 degrees in Spokane, Washington, a northern city near the Idaho border, where many homes weren’t built with central air conditioning.
As the heat lingered for over a week, 19 people died in Spokane County and about 300 visited hospitals with signs of heat-related illnesses.
Scientists say it’s not a matter of if, but when, another deadly heat wave descends on the region. To help save lives, the city teamed up with my university, Gonzaga, to start preparing for a hotter future.

  A chart of all deaths, excluding COVID-19, shows the extraordinary impact the 2021 heat dome had in Washington. (‘In the Hot Seat’ report, 2022)
We were excited and relieved when the community was awarded a $19.9 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to help it take concrete steps to adapt to climate change and boost the local economy in the process. The grant would help establish resilience hubs with microgrids and help residents without air conditioning install energy-efficient cooling systems. The city doesn’t have the means to make these improvements on its own, even if they would save lives and money in the long run.
Less than a year later, the Trump administration abruptly terminated the funding.
Spokane’s grant wasn’t the only one eliminated – about 350 similar grants that had been awarded to help communities across the country manage climate changes, from extreme heat and wildfire smoke to rising seas and flooding, were also terminated on the grounds that they don’t meet the White House’s priorities. Many other grants to help communities have also been terminated.
Many of the communities that lost funding are like Spokane: They can’t afford to do this kind of work on their own.
 Why cities like Spokane need the help

Like many communities in the American West, Spokane was founded in the late 19th century on wealth from railroads and resource extraction, especially gold, silver and timber.
Today, it is a city of 230,000 in a metro area of a half-million people, the largest on the I-90 corridor between Minneapolis and Seattle. In many ways, Spokane could be on the cusp of a renaissance.
In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a $48 million grant to develop a tech hub that could put the Inland Northwest on a path to become a global leader in advanced aerospace materials. But then, in May, the Trump administration rescinded that grant as well.
The lost grants left the economy – and Spokane’s ability to adapt fast enough to keep up with climate changes – uncertain.

This is not a wealthy area. The median household income is nearly $30,000 less than the state average. More than 13 out of every 100 people in Spokane live in poverty, above the national average, and over 67% of the children are eligible for free or reduced lunch.
The city is a light blue island in a dark red sea, politically speaking, with a moderate mayor. Its congressional district has voted Republican by wide margins since 1995, the year that then-House Speaker Tom Foley lost his reelection bid.
 Lessons from the 2021 heat dome

The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community. The newly formed Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water and the Environment brought together a coalition of government and community partners to apply for the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant Program. The grants, funded by Congress under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, were intended to help communities most affected by pollution and climate change build adaptive capacity and boost the safety of their residents.
A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well. People just weren’t showing up. Our research found that the best approach is to strengthen existing community facilities that people already turn to in moments of difficulty.
Half the $19.9 million award was for outfitting five resilience hubs in existing libraries and community centers with solar arrays and battery backup microgrids, allowing them to continue providing a safe, cool space during a heat wave if the power shuts down.

Another $8 million in grant funding was meant to provide 300 low- to moderate-income homeowners with new high-efficiency electric heat pump heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, providing more affordable utility bills while improving their ability to cool their homes and reducing fossil fuel emissions.
 Communities are left with few options

Now, this and other work is at risk in Spokane and cities and towns like it around the country that also lost funding.
According to the Trump administration, the program – designed to help hundreds of communities around the country become safer – was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
A class action lawsuit was recently filed over the termination of the grants by a coalition that includes Earth Justice and the Southern Environmental Law Center. If the case is successful, Spokane could see its funding restored.
Meanwhile, the city and my team know we have to move fast, with whatever money and other resources we can find, to help Spokane prepare for worsening heat. We formed the Spokane Community Resilience Collaborative – a partnership between community organizations, health officials and the city – as one way to advance planning for and responding to climate hazards such as extreme heat and wildfire smoke.
As concentrations of heat-trapping gasses accumulate in the atmosphere, both the frequency and severity of heat waves increase. It is only a matter of time before another deadly heat dome arrives.

Phil Murphy visited flood-damaged Berkeley Heights on July 15, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the governor’s office)Gov. Phil Murphy said his office has communicated with White House officials about the flash flooding New Jersey experienced on Monday, floods that led to the deaths of at least two people and caused extensive damage in the region.
“Last night we got crushed,” Murphy told reporters while visiting Berkeley Heights. “The White House has been in touch this morning, which is a good sign.”
The governor said state and local officials will assess the damage and then decide whether to seek federal aid.
The storm brought 6 inches of rain in just two and a half hours, flooding numerous roadways including the New Jersey Turnpike, and forcing parts of Routes 22 and 28 to close.
Two people in Plainfield died after they were trapped inside a vehicle as it was swept away in floodwaters. Those deaths follow two deaths in Plainfield during a storm on July 3, according to the city’s mayor, Adrian O. Mapp.
“All of Plainfield grieves this latest loss,” Mapp said in a statement Tuesday. “To lose four residents in such a short span of time is unimaginable. We mourn with the families, and we remain committed to doing all we can to strengthen our emergency response systems and protect residents from future harms.”  
The governor described the flooding as part of a pattern of increasingly intense and frequent storms, worsened by climate change.
“That’s the new reality, and we’re getting dragged by this,” Murphy said. “Mother Nature calls the shots here at the moment.”
The storm came the same day the Murphy administration announced it may loosen proposed flood regulations that have drawn criticism from business groups and some Jersey Shore officials. The rules would mandate, among other things, that new and some improved construction be elevated four feet.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
Elon Musk fumes tax and spending bill is a ‘disgusting abomination’; GOP senators shrug

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
In Missouri, five political parties — Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, Green and Better — ran candidates in the 2024 general election. The Libertarian and Green parties received at least 2% of the vote in one or more statewide races, the threshold for being on future ballots. A new party can be formed in Missouri with 10,000 signatures from registered voters.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Hendricks for CalMatters)An effort is being co-led by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to urge passage of legislation that seeks to generally prohibit federal immigration agents from wearing masks to conceal their identity and requiring them to show their identification and agency-identifying insignia.
The coalition of 21 attorneys general sent a letter Tuesday to members of Congress, expressing concern over escalating incidents involving masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dressed in plainclothes and driving unmarked vehicles detaining people on streets and at homes, workplaces, and courthouses.
“We have watched these detentions with alarm, as the imagery evokes comparisons to repressive tactics that have no place in a free country,” the letter says. “ICE officers’ now routine practice of carrying out arrests in public spaces through masked agents who do not identify themselves as law enforcement has the effect of terrorizing communities rather than protecting them.”

The legislation the coalition is supporting includes the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement, or VISIBLE, Act of 2025, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin.

In a video, Nessel addressed the dangers of immigration enforcement being conducted by agents without identification.
“We’ve already seen cases where bad actors are simulating this behavior to apprehend whomever they want and it’s only a matter of time before an officer is seriously hurt by a good guy attempting to stop what appears to be a kidnapping right before their own eyes,” Nessel said.

In a press release, Nessel also noted that the current ICE tactics contradict Michigan’s resisting and obstructing statute, in which a person is only guilty of those crimes if they knew, or had reason to know, that the individual issuing a command was a police officer. Similarly, officers executing home search warrants are typically required to announce their presence to prevent unnecessary escalation and ensure the safety of both citizens and law enforcement.
While the coalition acknowledged that there may be certain limited instances in which it might be appropriate for federal agents to conceal their identities, they warn in the letter that “widespread, unchecked use of masks and plainclothes enforcement undermines democratic principles, erodes public trust, and invites civil rights abuses.”
Joining Attorney General Nessel in signing the letter were the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature's Appropriations Committee. May 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska ended fiscal year 2024-25 about $86 million below its expected tax revenues, further cementing the budget challenges state lawmakers will face next session. 
On Tuesday, Nebraska’s Department of Revenue released the state’s June tax receipts, revealing net receipts for the month were down about 0.5% from what the state’s forecasting board predicted in April. That drop equates to about $4 million in less revenue headed into Nebraska’s general fund. 
June was the last month of the fiscal year, which spanned from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. Overall, Nebraska’s net receipts for the year were 1.4% down from the forecast, equating to a $86 million drop in expected revenues. 
Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said the receipts mean Nebraska is effectively back in a budget deficit, though the exact number has yet to be determined. 
Budget implications
Lawmakers grappled all session with a projected deficit that fluctuated, growing as high as $432 million. Senators, until the latest update, landed with a budget plan that would have ended the current biennium with a $4 million surplus.
Senators drafted the budget based on projections from the forecasting board’s latest meeting in late April. Following that meeting, Nebraska’s May tax receipts came in more than 14% below their projections, equating to $82 million in less revenue going to the state.

That, combined with the June receipts, led to the $86 million drop. 
While these receipts put Nebraska’s budget balance back in the red, Patent said it isn’t so simple as subtracting $86 million from the $4 million surplus. 
Patent said she would have an update on Nebraska’s financial status at the state’s Tax Rate Review Committee meeting next week.

Biggest factors
The biggest contributors to June’s lower-than-expected receipts were individual and corporate income tax revenues coming in below forecasts, continuing a trend from May. Individual income tax collections were about $30.3 million short, or 11.7% below projections. Corporate income tax collections were $9.6 million short — 6.7% below projections. 
Both Patent and Appropriations Committee Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood said the lower individual income tax revenues are likely due to Nebraska’s pass-through entity tax law (PTET). PTET impacts taxes for pass-through entities like S Corps and some LLCs. 
However, it does not impact Nebraska’s tax liability, nor the state’s net general fund receipts, according to the Department of Revenue. It only changes the timeline of when the state is paid, basically which fiscal years see the revenue. 
Multiple other factors could have contributed to Nebraska’s corporate income taxes coming in below forecast, Patent said. Corporate taxes are affected by each corporation’s expected profits and other tax benefits, she said. 
Both Patent and Clements said Nebraska’s phased decreases to its individual and corporate income tax rates also could have contributed to lower revenues, though they noted that the forecasting board accounted for the decreased rates in the group’s revenue projections. 
One category of revenue that increased was miscellaneous taxes, which Patent said includes a number of sources, including the state’s alcohol and cigarette tax. Miscellaneous tax revenue came in $33.3 million higher than expected in June, a 51.3% increase from the latest forecast. 
While miscellaneous taxes have remained relatively stable, Patent said the increase is likely explained in a different way. The transfers lawmakers approved this session from various cash funds to bolster the budget were included in the category, because those dollars added to the state’s general fund, she said. 
What’s next
Compared to May’s receipts, Clements said June’s receipts being comparatively on par with the forecast was “an improvement.”

In his closing remarks of the session, Speaker of the Legislature John Arch of La Vista warned lawmakers that their biggest challenge in 2026 would likely be balancing the budget. The top concern prompting that warning was uncertainty about possible budget cuts from the federal level. 
Since then, passage of the federal budget reconciliation bill has prompted some concerns over whether Gov. Jim Pillen might call a special session to adjust Nebraska’s budget. 
So far, Clements said he hasn’t heard of any federal changes significant enough to warrant a special session, nor has he heard any talk of the governor calling one. The Governor’s Office had no immediate comment Tuesday on whether Pillen might be considering a special session. 
Even factoring in the latest tax receipts, Clements anticipates no need to make new budget adjustments ahead of the next regular session. 
“There’s no cause for alarm at this point,” Clements said.

(Photo courtesy of Utah County Health Department)A mosquito pool in the Lake Shore-North Palmyra area tested positive for West Nile virus, the first in Utah County this season, the county’s health department confirmed on Tuesday. 
The positive mosquito pool was collected during a routine mosquito surveillance effort, the department said in a release. The area was immediately treated after the test result. 
“Since the initial positive test, the same trap location has been tested twice more, with no additional positive results,” the department said. “Utah County Mosquito Abatement teams continue to monitor the area closely while maintaining regular control efforts countywide.”
While most people who become infected with the virus — most commonly spread by a mosquito bite — don’t develop any symptoms, some may experience headaches, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rashes, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. Fewer than 1% of infected patients develop serious neurologic illnesses, like meningitis. 
Those who think they are infected with the virus should contact their health care providers, the department said.
The Utah County Health Department advises residents to help reduce mosquito breeding and prevent bites by eliminating standing water at home, including in buckets, flower pots, birdbaths, tarps, tires and clogged gutters. Additionally, residents are encouraged to use insect repellent while outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk, and wear long sleeves and pants when possible.

“This is not right,” Uthmeier said during a press conference in Orlando Tuesday. “It still seems insane to me that we’re having this conversation in this country, but we will always fight for what’s right in Florida.”
U.S. Masters Swimming was founded in 1970 and is a national membership nonprofit organization that offers events, swim clubs, and competitions. It released an updated policy regarding transgender participation last month. That change came shortly after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched an investigation over potential violations of Texas law following reports that USMS had allowed a biological male athlete to compete in women’s events in San Antonio in April.
The new policy that went into effect on July 1 now allows USMS members to register for the competition category that aligns with their identity, but for competition purposes athletes will not be included unless they are swimming in the competition category that aligns with their sex assigned at birth. Swimmers who choose to swim in a category that does not align with their sex at birth will no longer be eligible for “Recognition Programs,” but their results will stay in the USMS database.
Uthmeier says that doesn’t cut it.
“They now say that they will reserve, it appears, some competitions for just women but not all, and they have some loopholes where if you go through a transition process you could become eligible again to compete in any one of these competitions,” he said. “This is not acceptable. It does not fly with Florida law. We will use every tool at our disposal from our civil rights laws to our anti-discrimination laws to our consumer protection laws to ensure that we are protecting women and girls.”
Florida laws
Florida’s new Education Commissioner, Anastasios Kamoutsas, said that Florida has become a “beacon of sanity” for women’s sports and women’s spaces, citing legislation in recent years signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis on this issue.
That includes the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act,” a 2021 law specifying that an athletic team or sport designated for females, women, or girls may not be open to students of the male gender, based on the student’s biological sex listed on the student’s official birth certificate at the time of birth. The law applies those requirements to interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sponsored by a public secondary school, high school, college, or university.
There is also the “Safety and Private Spaces Act” signed into law in 2023 providing restrooms and changing facilities for exclusive use by females or males.
Kim Jones, the co-founder of the Independent Council on Women’s Sports (ICONS), said at the news conference that U.S. Masters Swimming continues to allow biological men to compete with women, and said the essential question is whether women and girls deserve access to fair sports — yes or no?
“The state of Florida and AG Uthmeier believes that answer is yes and, unequivocally, so do we.”
The Phoenix reached out to U.S. Masters Swimming but did not receive an immediate response.
The city of San Francisco’s Office of Transgender Initiatives, a local government agency that supports transgender women competing in sports, has said that rather than protecting women’s sports, “bans on trans athletes encourages bullying, discrimination, and even violence against women and girls. These bans can lead to invasive screenings that violate privacy and increase the risk of abuse.”
Public polling
However, public polling consistently shows that most Americans oppose transgendered athletes competing in women’s sports. A Gallup survey released last month reported that 69% of Americans believe that transgender women should only be allowed to play on sports teams that match their birth gender. An NBC News poll conducted of over 19,000 adults in April found that 75% of respondents do not believe transgender athletes should be permitted to participate in women’s sports.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February entitled, “Keeping Men out of Women’s Sports.” And last week his administration sued the California Department of Education for allowing transgender girls to compete on girls’ sports teams, alleging that policy violates federal law.
More than two dozen states have laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions, according to the Associated Press. Some of the policies have been blocked in court.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has joined a growing chorus of voices calling for the return of political contributions from the now-defunct First Liberty Building and Loan, a Newnan-based lending firm with longstanding ties to the Republican Party.
The company has come under fire after federal officials filed a lawsuit accusing First Liberty’s founder, Brant Frost IV, of running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors out of at least $140 million. According to the complaint, Frost misled investors about the nature of his business while funneling over $5 million to himself and his family members. He also improperly used investor funds to make more than $570,000 in political contributions, the complaint alleged, all of which went to Republican candidates and committees.
Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado has received contributions from Frost.

“I take full responsibility for my actions and am resolved to spend the rest of my life trying to repay as much as I can to the many people I misled and let down,” Frost said in a statement issued through his lawyer. “I will be cooperating with the receiver and federal authorities and ask that everyone allow the receiver time to sort things out and do his best to repair the damage I created.”
The allegations have shocked Georgia’s Republican political network, of which the Frost family has long been a part. In 1988, Frost served as Georgia state director for Pat Robertson, a conservative televangelist-turned-Republican presidential candidate. His son, Brant Frost V, worked as a principal at First Liberty and also served as a former vice-chair of the Georgia GOP. His daughter, Katie Frost, chairs a regional committee for the state party. Until last month, both siblings held leadership roles in the Georgia Republican Assembly, a far-right wing of the Georgia Republican Party.
Past recipients of Frost’s political contributions include Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp — who last received a donation from Frost in 2019 — as well as state Sen. Colton Moore and state Rep. Charlice Byrd, according to data from the Georgia State Ethics Commission. Other out-of-state candidates who have received major contributions from Frost include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Boebert.

Raffensperger, whose office is investigating First Liberty alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission, urged recipients to return political contributions they have received from the company or from the Frost family.
“Now is the time for every elected official, candidate, or political action committee who received financial support from this entity currently under investigation to stand up and help the victims,” Raffensperger said. “Ill-gotten gains do not belong in the State Capitol.”
The Democratic Party of Georgia has also urged Republican officials to return the funds.
“We have just learned that numerous Republican elected representatives are funded by money defrauded from unsuspecting Georgians,” said DPG Chair Charlie Bailey. “Now the question is whether Brian Kemp, the Georgia Republican Party, and all the electeds who received this money will do the right thing and return it to the hardworking Georgians from whom it was stolen.”

Senate Enrolled Act 482, which took effect July 1, seeks to improve how schools report student absences to the Indiana Department of Education. 
The law also requires IDOE to publish clearer statewide attendance definitions and guidance for monitoring student participation, as well as a new list of best practices for local districts to employ.
But Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, emphasized Tuesday that the new law does not change how local schools define or enforce their own attendance policies, nor does it expand the state’s authority to penalize families.

A series of highly-circulated social media posts on Facebook, Instagram and X claim the law strips away protections for vulnerable students.
The posts suggest that schools can report students as habitually truant “regardless of circumstance,” and that families affected by homelessness, chronic illness or trauma could be referred to the local prosecutor or child protective services if a child misses at least 10 days of school — excused or unexcused.
Zay said that description isn’t accurate, however.
“There has been a great deal of inaccurate information spread about this bill online in recent weeks,” Zay said in an email to his constituents.
“It is important to know local school districts are retaining their flexibility to decide what counts as an excused or unexcused absence for their students,” he continued. “SEA 482 merely improves the way school administrations report absentee data to the state so policymakers can get a better idea of why students miss school, which is very important since one in five Hoosier students are chronically absent and missing 10% of the school year.”
What the new law does
The law directs schools to more consistently track and report data related to absenteeism so state officials can better understand and respond to the problem.
Under the law, “chronic absenteeism” is now clearly defined as missing at least 10% of instructional days in a school year for any reason, regardless of whether it is excused. That’s equal to about 18 absences per school year.
But local discretion also hasn’t changed. School districts still largely determine where absences fall within three official categories:

Excused absences include illness with a note, funerals, religious observances, college visits, court appearances, and other reasons permitted by district policy. Schools set their own specific policies but must document these absences with appropriate verification, per IDOE guidelines.
Unexcused absences include skipping school, family vacations not approved in advance, or failing to provide documentation for otherwise excusable reasons. These absences count toward truancy thresholds and may trigger attendance interventions.
Exempt absences are those required or protected by state or federal law and do not count against a student’s attendance record. These include jury duty, election service, military obligations, foster care court proceedings, or serving as a legislative page. House Enrolled Act 1660, passed during the 2025 session, further excuses student absences for participation in educational events organized by Future Farmers of America or 4-H.

If a student is expected to miss at least 20 instructional days in a school year due to a medical condition or injury, Indiana law additionally requires the school to provide instruction — but only if a parent submits documentation from a licensed healthcare provider. Schools use that information to develop an educational plan for the student. 
If a student has a documented disability, the team responsible for Individualized Education Programs – IEPs — determines how services should be provided during absences.
IDOE recommends tracking all students’ attendance monthly, with intervention triggers at five total absences, excused or unexcused. Suggested supports include attendance contracts, staff mentoring, family outreach, and referrals for addressing barriers like transportation or health care.
More ‘interventions’ with parents encouraged
The new law allows local prosecuting attorneys to hold “intervention meetings” with parents to help improve a student’s attendance before any legal action is taken, but they’re not required to do so.
Zay clarified, though, that the law does not require a parent meeting for students with excused absences, and county prosecutors are not notified about a student’s absence if they are excused.
Indiana schools get roadmap for K-12 policy changes following 2025 legislative session

That’s different from cases of “habitual truancy,” which was already defined in Indiana law as 10 or more days without an excuse. 
State statute requires superintendents or attendance officers to report a student who is habitually absent from school to the local prosecuting attorney. Prosecuting attorneys must then notify parents if an affidavit of habitual truancy is filed with their office.
Until July 1, 2026, K-8 students also can’t be expelled “solely because the student is chronically absent or habitually truant.” After that date, however, students could be removed from school once again if they miss too many days of class.
Hoosier education officials have flagged chronic absenteeism as a growing, statewide concern in recent years — and especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Roughly one in five Indiana students — roughly 219,00 kids — were chronically absent during the 2023-24 school year, with higher rates among students of color, students with disabilities, and those from low-income families, according to the most recent IDOE data. 
New statistics for the 2024-25 academy year are expected to be released this fall, along with additional IDOE guidance for schools to prevent chronic absenteeism and promote attendance.

The legislation would limit collection and distribution of data concerning reproductive and transgender care, including by prohibiting technology service providers and state regulators from fulfilling federal and out-of-state requests for relevant documents.
The post House ready to instill protections against reproductive rights ‘incursions’ appeared first[...]","THE HOUSE is poised to pass legislation Wednesday that would update the 2022 law shielding reproductive and transgender care in Massachusetts from legal threats that one top Democrat described as a “game of whack-a-mole.”
House Speaker Ron Mariano and two deputies said Tuesday they will bring to the floor a redraft (H 4271) of a Senate-approved bill that implements additional protections for providers and patients including a ban on dissemination of personally identifiable data linked to abortions or other reproductive or gender-affirming care.
Lawmakers pitched the measure as a way to plug gaps in existing state law, warning that the Trump administration and Republicans in other states could target Massachusetts in a post-Roe v. Wade crackdown.
“We thought what we did for [the law] back in 2022 addressed a pressing issue that we were seeing coming down the pipe,” Rep. Michael Day, who co-chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview. “Unfortunately, it seems like this is going to be a game of whack-a-mole with an administration and states that continue to try to get involved in health decisions that individuals are making.”
The legislation would limit collection and distribution of data concerning reproductive and transgender care, including by prohibiting technology service providers and state regulators from fulfilling federal and out-of-state requests for relevant documents, according to a House summary.
Pharmacies could list a practice’s name, instead of an individual physician’s name, on prescription medication labels for reproductive and transgender drugs. Providers, attorneys and non-profit entities would also gain new protections from licensure or insurance consequences for their work in those fields.
The bill additionally seeks to codify a requirement at the state level for hospitals to treat all patients facing emergencies, including when abortion is medically necessary. Some lawmakers and advocates worry the federal version of that law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), could be threatened by the Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress.
Day described the suite of reforms as “making sure that we’re really buttoning things up.”
Asked if he was aware of any instances of care being targeted in Massachusetts already, he pointed to the US Justice Department’s move last week to subpoena 20 unidentified doctors and clinics for information about “transgender medical procedures on children.”
“It’s only a matter of time before it gets to us if it hasn’t already,” Day said. “I don’t have a specific instance of one of those subpoenas landing in Massachusetts, but there’s nothing precluding that right now.”
“There’s definitely little pieces of incursions coming up, but again, in Mass., we don’t wait for Armageddon,” he added. “We see this coming. They broadcast what their intent is, and so we act first to make sure that doesn’t become a reality here.”
The House Ways and Means Committee voted to recommend the bill Tuesday, setting the stage for a vote of the full House on Wednesday. 
Twenty-one House Democrats on the panel voted in favor of advancing the bill, according to results provided by a committee official. All eight of the panel’s Republicans reserved their rights, meaning they opted against standing for or against the bill during the committee poll.
The poll results did not list any vote taken by Democrat Reps. Rodney Elliott of Lowell, Russell Holmes of Boston, Kristin Kassner of Hamilton, Patrick Kearney of Scituate, Rita Mendes of Brockton, Alan Silvia of Fall River, and Chynah Tyler of Boston.
Democrats hold supermajority margins in both chambers, and they outnumber Republicans 133-25 in the House. Rep. Susannah Whipps of Athol is registered as an independent and Democrat Representative-elect Lisa Field plans to join the House on Wednesday and get its membership back up to 160.
Day said the House redraft is “pretty close” to the version (S 2543) the Senate approved 37-3 — with two Republicans in support and three opposed — on June 26.
House Minority Leader Brad Jones previously said he “appreciate[s] the concerns that have been raised” about patients and providers facing prosecution and tracking for care offered in Massachusetts.
“I start out with sort of a predisposition to say, if you’re in Massachusetts availing yourselves of what are our laws, you shouldn’t face penalty or prosecution in your home state — and if you do, we shouldn’t be a party to it,” Jones, the chamber’s top Republican, said on July 1.
Mariano, who last month signaled an interest in acting quickly on the measure, on Tuesday said the House vote will occur “as the Trump Administration and Republicans across the country continue to target individuals for exercising their right to make their own health care decisions in consultation with their doctor.”
“The Shield Act builds on the Commonwealth’s proud history of preserving and expanding access to reproductive and gender-affirming care by establishing new safeguards around patient data, and by protecting health care professionals who provide that vital care,” Mariano said in a joint statement alongside Day and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz. “Above all else, this legislation is representative of the House’s commitment to ensuring that Massachusetts remains a place where our residents can make personal health care decisions without fear of prosecution.”

Free.,"More 'Alligator Alcatraz' centers to be built by states flush with cash, experts predict",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/more-alligator-alcatraz-centers-be-built-states-flush-cash-experts-predict,,"WASHINGTON — Former top immigration officials from the Biden administration warned Tuesday that billions for immigration enforcement signed into law earlier this month will escalate the rapid detention and deportations of immigrants.During a virtual press conference with the immigration advocacy group America's Voice, the former Department of Homeland Security officials said they expect to see a trend toward states building ""soft"" temporary detention centers similar to Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz,” the name given by Florida Republicans to an Everglades detention center.Funding for those initiatives will come from President Donald Trump's tax break and spending cut bill signed into law earlier this month that provides roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement, the former officials said.Trump's massive tax and spending cut bill provides $30 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, making it the nation’s highest-funded law enforcement agency, to hire 10,000 new agents and carry out deportations. Another $45 billion will go to ICE for the detention of immigrants and $450 million in grants to states to partake in border enforcement.Billions more are provided for border security and for the military to partake in border-related enforcement.Andrea Flores, who directed border management for the National Security Council under former President Joe Biden said she expects to see states running their own immigration detention centers similar to the “Alligator Alcatraz” center that state officials quickly erected to hold immigrants. That state-run facility in the Florida Everglades is expected to house up to 5,000 immigrants.Safety for migrants questionedJason Houser, who served as ICE chief of staff in the Biden administration, said the quickly built detention centers will likely create an unsafe environment for immigrants brought there. The lack of experience and training for employees running those centers will also put migrants at risk, he said.""People are gonna get hurt,"" he said. ""They’re gonna die.""He added that with the arrest quotas that immigration officials have been given, roughly 3,000 arrests a day, ""ICE is going to focus on those (immigrants) that are easily reachable, those who have been complying and checking in,"" either with immigration officials or appearing in immigration court.""Hitting quotas is not in the national security interest,"" Houser said.Houser said with the rapid arrest and detention of immigrants, the need for detention centers will likely lead to states building the ""soft sided"" detention centers in ""some of the most rural parts of the country where they cannot be properly staffed and resourced.""Flores said if states work to build their own centers like the one in Florida, there will likely be a lack of oversight because DHS has significantly fired federal employees that ran the watchdog that conducted oversight of ICE — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.Flores currently serves as the vice president of immigration policy at FWD.us, which focuses on immigration policy and reform.Increase expected in third-country removalsRoyce Murray, a former DHS assistant secretary for border and immigration policy and a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official during the Biden administration, said she is concerned that the Trump administration will now be able to ramp up third-country removals with the increase in funding.Any removals  to a third country “have to be to a country that is safe,"" she said.If an immigrant has a final order of removal but their home country will not accept their deportation, then the United States typically looks for another country that will accept the removal — a third country.The Trump administration has tried to secure agreements with countries to take deportees, such as Mexico and South Sudan, which recently ended a civil war, but is still experiencing violence. The State Department warns against travel to South Sudan, but the Trump administration won a case before the Supreme Court seeking to use the East African country for third-country removals.Murray said that the Trump administration is using third-country removals to ""create a climate of fear"" and get immigrants to self-deport.She said if third-country removals are going to take place, they ""need to be a place where people can successfully integrate.""",,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

Ron DeSantis on Tuesday marked a major milestone in state’s Everglades restoration efforts — completion of a reservoir designed to hold billions of gallons of water with the goal of preventing recurrences of the toxic algae blooms that have befouled rivers in Florida.
The event, however, came as his administration continues to get hammered by environmentalists for its immigration detention center in the Everglades, which has triggered an ever-widening legal battle over “Alligator Alcatraz.”
The Caloosahatchee River reservoir, dubbed C43, can hold approximately 55 billion gallons of water with a maximum depth ranging from 15 feet to 25 feet. The reservoir captures and stores offloads from Lake Okeechobee if the water gets too high during the wet season and will provide essential water flows to the river during the dry season. The idea is to improve the health of the river and its estuary. 
The four large pumps can move more than 650,000 gallons of water per minute from the Caloosahatchee River into the reservoir.
“We understand that the Everglades is home to a lot of great species, that it provides fresh water to Florida Bay, as well as clean drinking water for more than 8 million Floridians, and it supplies irrigation for the state’s agriculture. So this was something that had been neglected for too long. We needed to take the bull by the horns, and we needed to get it done,” DeSantis said during a press conference at the site.
The event came just days after the administration opened a quickly built detention center deep in the heart of the Everglades at the site of a training airport. Democrats have decried conditions at the center and environmentalists warn the facility — which at last count held nearly a 1,000 detainees — threatens harm to the “River of Grass.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lawsuit
Several groups filed a federal lawsuit and, late Monday evening, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida asked to intervene in the case. The tribe is concerned about the potential for harm to the Everglades, noting that there are 10 tribal villages located within a three-mile radius of the site. 
The court filing argues that tribal members have routinely used land at and near the center for hunting and fishing as well as traditional ceremonies. They also fear a security risk.
The court filing insists environmental studies are needed to understand the potential harm from the center, which eventually could hold as many as 3,000 detainees.
DeSantis, however, has contended that the center — toured by President Donald Trump earlier this month — will have “zero” environmental impact and will not undo the ongoing efforts to restore the Everglades.
The governor mentioned the billions of dollars Florida has spent since he became governor to help the Everglades and prevent pollution.

Blooms of toxin-producing algae caused a death of wildlife and wreaked economic damage on the coastal communities that rely on the water for their economic activity. The glow of the blue-green algae made national headlines in 2018 and helped inform the gubernatorial debate that year. While on the stump, then-candidate DeSantis vowed to clean up the environmental mess and immediately issued an  executive order after taking office in 2019 that included expediting the C43 reservoir.
He also appointed a task force to recommend solutions but never acted on its report.
Delays
The project was completed by the South Florida Water Management District after years of  questions and delays including the state firing its contactor. Environmental groups questioned the project because it lacked a water quality treatment facet and said algae could grow in the reservoir.
DeSantis was joined at the press conference by Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Alexis Lambert and Senate President Ben Albritton, who praised the governor for his work on expediting the dam.
“We are one step closer to being able to provide the protection for our coastal communities, making sure that our fisheries remain healthy and bountiful for those that make their living in and around the water in these communities, and it is meaningful for the future of Florida,” Albritton said, adding that the Senate “will be heavily and heartily fighting for Everglades restoration.”

On June 30, the Santa Fe National Forest announced that lightning caused the 176-acre fire and that they were going to “actively manage” the blaze, hoping to encourage low-intensity fire to spread across a roughly 13,000 mile area. 
Noting that the fire was burning in an area that had undergone a National Environmental Policy Act review, and had previously been subject to prescribed burns and thinning, Santa Fe National Forest Deputy Forest Supervisor Anthony Madrid said the fire presented “an opportunity to create a resilient ecosystem that reduces the future risk of catastrophic severe wildfire to communities.”
Since June 30, the Forest Service provided daily updates and smoke alerts. It also provided updates on where it was igniting managed fires to manage vegetation in front of an actively burning fire front. 
On July 12, the Forest Service announced that a spot fire had ignited outside of containment lines the day prior. Before the spot fire escaped, the fire had reached about 12,000 acres and was 87% contained. 
As of Tuesday, the fire is about 15,000 acres and is 40% contained, according to the Santa Fe National Forest.
As a result of the escape, the Southwest Incident Management Team 1 took over the fire Monday morning, according to a Forest Service spokesperson, and is tasked with fully suppressing the fire. More than 250 firefighters and other personnel have mobilized to fight the blaze.

As homeowners know, a slow water leak is capable of causing more damage than a fast one. A burst pipe demands an immediate fix, but a leaky pipe can drip indefinitely. Perhaps water seeps out undetected, or repairs get put off in favor of more urgent tasks.
The cost of delay, measured in days or weeks, is minimal, but over years, it can be catastrophic. First it shows up in the form of higher water bills. Give it long enough, though, it can undermine the structural integrity of the house. 
Mississippi has been slowly leaking population for a long time. Over the past decade, the state has lost an average of 5,000 residents per year. The primary cause is outmigration to other states, particularly among recent college graduates – a problem known as brain drain. But rising mortality rates and declining birth rates have also taken a toll on the state’s ability to replenish its population, especially since the pandemic. 
In any given year, the losses amount to a small fraction of Mississippi’s nearly three million residents. Spread throughout the state, the changes can be difficult to notice in everyday life. Over time, however, the trickle has caused a flood. 
Since 2010, 80,000 more people have moved out of Mississippi than have moved in. Put together, they would make up the second-largest city in the state. If such a city existed, it would be one of the best-educated places in the country: four-year college graduates account for all of the net outmigration among people ages 22 to 50.

As a state, we need take a close look at the causes and consequences of our population decline. We must focus particular attention on the brain drain of four-year college graduates, which represents the single greatest challenge for the state’s future. It shapes the lives and livelihoods of every Mississippian, no matter whether they went to college or not.
The brain drain levies a hidden tax on people who remain in Mississippi by choice or necessity. The departure of college graduates reduces average income and job openings for all workers, regardless of their level of education. A smaller population – one deprived of many of its top earners – means all residents must pay higher taxes and utility rates to maintain infrastructure and public services. And a significant portion of every dollar invested in public education, the state’s largest budgetary expense, is converted into a subsidy to the states where Mississippi’s graduates end up working.
The brain drain has begun to erode the foundation of the state’s economy and communities, setting off a cascade of challenges that drives even more people to leave.
Existing businesses struggle to retain talented employees who can earn more money elsewhere, and new businesses choose not to invest when the pool of skilled workers is shrinking. Vacant houses and storefronts blight once-vibrant neighborhoods and downtowns, eating away at property values and family savings. Schools and churches that served as community pillars for generations close or consolidate. This is not the case in every part of the state, but it is a story familiar to many Mississippians.
That’s why Working Together Mississippi, a nonprofit organization comprising hundreds of community-based institutions across the state, is relaunching Rethink Mississippi as an initiative to find solutions to the state’s brain drain and population decline.
I started Rethink Mississippi a decade ago as a website featuring policy analysis and commentary written by young Mississippians for young Mississippians. Two things quickly became obvious: first, Mississippians of all backgrounds share a love for their state that is rare in an era of rootlessness and polarization; and second, the question that dominated all others was whether Mississippi could offer young people enough opportunity to keep them in the state. For too many, the answer has been no. 
I believe that the solutions to the brain drain can be found in the enduring attachment that binds Mississippians to their home state. Even if they have moved far away, Mississippi is never far from their minds or their mouths. Therefore, the best way to find out how to keep people in Mississippi – or how to bring them back – is to ask them.
Through a partnership with Mississippi Today and the Center for Population Studies at the University of Mississippi, we have developed a survey to do just that. We invite you to spend a few minutes taking it. Your insight is valuable, no matter where you are from or where you live now.
A leak will not fix itself. The first step is figuring out the solutions, then we have to do the work. It might be difficult, but it is necessary. We are too invested in our home to let it wash away.

(Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)The Trump administration must allow refugees to enter the United States from countries covered by the president’s travel ban, a federal judge in Seattle ruled Monday.
U.S. District Court Judge Jamal Whitehead’s decision opens the door for around 80 refugees to immediately arrive from countries whose citizens are banned from traveling here.
Whitehead also ruled the Trump administration needs to potentially allow refugees to enter the United States even if their planned travel was postponed before the president took office.
Affected individuals and resettlement organizations, including Lutheran Community Services Northwest in Tacoma, brought the lawsuit after President Donald Trump halted refugee admissions via executive order on his first day in office.
In February, Whitehead, a Biden appointee, ruled the president’s order likely “crossed the line” of separation of powers.
But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later narrowed Whitehead’s ruling to only allow the entry of refugees whose applications were approved before Trump signed the executive order. For refugees to enter the country under the appeals court ruling, they also needed clearance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and travel plans arranged at the time Trump issued his ban on refugee admissions.
That decision from a three-judge 9th Circuit panel didn’t stop Trump from otherwise halting the United States Refugee Admissions Program.
Whitehead ordered the federal government to facilitate entry for refugees who met the appeals court’s three-prong test and had travel scheduled within two weeks of Trump’s order. The feds reported 160 people met those criteria.
Magistrate Judge Michelle Peterson, of Seattle, will review the cases of others whose scheduled arrival date was after Feb. 3. This includes more than 4,000 cases comprising upward of 12,000 potential refugees.
The question before the district court was whether the Trump administration still needed to admit refugees from countries targeted in Trump’s early June travel ban. Refugees from these countries make up two-thirds of those who met the appeals court’s criteria but haven’t been admitted to the U.S. yet.
One of the plaintiffs in the litigation is a Bellevue woman who filed an application to sponsor a refugee family from Afghanistan before the federal government suspended their case. Afghanistan is included in the president’s travel ban.
The organizations involved in the case also fear the Trump administration is undercounting the number of impacted refugees. They say the federal government isn’t including people whose travel plans were postponed for reasons other than the refugee ban, like application processing delays. And some plans may have been canceled in anticipation of the president’s actions.
The Trump administration countered in court documents that those refugees aren’t covered by the appeals court’s order. Department of Justice attorney Joseph McCarter called the request a “baseless and unrestrained expansion” of the ruling.
Whitehead ruled refugees whose travel plans were canceled between Dec. 1 and Jan. 20 are also covered by his order, paving a path for more to arrive in the United States.
Within a week from Monday, the federal government must identify all cases meeting the appellate court’s three-part test, Whitehead ordered.
The government must also expedite the entry of unaccompanied refugee children and Afghan refugees temporarily staying at a camp in Qatar.

(Screenshot)Jefferson County has a confirmed case of measles, which is unrelated to the Central Kentucky outbreak, Louisville officials announced Tuesday. 
Kentucky’s 13th case this year is in a child who recently traveled internationally “to a country that is known to have an outbreak of measles,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said during his weekly press conference. 
The Louisville Health Department is in the process of tracing contacts with anyone who may have been exposed to the highly contagious disease and will ask those people to isolate in order to prevent spread. 
It’s unknown if the child was vaccinated against measles, said Connie Mendel, Louisville’s chief health strategist. Eleven of the state’s other 12 cases are in people unvaccinated against measles, Greenberg said, and the 12th is in a person who got only half the recommended vaccine series. 
The increase in prevalence of measles, once thought eliminated, comes amid a nationwide decline in routine vaccination. 
“We acknowledge that there are people in our country that don’t want to get vaccinated,” Greenberg said. “I would encourage every parent to just follow the evidence. Look at the facts, follow the advice — the strong, overwhelming advice — of the medical profession, and I hope that will lead them to the conclusion to get their children vaccinated.”
Measles is extremely contagious and spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old. Mendel said it’s especially important to get the full measles vaccination series as schools prepare to open again for the new school year. 
Mendel said anyone who is symptomatic of measles and seeking medical care should call ahead of time and let the medical facility know so they don’t spread the disease to others. 
“Your medical provider can make special arrangements for you to be seen outside of the general public within a medical facility,” she said. “We would go even further, and the patient would come into a side door — because it is that infectious.”

Silt and debris removal projects will move forward as more rains are expected over the weekend, Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford told Source NM. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Feds partially approve funds for Ruidoso flooding disaster

Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
The feds pull back
Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.













There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has. 


– There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has. – Michael Coen, chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations





Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
Disaster declarations
In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

(Photo courtesy of Maine ALLCare)Members of U.S. Congress re-introduced the State Based Universal Health Care Act, which, if passed, would automatically initiate the establishment of a board to create a publicly funded health care system in Maine due to a 2021 state law. 
“Maine is ready,” said state Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) at a press conference in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, joined by members of Congress and legislators from six other states working on state-based universal health care plans.
Maine’s Public Law 391 calls for the establishment of a universal health care plan for the state through a governor-appointed board, but its effective date is contingent on enactment of a federal law opening the door for such a plan.
The Maine law initially started as a bill detailing a plan for a publicly funded, privately delivered health care system, but it was amended to leave all of the details of such a plan to a Maine Health Care Board.  
The federal legislation would create a waiver allowing states to develop their own plans to provide universal health care for their residents via access to federal funding streams. All benefits provided under state plans would have to be at least as comprehensive and affordable as the coverage under the equivalent federal program. 
Healthcare for All Maine, the advocacy arm of Maine AllCare, pushed for the state law in 2021 and is a partner in this federal legislation, which is co-sponsored by Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine. However, with Republican control of both chambers, the current Congress is unlikely to pass the measure.
The re-introduction of this federal legislation comes as 31,000 Mainers are expected to lose their health care in the first year under the a tax and spending package signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, according to a report by Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services. Even before passage of Republicans’ spending bill, more than 40% of Maine’s hospitals had already been at risk of closing but cuts to Medicaid are expected to further increase the strain on hospitals, particularly in rural areas.
“In the wake of the disastrous federal budget that threatens our rural hospitals and the health care of our most vulnerable, the enactment of [the federal legislation] would allow Maine to get right to work in creating a health care program for Maine that would cover everyone and save our rural hospitals,” Julie Keller Pease, chair of Maine AllCare and secretary of Healthcare for All Maine, said. 
The federal legislation would require participating states to propose plans to provide this coverage for 95% of residents within five years and, after that, states would be required to show they achieved that goal and then provide a plan to cover the remaining 5% of the population. 
Different from the waiver flexibility currently provided under the Affordable Care Act, this legislation would also allow states to integrate funds from Medicare, the country’s health insurance program for people ages 65 or older and some younger people with disabilities, into their state plan. Multiple states would also be able to apply for joint waivers to create a regional plan.
“Our current health care system is complicated. It’s inefficient,” Talbot Ross said. “It costs too much and it leaves many uninsured and/or unable to get the care that they need.” 
According to the most recent data available from 2020, Maine had the 10th highest per capita health expenditures in this country. Talbot Ross also cited a survey by Consumers for Affordable Health Care released in 2023 that found more than 70% of Mainers believed that one major illness could bankrupt them. 
This year, the Maine Legislature considered two bills, supported by Maine AllCare, focused on state based universal healthcare. Both failed. 
LD 1269 proposed a comprehensive study to analyze the costs and feasibility of a universal health care plan. LD 1883 offered a detailed blueprint for a state-wide system called the All Maine Health Program that would provide comprehensive coverage to all Maine residents.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that West Virginia can restrict access to the abortion pill, dismissing a challenge from drug manufacturer GenBioPro. 
West Virginia lawmakers passed a near-total abortion ban in September 2022, on the heels of Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe V. Wade. 
GenBioPro, which makes a generic form of the abortion drug mifepristone, challenged the abortion ban, arguing that the Federal Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the abortion drug should preempt the state law. 
With a 2-1 decision Tuesday, the judges court upheld an August 2023 ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
“The district court determined there was no preemption, and we now do the same,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote in the 45-page opinion published Tuesday. “For us to once again federalize the issue of abortion without a clear directive from Congress, right on the heels of Dobbs, would leave us one small step short of defiance.
“Appellant GenBioPro finds this clear directive in a maze of provisions in the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. It argues that these provisions vested the FDA with the exclusive authority to regulate access to mifepristone. We disagree,” he wrote. 
In a statement and a post on the social media platform X, Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who defended the abortion ban in his prior role as state attorney general, called the ruling a “big win” and a “pro-life victory.”
“…I am proud to see a victory in this case,” Morrisey said. “West Virginia can continue to enforce our pro-life laws and lead the nation in our efforts to protect life. We will always be a pro-life state!”
GenBioPro produces the majority of the mifepristone sold in the United States. The drug is one of two used in a regimen to end an early pregnancy. The company has held FDA approval for generic mifepristone since 2019, it wrote in a news release. 
The drug manufacturer said Tuesday’s ruling jeopardizes women’s access to FDA-approved medication. 
“The court is allowing the state to continue putting those seeking medication abortion care in harm’s way,” CEO Evan Masingill said in the statement. “The panel’s ruling allows states to restrict access to medications that the FDA has deemed safe and effective, threatening a dangerous ripple effect on the availability of essential medications in this country. 
“As we have always made clear, GenBioPro will not stop fighting to ensure all people can access safe, evidence-based health care,” he said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)A Court of Appeals panel has ruled that one of three Jewish women suing the state has standing — the right — to challenge Kentucky’s abortion ban. 
Chief Judge Larry E. Thompson and judges Susanne M. Cetrulo and Jeff S. Taylor all agreed on Friday: two of the three women — Lisa Sobel and Sarah Baron — don’t have standing, while the third, Jessica Kalb, does. 
This is because Kalb has nine frozen embryos right now that she’s paying to preserve as part of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process and doesn’t know how she can proceed with the process under the state’s restrictions on abortion and definition of life. 
Kalb also canceled having an embryo implanted  in 2022 “due to her uncertainty surrounding Kentucky’s abortion laws,” according to the ruling, shared with the Lantern by the women’s lawyers. 
The case now returns to Jefferson Circuit Court, where Judge Brian Edwards can rule on its merits rather than the issue of standing. Standing is the question of whether plaintiffs’ circumstances meet legal standards entitling them to challenge the law. In 2023, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that abortion providers could not challenge the ban on behalf of their patients. The U.S. Supreme Court, too, has avoided ruling on the merits of abortion bans and instead focused on standing. 
‘Between rock, hard place:’ Will anyone ever have standing to challenge Kentucky’s abortion ban?

One of the lawyers, Benjamin Potash, said the women’s legal team doesn’t agree with the decision that Sobel and Baron don’t have standing, but “we’re happy to move forward with what we’ve got.” 
“I think what we’ve got now is a very solid chance of clearing up this ambiguity in the law and making this law a little bit fairer for everyone involved,” Potash said. 
In a statement shared with the Lantern, Kalb said “I need to call on everyone who stands for religious freedom, women’s rights and those who believe medical decisions should happen in the sacred space between a doctor and their patient to stand with us as we try to explain why these laws are unjust.” 
“I want so badly to grow my family. The current (presidential) administration has claimed to support IVF without understanding how limiting my access to reproductive healthcare is damaging,” Kalb said. “The fact that lawmakers who don’t understand healthcare or my religious beliefs have more rights to my body than I do is sickening.”  
Attorney General Russell Coleman, who is a defendant in the case, said in a statement that “Kentucky law is clear” on this issue. 
“Access to IVF is fully protected for Kentuckians hoping to grow their families,” Coleman said. “We are confident the circuit court will agree once again.”
Is IVF protected in Kentucky? Depends on whom you ask.

‘Not a speculative issue’ 
Kalb previously told reporters that she has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can cause cysts to form in the ovaries and lead to infertility. This condition also means her pregnancies are more likely to end in miscarriage and that she might need an  abortion or other complicated interventions. 
Under the state abortion ban that took effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion, a patient must be at risk of death or the permanent impairment of a vital organ.
Meanwhile, “Ms. Kalb is paying money to keep the embryos frozen,” the appeals court ruling states. “Should she continue to do so in perpetuity because the government will not clarify what she can and can’t do with them? No.” 
She “needs the court to clarify her rights,” the ruling states.  
“This is not a speculative issue because these embryos currently exist, and Ms. Kalb is entitled to know her options without fear of potential legal peril,” the judges wrote. “As to Sobel and Baron, there is no impending threat.”
Sobel said she has mixed feelings about the ruling that she and Baron lack standing to challenge the abortion ban. 
“On the one hand, I am glad that the case is moving forward, and I can understand why they supported Jessica in having standing because she does have frozen embryos currently,” she told the Lantern. “On the flip side, though, it feels like they don’t fully understand how the process of IVF works.” 
Sobel is 41 and wants another child, but attempting to have one is a “gamble,” she said. During her first round of IVF, she got four embryos, none of which were viable, she said. In her second round, she got two embryos. 
“I transferred both of those, and only have one living child,” she said. “Knowing that I create non viable embryos more so than I create viable embryos, I don’t want to start down that financial and emotional burden until I understand what the law truly means for somebody like me.”  
Sobel said the ruling that she doesn’t have standing to continue in the case leaves a “big hole” in her community. She is hoping the remaining defendant’s case can proceed quickly and offer her clarity. 
“We hope that (Edwards) will feel pressure to give us a ruling sooner, because our lives are on hold,” Sobel said. “I’m not getting any younger. I’m 41 now, and through the miracles of science, I can probably have a child up until I’m 50. But … we know that that brings extra complications to it, just because of pure biology.” 
‘Preference to Christian values’

The women have argued that Kentucky, in heavily restricting abortion, has imposed and codified a religious viewpoint that conflicts with the Jewish belief that birth, not conception, is the beginning of life.
In other words, the appeals court said, they allege the state is “giving preference to Christian values to the detriment of their Jewish faith.” 
The attorney general’s legal team argued in court that since Kentucky’s law defines pregnancy as a fetus inside a woman, disposing of embryos created during the IVF process doesn’t fall under abortion purview. 
The women’s lawyers, on the other hand, contend that isn’t clearly defined in the law. 
In the coming months, Potash said, the team will need to clear “procedural hurdles” and eventually hold oral arguments again focused on the merits of the case, not standing. Meanwhile, he’s happy the appeals panel found “very little nuance” in Kalb’s standing. 
“We did not have a liberal panel; we did not have a conservative panel. We had a little bit of everything: we had a woman judge; we had two men judges,” Potash said. “We had liberals, we had conservatives. And what it boiled down to is that they studied the law and they got it right. And you can’t ask for more from judges than that.” 
Even though she doesn’t have standing to continue in the IVF lawsuit, Sobel said she will stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Kalb as the case progresses. 
“The IVF community is waiting,” she said. “The Jewish community is waiting to know how this lawsuit will pan out, and we deserve a ruling.”

Article Summary

Congress’ latest budget package slashed federal tax incentives for solar developments. Industry insiders said the latest federal policies create “a lot of uncertainty.”
Illinois facilitates significant funding for the renewables industry, particularly for solar, which provides some insulation against the federal action.
Still, advocacy groups fear energy prices will rise at a faster rate as the federal changes alter the trajectory of renewable energy production in the U.S.
Industry groups are calling on the state to offer more incentives to renewables, notably battery storage.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans earlier this month curtailed federal tax incentives for the solar energy industry and for individuals and companies that purchase solar panels.

The move sent shockwaves through the industry nationwide, pulling key incentives for major projects and residential rooftop solar alike.

But in Illinois, members of the industry say state policy gives a bit of cover. While they have seen a wave of business before Biden-era tax breaks sunset, solar companies are left with uncertainty in the long-term.

Others fear Trump’s actions will drive up prices by slowing the pace of renewables entering the market as fossil fuels exit for economic reasons.

The spending plan that Trump signed into law on July 4 will end several decades-old tax incentive programs between now and 2027. Those programs, which offer credits for rooftop solar systems and investment in large-scale projects, were expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act, a major initiative of former President Joe Biden.

Trump followed the bill signing with a July 7 executive order aimed at quickly ending any subsidies for “expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar.”

Between the spending bill and the executive order, the federal government will also stop offering a tax credit for the manufacture of wind power components and instead offer a similar subsidy to the coal used in steel production.

The new law also denies incentives to any projects that are owned by certain foreign entities or use a significant amount of supplies from those entities, like the Chinese government and its affiliated businesses.

This is particularly difficult for battery storage and solar projects, which often rely on minerals and components mined in or manufactured in China.

This leaves many consumer advocates and energy experts looking to Illinois to further insulate the industry, which is a key part of how the state plans to replace fossil fuel-generated electricity with carbon-free sources by 2045 as required by state law.

Energy price increase

The bill will likely result in higher energy prices across the country, according to an analysis from the REPEAT Project, a joint research effort by Stanford Professor Jesse Jenkins’ Princeton Lab and Evolved Energy Research.

A separate analysis from think tank Energy Innovation, whose CEO was a senior Biden advisor involved in drafting climate change-related legislation, links the cost increases to a reduction in the number of renewable power plants that will be built under the new law.

This will affect electricity capacity markets directly as well as increase the wholesale price of natural gas due to the power sector’s increased reliance on it. Federal data indicates natural gas is currently used for about 17.3% of all electricity generation in Illinois.

Estimates of the scale of the electric bill cost increase for a typical household vary. REPEAT pegs the increase at $280 per household per year by 2035 nationwide. Energy Innovation’s model suggests $170 annual increase by 2035 and $180 in Illinois.

A spokesperson for the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group in Illinois, echoed the sentiment and said ending the tax credit programs “is a gut punch to consumers and our economy.”

Solar industry ‘uncertainty’

Jon Carson, the managing partner at Trajectory Energy Partners, said the law is another part of the “solar coaster” — an industry euphemism about the ups and downs of solar tax credits. This part of the coaster, Carson said, will result in less investment.

“This change in law and the uncertainty from the president's executive order, it just means that less projects are going to get built in the short term,” Carson said.

Carson, a longtime campaign and White House staffer under former President Barack Obama, founded Trajectory Energy Partners in 2017.

“We fundamentally believe that this is a real bump in the road for solar, it's a bump in the road for individual projects, but that ultimately the United States needs more power, and it's going to come from wind, solar and battery storage,” he said, referencing three technologies Trump is against.

Others in the industry have raised flags that the “bump in the road” may be more obtrusive for some companies.

The investment tax credit that’s ending under the new law offers a credit of 30% of project costs, with an optional 10% on top of that if a project meets certain labor standards. A similar tax credit exists for both residential and commercial projects.

Brian Haug, president of Oak Brook-based Continental Energy Solutions, said the credit is a “critical” part of Continental’s business model.

“The investment tax credit is a perfect tool that we use to make these projects financially interesting for larger companies,” Haug said.

Continental works on microgrids, rooftop solar and battery storage projects for commercial and industrial customers and claims to be the largest solar installer in the state.

Solar installation companies, customers and individuals still have time qualify for tax credits at the higher, Biden-era rates. Eligible projects must commence construction within the next 12 months or be placed in service by the end of 2027, almost a decade ahead of what was outlined in the IRA.

The rapid sunset has resulted in a short-term boom in requests for solar projects, according to Windfree Solar CEO Eric Heineman, whose Chicago-based company installs solar for commercial and residential projects.

“We don’t know how it’s going to impact us in the long term. What we know in the short term is that we know we have buyers who have been dragging their feet, they’ve got proposals for years with us, and now they’re just coming out of the woodwork,” Heineman said. “They’re signing up left and right.”

But even for projects started today, there’s not a guarantee they will receive any tax benefits from the federal government. Trump’s executive order signaled that his administration could revise guidance on what counts as the “beginning of construction.”

Illinois’ renewable haven 

Illinois has increasingly subsidized the solar industry in recent years, most notably through the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA. That state law significantly expanded programs like Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All, which provide incentives to individuals and solar developers.

At a campaign stop while the Trump-backed spending plan was being considered in Congress earlier this month, Gov. JB Pritzker said Illinois’ policy wouldn’t be affected by the feds’ repeal of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.

“We put that bill together before the IRA was passed at the federal level, and so we anticipated that we needed to incentivize clean energy, and we did,” Pritzker said on July 2.

Industry experts credit the state’s policies generally, and CEJA specifically, for positioning the Illinois solar industry well as Trump’s policies threaten solar broadly.

Heineman, who was former Gov. Pat Quinn’s director of sustainability, pointed to the state’s solar renewable energy credit, or SREC, programs as a driving factor.

“Our sales are our revenue. Sales are driven by SRECs. If we don’t have revenue, we go out of business,” Heineman said. “Illinois is more insulated than any other state in the country.”

Heineman estimated that a typical solar project takes three years to pay for itself with current incentives. After the federal credit is repealed, it might take five years. Without state incentives, though, it could be as much as 10 years.

Battery credits

Some of the same lawmakers who were involved in passing CEJA are now pushing for a follow-up bill to offer incentives to the battery storage industry. That bill, a version of which was considered in the spring legislative session, could also include regulations of data centers, which are a major contributing factor to decreasing grid reliability and increasing energy prices.

Some environmental groups are using the federal spending plan as leverage to further push state lawmakers into supporting the initiative.

Illinois Environmental Council senior policy manager Cate Caldwell said the state has “long led” on environmental issues and that lawmakers should act in their shortened October legislative session.

“While this federal budget threatens to reverse that progress, Illinois can instead double down on its climate commitments and invest in real, bold climate solutions that modernize our grid, ensure energy-hungry data centers act as good neighbors, and deliver cost savings to hardworking families across the state,” she said in a statement last week.

Hiccups in Illinois’ climate record  

Despite the overall positive sentiments from the renewable energy industry and environmental lobby, the state has failed to live up to the promises it made in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, according to a report from the state’s auditor general.

That audit report, released last week, found that the state’s Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity failed to properly implement requirements for at least four jobs or workforce programs outlined in CEJA, including ones aimed at finding jobs for people returning from prison and to help communities disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution.

In the report, the Department acknowledged its errors and noted that it had hired someone to manage one of the programs in an interim capacity.

A DCEO spokesperson said the department has made “substantial progress on key initiatives” since the audit was conducted, including approving grant recipients in many of the programs listed in the report and launching community-hubs for people seeking jobs in the renewable sector.

His attorney, Edward Zeineh, said then that the facts would vindicate his client. Friske also issued a public statement on June 24, 2024, and denied any wrongdoing.
It was later revealed that Lansing police had requested Dewane to issue warrants charging Friske for felony sexual assault, felony assault and a felony weapons offense.

(Courtesy SFCC)If you are like me, you are still reeling from the news that the “big beautiful bill” (which is unparalleled in its ugliness) received the necessary votes in the U.S. House and Senate, along with the president’s signature. Although the U.S. Senate was close (and Dem senators all voted nay) what kind of madness is this? The very notion of passing legislation that dismantles Medicaid; blunts the effectiveness of nutritional assistance; and cuts funding to rural hospitals highlights the degree that a philosophy of philistine self-interest has infiltrated the current political climate. Trepidation over the fallout spreads nationwide.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham says the bill “will hit New Mexico hard” and state officials have outlined nightmarish scenarios in which more than 88,000 New Mexicans lose Medicaid and more than 58,000 to lose their Supplemental Assistance Program help.
“This is draconian,” Victor Pineda, executive director of the Center for Independent Living in Berkeley, California, which provides quality of life assistance to the disabled, reportedly said. “The cuts are a direct hit to our ability to help people stay in their homes who will now be forced into homelessness or institutions.”
In the meantime, what can help supplement the loss of basic services in underserved communities?  What can cities and mayors do?
For one thing: They can put more of their remaining resources toward expanding guaranteed income programs.
In 2018, Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, Calif. initiated the first guaranteed income program in the USA, which for two years gave $500 every month to 125 low-income residents. A study in the program’s aftermath conducted by a team of independent researchers determined that the money significantly improved participants’ mental health and financial standing. Tubbs then founded Mayors for Guaranteed Income (MGI), a network of committed cities that have sponsored pilot programs in cities including Madison, Wis.; Pittsburgh, Pa; New Orleans, La.; and Santa Fe, here in New Mexico.
In 2021, with an MGI grant, Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber launched a pilot program that provided $400-per-month stipends to 100 young, low-income Santa Fe Community College students with child-caretaking responsibilities. A 2025 independent study again concluded that rather than fulfilling easy cliches — meaning the assumption the young grantees would waste the funds on alcohol or video games — participants experienced meaningful improvements in key takeaway areas
“This successful program directly addresses the fundamental problem that is holding New Mexico back: poverty.” said Mayor Webber, after the report was released.
Today, more than 100 cities have sponsored direct cash payment programs that lasted one year (or preferably two years). In every case, most participants experienced admirable gains in food and housing security.  In Santa Fe, participants experienced a 19 percentage point rise in full employment.
But why should these results be surprising when 37% of Americans say they fear an unexpected $400 expense? A consistent extra few hundred (in lieu of having an empty bank account) can make a difference, a larger-than-expected step forward.
For proponents, an important assurance is that guaranteed income programs come with “no strings attached.” A family that needs money to pay for school supplies can choose this option; a recipient who knows that buying a car would be a valuable investment can save for that. Guaranteed income programs have been praised for having an “entrepreneurial”  spirit. But I believe the better word for them is “self-empowering” in that they encourage the underprivileged to value themselves and invest in their own futures.
These humble sums of cash directed without stipulations at crisis communities, including immigrant families, students or homeless youth, provide a measurable boost. Related programs stipulate the money is spent toward specific goals, like preventing homelessness. Funding for renters facing eviction  is one of the most important ways cities, including Santa Fe, can potentially use targeted funds in a time when homelessness  is at its highest level since the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development began keeping statistics in 2007.
Here is the rub. These programs abet and enhance the social safety net. They cannot replace it.  These programs are a tool: a necessary weapon. Times may become desperate. Cities must fight back.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/campus1848-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.

The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

– Michael Coen, chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations


Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.

Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.

Weather agency cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

The River Debris Cleanup Program will include $10 million in state funding provided by the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management, according to a press release from Monday.
MountainTrue executive director Bob Wagner said in the group’s announcement that the partnership is more than a cleanup.
“It’s a recovery effort grounded in our core values: clean water, healthy ecosystems, and resilient communities,” Wagner wrote.
Federal aid helped with addressing major rivers and large debris after the storm, while MountainTrue will focus on smaller streams and tributaries that are left clogged with trash, broken infrastructure, and storm debris, according to the announcement.
The program will deploy paid cleanup crews across western North Carolina to remove debris from rivers and streams for the next 18 months. It will also communicate with landowners to access and restore hard-to-reach areas.
During the program’s pilot phase, MountainTrue staff and volunteers have already removed about 3 million pounds of debris, Wagner wrote.
With funding from the state, MountainTrue will clean more than 150 miles of river throughout the region. The organization currently has volunteer operations established on the French Broad, Green, Broad, and Watauga Rivers, and will work towards expanding in other areas.
“We’re committed to helping western North Carolina recover and rebuild, and this investment will help clean up debris still left in our rivers,” said Reid Wilson, Secretary of the NC Department of Environmental Quality. “This initiative represents a critical opportunity to restore our waterways, protect our communities and support local economies dependent on outdoor recreation and tourism.”

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A new child tax credit is coming next year, bringing significant changes that will alter how much assistance families receive — and which families can receive it.
With his tax and spending package, President Donald Trump passed a permanent change to the child tax credit spearheaded by congressional Republicans. It goes into effect for families filing income tax returns in 2026.
The changes increase the total amount of the tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200, and index it to inflation so it grows over the years, a change advocates have championed for years. However, the package also introduces new parameters to qualify for the credit that will directly affect immigrants and the lowest-income families.
For the first time, children and at least one of their parents or guardians will have to have a Social Security number to be able to qualify for the child tax credit. That means an estimated 2.7 million American kids who likely qualify for the credit this year will no longer be able to get it as of next year.
The tax credit was passed in 1997. Families have used it to help cover basic needs like food and also wants, like getting their children into extracurricular activities.
But for its nearly 30-year history, the credit has been structured in a way that families with the lowest incomes couldn’t get the full amount. With the most recent change, and because the credit phases in depending on income and the number of children you have, families have to earn more before they can claim the full amount.
Democrats had been pushing to change those requirements in recent years so that the lowest-income families could get more of the credit, but Republicans pushed back, saying it disincentivized people to work.
Under the new child tax credit, an estimated 19 million children are now blocked from receiving the full amount, compared with 17 million currently, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, which has done much of the research and analysis on the child tax credit. The share of children from marginalized backgrounds who are not going to be able to receive the full amount has also gone up for each group:

48 percent of American Indian or Alaska Native children (from 45 percent under the current law)
45 percent of Black children (from 41 percent)
39 percent of Latinx children (from 34 percent)
60 percent of children of single mothers (from 55 percent)
35 percent of children in rural parts of the country (from 30 percent)

“Families of all sizes are going to need higher levels of income to be eligible for the full credit amount,” said Christopher Yera, a research analyst at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. The child tax credit is being cut at a time when other vital services for low-income Americans are seeing reduction.
Under the same tax package, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is losing $186 billion in funding through 2034, affecting eligibility for free school meals and for families that rely on the assistance to put food on the table. Another $1 trillion will be cut from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the next decade.
“All these families that are going to lose access to basic needs, it would be handy if the folks harmed by that were actually reached by the child tax credit,” said Meredith Dodson, the senior director of public policy for the Coalition on Human Needs who has been lobbying for an expansion of the credit.
Here is a breakdown of how the new child tax credit works and how to access it:
What is the child tax credit?
The child tax credit is a return parents and guardians receive in their taxes annually for every child under the age of 17 in their care. Stepchildren, foster children, half siblings and descendants, including grandchildren and nieces or nephews, may also qualify if the tax filer is their main caretaker.
Since 2017, the most families could claim from the credit is $2,000 per child, and that amount goes down after a certain threshold.
Guardians who earn very little or nothing have never been able to claim the full amount of the credit except for in 2021, when it temporarily expanded during the pandemic.
What is the new child tax credit amount? 
For the 2025 tax filing year, the child tax credit will increase to $2,200. Eligible parents will see this amount in their tax returns next year.
The credit will also be adjusted annually to account for inflation beginning in 2026.
Who qualifies for the new child tax credit? 
If filing a single return, parents and guardians must have a Social Security number to access the credit. This is a significant departure from prior years when only the children, but not the adults claiming them, had to have a Social Security number.
For parents and guardians who are filing jointly, only one parent has to have a Social Security number to qualify. That means some mixed-status households will be able to qualify for the credit.
To be able to claim a child, the child has to have:

Lived with the parent or caregiver for at least six months during 2025 (though there are some exceptions)
Lived six months or more in the United States
Have a Social Security number

The shift is part of a years-long effort to limit immigrants’ access to government services. Before 2017, any child living in the United States was eligible for the child tax credit. Then Trump’s tax cuts package in 2017 changed that rule to require that the child have a Social Security number to qualify. Their parents could use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, to file their taxes and still be eligible for the credit. Now at least one of those parents will need to also have a Social Security number.
Families headed by an undocumented single parent, where the child is an American citizen, will not get the child tax credit at all.
“Instead of actually expanding the [child tax credit], they took it away from millions of kids,” Dodson said. “There are important changes [in the law] but they kind of miss the mark when the whole thing is leaving out the folks who need it the most.”
Does everyone who qualifies get $2,200? 
No. Families who earn less than $2,500 a year do not receive anything. After that, the credit begins to phase in depending on how much families earn. (Keep reading for exact figures)
Some families earn little and owe no taxes. Those families are eligible for only a portion of the child tax credit, up to $1,700 in 2025. That means that even if your tax liability is zero, you can still receive a check for up to $1,700 for the child tax credit.
Then, the credit starts to phase out once families earn too much to qualify for the full amount. For a single filer, the credit starts to decrease for any amount they earn past $200,000; for joint filers the threshold is $400,000. Caregivers earning more than $240,000 for a single filer and $440,000 for joint filers do not receive anything.
What is the minimum you need to earn to qualify for the full amount? 
According to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University:

Families with one child: A single filer needs to earn at least $28,700; joint filers need to earn at least $36,500.
Families with two children: A single filer needs to earn at least $33,700; joint filers need to earn at least $41,500.
Families with three children: A single filer needs to earn at least $38,700; joint filers need to earn at least $46,500.
Families with four children: A single filer needs to earn at least $45,800; joint filers need to earn at least $51,500.

Who doesn’t qualify? 
Children who don’t have a Social Security number don’t qualify. Single parents or guardians who don’t have a Social Security number also don’t qualify, even if the child does have a Social Security number.
An estimated 28 percent of children will not qualify for the full amount because their parents earn too little. That is up from 25 percent previously, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Policy at Columbia. The share of kids who are ineligible because their parents earn too much stays the same, at 4 percent.
The states with the largest share of children who don’t qualify for the full amount are Mississippi (40.6 percent), Louisiana (38.2 percent), New Mexico (38.2 percent), Alabama (35.1 percent) and Kentucky (34.9 percent).
How do you claim the credit in your taxes? 
Filers must include their children or dependents on Form 1040, the Individual Income Tax Return, and also complete a Schedule 8812.
Is this like the child tax credit in 2021? 
No. In 2021, that credit was expanded to give families up to $3,600, much of it in the form of monthly checks, instead of an annual lump sum. The 2021 expansion allowed the poorest families in the country, those who don’t file income taxes, to access the child tax credit for the first time in its history. Those pandemic-era changes cut the child poverty rate in 2021 to a historic low of 5.2 percent.
But the temporary changes lasted only a year, and an effort by Democrats to make them permanent failed. The tax credit then reverted back to its usual amount — $2,000 — and the child poverty rate rose to 12.4 percent in 2022.
Is this a temporary change or a permanent one? 
This is a permanent change. Previous child tax credit expansions have been in place for a set number of years and when it was time for those changes to expire, lawmakers renegotiated the new parameters.
That is why the child tax credit came up this year — changes put in place in 2017 were set to expire in 2025.
What the new version does differently is make the changes permanent. Lawmakers can still tweak the credit if they want to later, but there is no set date where the changes will end and the credit will revert back to a former amount.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1367212888-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A trio of Indiana’s budget leaders iterated their confidence in the state’s finances at the end of the 2025 fiscal year with $2.5 billion in the bank.
“Hoosiers can remain confident that our financial footing is stable, despite a year marked by economic fluctuations and a lower-than-expected forecast,” said State Comptroller Elise Nieshalla. “Our reserve continues to serve as a practical safeguard, reflecting Indiana’s commitment to fiscal responsibility.”
In April, the state projected it would receive $2 billion less than expected in a revenue forecast, forcing lawmakers to scramble to make cuts near the tail end of the 2025 legislative session. Indiana’s fiscal year starts on July 1 and ends on June 30.
“It was a bleak day, if you recall,” summarized Lisa Hershman, the secretary of Management and Budget. “We were clinging, I would say, and hoping for a $14 million surplus. I’m proud to say, we far exceeded that.”
The surplus for the 2025 fiscal closeout was $337 million, a number buoyed by advanced tax payments usually paid in December.
“So next year, we start out down $160 million,” said Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis.
DeLaney and Rep. Greg Porter, another Indianapolis Democrat, noted that the closeout doesn’t factor in the impact from President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which will cost Indiana hundreds of millions of dollars.
“I have asked the budget director to get us that information … and not wait for the (next) forecast in December. Because the legislature needs to know and the public needs to know what the impact is,” DeLaney continued.
That $2.5 billion reserve amount is enough to fund state government for 40 days with no new revenue, within the 30-60 day range considered generally advisable.
Reserves will be 11.2% of Indiana’s spending, at the lower end of the 10-15% recommended to maintain Indiana’s AAA bond rating.

(Courtesy of Save the Bay)The embattled Quidnessett Country Club is facing more scrutiny after failing to submit the required restoration plan of its shoreline to state coastal regulators by the July 10 deadline.
The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council is scheduled to revisit the matter at its upcoming July 22 meeting, according to a July 14 letter from agency staff to Jennifer Cervenka, one of Quidnessett’s attorneys. The letter was obtained by Rhode Island Current. 
The letter does not specify whether the appointed council will take additional action, including new penalties, against the North Kingstown country club for an illegal seawall built along its shoreline more than two years ago. That will be up to the council to decide, Jeff Willis, executive director for the CRMC, said in an email.
Robin Main, another attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment when reached by phone Tuesday. 
CRMC orders Quidnessett to come up with a plan to remove seawall, restore shoreline

The saga of the 600-foot-long rock wall built in defiance of state coastal regulations has become a flashpoint in ongoing debate over the effectiveness and fairness of the politically appointed state coastal panel. Critics condemned the council for a drawn-out review of Quidnessett’s case that so far, has had no consequences for the country club despite clear violations of state coastal requirements for sensitive waters. The CRMC issued a cease and desist to country club owners in August 2023 after discovering the seawall built along the edge of its golf course, sometime in the winter of the prior year. 
Facing financial penalties, the country club owners originally sought to ease development restrictions by reclassifying the waters along its coastline. If granted, the request could have allowed a permanent barrier like a seawall. After a protracted review and series of contentious public hearings, the council rejected the water type reclassification in January. Since then, the club and agency staff have been unable to agree on details of a shoreline restoration plan, including the slope and location of a natural barrier between the water’s edge and adjacent golf course. Quidnessett submitted five plans to the CRMC, all deemed by staff as  “unacceptable” based on state coastal regulations.
In June, the dispute returned before the appointed council, which finally set a timeline for the country club to remove the seawall and restore the shoreline. The council’s unanimous June 11 vote gave Quidnessett 30 days — until July 10 — to submit a new restoration plan, with another three months to perform the work after a plan was approved.
However, the council’s June vote failed to prescribe any details of what the forthcoming restoration work should entail, despite a recommendation from staff environmental scientist Brian Harrington laying out specific requirements for replantings and the location of the “toe of berm.” 
Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, was unsurprised to learn Quidnessett failed to turn in a new plan by the deadline, given the lack of clarity in the council’s prior order.
“The council should have known that without providing that specificity, we’d be back here in 30 days with no agreement reached,” Thorp said in an interview. 
“Quidnessett was basically saying, ‘We need to be told what to do,’” Thorp said of what Cervenka said during the June 11 meeting. “Hopefully, the council responds in some way that provides clarity and more clearly directs them on what needs to be done.”
Thorp characterized the repeated delays and inaction by the council as further support for Save the Bay-backed bill that would have reshaped the CRMC as an administrative agency akin to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The bill failed to advance out of committee in both chambers during the 2025 legislative session — the third consecutive year — though lawmakers agreed this year to a more modest tweak to the council’s size and members’ professional qualifications. 
“If you had more of a DEM-style structure, this would have been resolved months ago,” Thorp said. “Instead, we’ve seen delay after delay after delay.”
The CRMC will next meet at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, July 22, at the William E. Powers Department of Administration building in Providence. A meeting agenda has not yet been posted.

Milky skies were carrying smoke and haze from Canadian wildfires across northern and central Vermont on Tuesday — prompting state officials to issue a two-day air quality alert across the state. 
Smoke and haze rolled in early Tuesday morning and are expected to linger through the afternoon and night, according to Tyler Danzig, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Burlington. 
Officials warned that sensitive groups should take breaks and monitor their conditions when spending time outdoors. 
Individuals with heart or lung issues, older adults, children, people who work outside and those experiencing homelessness are especially at risk, according to state health officials. Sensitive groups can spend time outside but should take more breaks than usual, according to officials. 
People with asthma are recommended to keep medication handy. Those with heart disease should watch out for palpitations, fatigue and shortness of breath. 
Sensitive groups could continue to feel the effects of exposure up to 24 hours after the haze has passed, according to Danzig. 
The alert spans across Grand Isle, Franklin, Orleans, Essex, Chittenden, Lamoille, Caledonia, Washington, Addison and Orange counties. 
Officials recommend Vermonters sign up for air quality alerts, limit their exposure and keep an eye on forecasts. 
The smoke and haze are coming from wildfires in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Danzig said. Many of those fires have been ablaze for weeks and caused similar conditions in Vermont earlier this summer.
Skies may tinge orange this evening, but the air should clear overnight, Danzig said. The alert stands all day Tuesday and will likely be extended for another day, according to Bennet Leon, who monitors air quality for the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)DE SOTO, Kansas — Hundreds from around the world gathered Monday to celebrate the grand opening of the Panasonic electric vehicle battery plant in De Soto and tour the 4.7 million-square-foot facility that claims the tag of the state’s biggest economic development project ever.
The Japanese ambassador to the United States, Panasonic leaders, and local, regional and national elected officials praised the partnership required to bring the project to fruition. Panasonic is expected to invest $4 billion in the plant, and the Kansas Department of Commerce estimates it will bring $2.5 billion to the state’s economy annually.
The state offered $829 million in incentives to Panasonic through the Attracting Powerful Economic Expansion Act, or APEX.
“Just two and a half years ago, November 22, we stood on this very ground,” said Allan Swan, president and chief operating officer of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America. “At that point, it was just a big open field, but we had a whole vision to build a world-class facility that would power the future of clean transportation, create thousands of jobs, new high-quality jobs, and serve as the catalyst for economic growth in Kansas and across the region.”
“Today,” he said, “that vision is a reality.”
One week ago, the first production line began operating, and it will take three to four months for it to achieve full capacity, Swan said after the ceremony.
By early January, Swan said, three additional lines will be operating and construction will begin on a second wing of the building, which is expected to house an additional four lines in about 18 months.
Currently, the plant makes about 50,000 battery cells per day — at a rate of about 70 per second — and employs 1,100 people, Swan said. It is expected to employ 4,000 people when at full capacity.
Reports by international media that decreased Tesla sales will delay the move to full capacity are just part of being in a new business, Swan said.
“We’re in a brand new industry,” he said. “That industry is going to ebb and flow a little bit as she grows, and she will grow, and we’re clearly growing in one direction. It’s not going to change. The beauty of Kansas is we can build these lines out. We’ve got customers that want them, so we should be in a good place.”
Batteries won’t begin to ship out to customers for three or four weeks because of rigorous safety and quality testing, Swan said.

 The marketplace

Customers who will use the electric vehicle batteries in their products were in attendance, including representatives from Lucid Motors, Toyota, Harbinger Motors and Tesla. Nick Twork, spokesman for Lucid, said they were pleased to see a new plant built.
“It’s really great because obviously it allows us to have a domestic supply chain for battery cells,” he said. “This facility will start supplying us next year, and we’ll ship batteries to our factory in Arizona.”
Upcoming changes to U.S. policies, like eliminating tax credits for buying electric cars, aren’t really something that concerns Lucid, Twork said.
“As long as it’s a level playing field, that’s the most important thing,” he said. “Obviously that’s going to affect the marketplace, so we’ll adapt as necessary. We’re an agile business, and we’ll do what it takes.”
Twork said he wasn’t willing to comment on any acrimony the public is feeling about Tesla products and reports the company’s sales are down.
“From our standpoint, we’ve had six consecutive quarters of record growth for the company,” he said. “We keep selling more vehicles, so more and more customers are finding out about
what Lucid has to offer.”

 Supply chains

U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran spoke at the ceremony and afterward said trade negotiations need to take place to get rid of barriers that keep U.S. products out of international markets.
“But as I’ve indicated to the ambassador today, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that the outcome of those conversations between Japan and the United States are beneficial to both countries,” Moran said.
The federal government wants supply chains brought home, he said.
“This is an example of where business that was being done outside the United States will now be done in the United States,” he said of the Panasonic plant.
Swan said Panasonic is working to bring more suppliers to locate in the United States. Three already have space in the De Soto plant.
“It’s an ongoing process, and we’ll keep working with our suppliers who already exist to see whether we can get them here to the United States, or find another way of creating a stronger supply chain,” Swan said.
There are still 6,000 acres near the plant that could be used for expansion or where suppliers could build. Swan said the company would like to see that developed and is working with the state of Kansas to bring suppliers “as close as possible.”
Swan praised the De Soto plant as the largest plant his company has built with top-of-the-line manufacturing capabilities.
“We built the first one with Tesla over in Nevada, so that’s their factory. This is our factory,” he said. “We’ve redesigned it to make it quite more productive. There is roughly 10% less machinery here and a lot more automation, so that’s where the innovation comes in. The lines here are the fastest lines that we’ve ever had.”
The labor-saving production lines are expected to achieve approximately 20% higher productivity compared to the Nevada factory, a press release said.
 Workforce training

All of those who spoke Monday highlighted the partnerships that it took to make such a large project successful. Speakers repeatedly mentioned the collaboration with local community colleges to help the company train the workforce it needs.
Greg Mosier, president of the Kansas City Kansas Community College, said new programs at the school train Panasonic’s entry level skilled maintenance technicians and advanced engineering technicians.
The program is a mix of schooling at the community college and working at the Panasonic plant, he said.
“We developed it in partnership with Panasonic, and then it’s also 16 credit hours, so they get a college certificate with it as well,” Mosier said. “It’s an apprenticeship model, so they are on the regular 16-week schedule. They do two days at the college, three days at the factory.”
In response to a Panasonic request, the community college was able to condense the program to eight weeks, he said. After completing the course and working full time at Panasonic, Mosier said, students are earning $50,000 to $60,000 per year.

 Japanese investment

The investments Panasonic is making in Kansas will strengthen the state’s economy and do much more, said Yasuaki Takamoto, CEO of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America.
“What happens here is just the first step in building a stable and secure domestic supply chain, one that’s becoming a reality thanks to our ongoing investment and partnership,” he said. “We are supporting domestic production with critical EV components, strengthening North America’s manufacturing ecosystems and helping America maintain its competitive edge.”
Takamoto said that selecting Kansas for the plant meant choosing the community and the workforce they believed in.
“Since then, we built relationships that will last for years to come,” he said.
Japanese ambassador Shigeo Yamada highlighted the strong relationship between the United States and Japan, saying Japan has been the strongest investor in the United States in the past 50 years and has created 1 million jobs.
“Japanese investment in this country is about much more than just dollars and cents,” he said. “By working hand-in-hand with local communities, Japanese companies are building enduring ties and a sense of trust with their peoples. These personal ties — connections — form the very foundation on which the bilateral relationship is built and allowing us to collaborate, not just as allies, but as trusted friends.”

Photo by J.W. Hendricks for CalMattersAn effort is being co-led by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to urge passage of legislation that seeks to generally prohibit federal immigration agents from wearing masks to conceal their identity and requiring them to show their identification and agency-identifying insignia. 
The coalition of 21 attorneys general sent a letter Tuesday to members of Congress, expressing concern over escalating incidents involving masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dressed in plainclothes and driving unmarked vehicles detaining people on streets and at homes, workplaces, and courthouses. 
“We have watched these detentions with alarm, as the imagery evokes comparisons to repressive tactics that have no place in a free country,” the letter says. “ICE officers’ now routine practice of carrying out arrests in public spaces through masked agents who do not identify themselves as law enforcement has the effect of terrorizing communities rather than protecting them.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The legislation the coalition is supporting includes the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement, or VISIBLE, Act of 2025, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin.
In a video, Nessel addressed the dangers of immigration enforcement being conducted by agents without identification.  
“We’ve already seen cases where bad actors are simulating this behavior to apprehend whomever they want and it’s only a matter of time before an officer is seriously hurt by a good guy attempting to stop what appears to be a kidnapping right before their own eyes,” Nessel said.

In a press release, Nessel also noted that the current ICE tactics contradict Michigan’s resisting and obstructing statute, in which a person is only guilty of those crimes if they knew, or had reason to know, that the individual issuing a command was a police officer. Similarly, officers executing home search warrants are typically required to announce their presence to prevent unnecessary escalation and ensure the safety of both citizens and law enforcement.  
While the coalition acknowledged that there may be certain limited instances in which it might be appropriate for federal agents to conceal their identities, they warn in the letter that “widespread, unchecked use of masks and plainclothes enforcement undermines democratic principles, erodes public trust, and invites civil rights abuses.”

With temperatures edging past 90 degrees by midday, faith leaders and community members gathered outside Binkley Baptist Church on Saturday in Chapel Hill, holding signs and silent prayers as part of a statewide solidarity fast to demand humanitarian aid for Gaza. 
They stood beneath the July sun as an act of moral witness, urging U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis to help ensure aid reaches civilians in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory, where United Nations officials say Israeli restrictions have allowed only a fraction of necessary food and medical supplies to enter. 
  Mark Davidson, executive director of Voices for Justice in Palestine (Photo: Ahmed Jallow)
“Palestinians say despair is betrayal,” said Mark Davidson, executive director of Voices for Justice in Palestine and one of the event’s organizers. “When we give up because it seems hard or depressing or hopeless, we’re abandoning people.” 
The vigil marked the 35th day in a rolling statewide fast led by Jewish Voice for Peace-Triangle and supported by groups like Durham Friends Meeting, Bullhorn Arts and Education, and the NC Environmental Justice Network. Members fasted for 24-hour shifts in rotation, abstaining from food and water in symbolic solidarity. 
“We’re not called to be successful, we’re called to be faithful,” Davidson said. “Do the right thing, and amazing things can happen.” 
The gathering comes as the war in Gaza has left large parts of the territory flattened, and nearly 60,000 Palestinians killed, the majority of them civilians.  
Israel launched its military response following the October 7 Hamas attack that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities. 
Human Rights Watch have accused Israeli officials of using starvation as a weapon of war, a claim Israel denies.  
Participants echoed those concerns. They called for Tillis, who co-chairs the Senate Human Rights Caucus, to back restoring U.S. funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), and to push for halting additional weapons shipments to Israel.

“I would love for us to actually put that funding to the aid we’re claiming to try to put in,” said Kate Lindrum, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace-Triangle. “No matter how governments or politicians may want to spin it, people are out here, and you can’t just tell them to not believe their eyes.” 
Organizers framed the event as both a spiritual act and a political one. Rev. Dr. Marcus McFaul, Binkley Baptist’s senior minister, described the vigil as an extension of the church’s core mission. 
“Having food, shelter, and dignity is a moral issue,” McFaul said. “Churches deal in moral concerns and moral ethical issues.”

The event was notably multifaith, bringing together Christians, Jews, and secular activists. Organizers said Binkley Baptist is the largest faith community yet to join the NC to Gaza Solidarity Fast. Other participating groups include Makom Triangle, Farm Church, and Durham Community Fridges. 
Davidson reminded those gathered of words from Nelson Mandela: “It’s impossible until it is done.” 
The group plans to continue fasting in shifts throughout the summer, aiming to sustain public pressure and attention. 
“This isn’t just for a week, it’s not even for a month, it’s not even for a year,” McFaul said, quoting late civil rights leader John Lewis. “It’s for the long haul.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7122313-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
The feds pull back
Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.

As North Carolina continues its recovery work from Helene and the recent flooding from Tropical Storm Chantal, Gov. Josh Stein has made clear that continued assistance from FEMA remains essential. In a recent interview with CNBC touting the state’s top ranking for doing business, he echoed the view that states are in no position to handle disaster recovery on their own.
“It doesn’t make sense for each state to have a fully staffed emergency response team because they may not have a storm for five-years or 10 years. But we know the country will,” Stein said. He added that North Carolina still has an $11.5 billion request for storm recovery before Congress and the Trump administration that he hopes will be funded “soon.”

Disaster declarations
In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

Trump administration to reverse a decades-old policy that gave people without permanent legal status access to certain federal benefits, including care at community health centers, behavioral health programs and Head Start.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last week announced it would bar undocumented residents from accessing taxpayer-funded federal programs. Among the more than a dozen initiatives affected is the Health Center Program, which provides funding to community-based health providers.
Connecticut has 17 federally qualified health centers with more than 300 facilities. The centers serve about 440,000 people annually statewide, including more than 70,000 who are uninsured. 
Of those, officials estimate that anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 patients per year are undocumented residents, who are charged for services based on a sliding fee scale. The health centers don’t have a more precise number because employees do not inquire about patients’ immigration statuses, said Deb Polun, chief strategy officer for the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut.
For now, the FQHCs are continuing to serve everyone who shows up for care while they await further information from HHS, Polun said.
“There is a lot of fear and confusion,” she said. “It’s a fundamental shift in how health centers do business. Our mission is to try to serve all residents, to help create healthier communities, to help people get and stay healthy so they can live high quality lives and contribute to their local economies. This changes the way they will have to do business. It will lead to people being sicker.”
Without access to primary care at community health centers, Polun said, more people will put off treatment and end up in hospital emergency departments when medical care is badly needed.
“We’ve already had patients fearful of becoming detained or deported, so we’ve seen a change in some of the behaviors — more cancelations, more, ‘Can we switch this to telehealth instead of coming in?’ This is one more obstacle, one more barrier to them being able to access health care,” she said.
Leaders at community health centers say the move is complicated by federal regulations that also require them to provide care to all residents in their service areas.
“Community Health Centers are required by federal law to ensure access to health care for all residents in their service areas. This is core to their mission to build healthier communities,” Shawn K. Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, said in a statement. “[The] notice from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services raises significant questions about how community health centers in Connecticut and across the country can continue to meet their legal and moral obligations.”
The move could mean having to ask for and verify patients’ immigration statuses at facilities and turn away people who receive coverage through the state’s HUSKY for immigrants program, which offers government-sponsored health benefits to certain undocumented residents, officials said. As of April, 15,600 kids in Connecticut were enrolled in the program.
Aside from undocumented immigrants, access to care could also be rolled back for children covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, refugees and individuals granted asylum under the new rule, health officials said.
Attorney General William Tong said his office is “evaluating all legal options” in response to the recent notice.
“When you deny huge swaths of people access to affordable community-based health care, their medical needs do not go away,” Tong said in a statement. “They get sicker, their problems become more severe, more life threatening and more expensive to treat. And then they show up in emergency rooms — often too late. No one thinks this is a good idea — not the health centers, not the hospitals, and least of all not the Connecticut families who will be hurt by this needless cruelty.” 
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, co-chair of the legislature’s Public Health Committee and a physician, called the move “short sighted.”
“We know the cost of health care goes up for everyone if preventive treatments are not provided. People residing in our communities, if they receive preventive treatment, they are less likely to have emergencies,” he said. “If treatment is not received because of fear or other decisions, the actual cost of health care for everyone will increase, and this is not a good financial decision.”
In a joint statement, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, and Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, said they did not interpret the announcement as a ban on services for undocumented residents.
“Per the administration, they have stated that these efforts are aimed at protecting taxpayer-funded benefits and vital resources for American citizens,” the senators said. “There does not seem to be any indication that someone who has illegal status cannot seek medical services at a federally qualified health center. The difference now is that they would have to pay for that service and the taxpayers would not be on the hook for their care. Federally qualified health centers are one of the least expensive options to access care. We are monitoring developments closely and will be talking to key stakeholders.”
Christine Stuart, a spokeswoman for Connecticut’s Department of Social Services, said the office is still assessing the impact of the federal decision on programs and on the state’s partner organizations.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-15 15:40:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Tired of slow drivers in the left lane? A new law targets ‘camping’ in CT,John Henry Smith | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/15/ct-law-left-lane-drivers-camping/,"A new CT state law will allow police to ticket drivers who ""camp"" in the passing lane without actively passing another vehicle.","If you’ve ever been stuck behind a slow driver cruising in the far left lane of a highway, Connecticut lawmakers are aiming to make your commute a little smoother.
Starting Oct. 1, 2026, a new state law will allow police to ticket drivers who “camp” in the passing lane without actively passing another vehicle.
“We are talking about all people, but mostly impeding the flow of traffic,” said State Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, who sponsored the legislation.
Clearing up the confusion
Cohen, a member of the General Assembly’s Transportation Committee, said the goal is to make left-lane expectations clear: “Folks say, ‘Why are people getting in the left lane and driving 50 miles per hour when the speed limit is 65?'”
Although current law technically discourages prolonged left lane driving, Cohen said it’s vague and ineffective.
“It says we shall drive in the right-hand lane, but doesn’t say anything specifically about left lane camping,” she said.
Connecticut is joining states like Massachusetts and New York in making the rule more explicit.
Reasonable exceptions
Cohen emphasized the law has exceptions.
“If there’s a left-lane exit that you need to get off, if there’s some sort of obstruction requiring you to get in the left lane, and of course, most of all being [for] passing vehicles that are on your right, those are all allowed,” she said.
She added that the rule won’t apply to two-lane highways.
Enforcement will be discretionary
Drivers traveling above the speed limit aren’t exempt. If they stay in the left lane for too long without passing, they could still be ticketed.
“That would be considered camping,” Cohen said. “The goal is to encourage drivers to treat the left lane as a passing lane and not a cruising lane.”
But how will police determine when someone’s been in the lane too long? Cohen said there is no specific mileage threshold.
“This is discretionary and law enforcement will be trained accordingly,” she said. “There would have to be a clear violation and infraction.”
Equity and awareness
Cohen said some initial concerns focused on potential inequities in enforcement. To address those, the law includes time for public education.
“We’re going to give the Department of Transportation time to create an awareness campaign around this,” Cohen said. “This is something that is taught in driver’s education classes, but now we have the clarity necessary on the books.”
Signage will also be added along highways before enforcement begins.
Learning from other states
Connecticut’s catching up to states like Massachusetts and New York, who already have similar laws in place, Cohen said.
“And what we’ve seen from other states is that when drivers really understand and respect the ‘keep right, pass left’ principle, roads just become less stressful and less congested and run more efficiently,” she said.
Cohen says she hopes the new law helps create a more cooperative driving culture.
“If we can all have some uniformity, particularly in the region,” she said, “that’s going to help us all.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)HAYS — The leaders of the state’s new Water Program Task Force say they are committed to finding elusive solutions to the state’s long-simmering water crisis.
Sen. Kenny Titus, a Republican attorney from Wamego, and Rep. Jim Minnix, a Republican farmer from Scott City who chairs the House Water Committee, appeared alongside Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly at a ceremony in Hays to outline their vision for the task force. The two lawmakers will co-chair a bipartisan group that includes business leaders and conservationists.
Their mission: Evaluate risks to water quality and quantity, build a management system that addresses those risks, and secure a dedicated revenue source to ensure the plan, like so many before, doesn’t just sit on a shelf.
“No big deal, of course,” Titus joked as he addressed a crowd that gathered on July 9 at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History to celebrate the passage of House Bill 2172, which established the task force.

“Our current challenges did not arise overnight, nor have they arisen from a lack of past efforts to address them,” Titus said.
He recalled efforts in recent history to address the state’s water crisis, including a previous task force, proposed restructuring of state agencies, increased funding for the state water plan, infrastructure investments, and “countless meetings and discussions.”
“But the problems have always been complex and long term,” Titus said. “Simple solutions have been elusive. We have in many cases talked the problems to death, and it’s been done generation after generation, and here we are with challenges persisting.”
The task force’s job, he said, is to build upon past plans “and help set a clear course for the state’s future.”
  Rep. Jim Minnix says he has full faith that Kansans can work together to address water issues. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Minnix said his hope is for the task force to “lay out a plan” in the next several years “to improve things dramatically.”
“I have full faith that we as Kansans can come together in a nonpartisan way and work on issues of water — and there’s a lot of things to work on, folks,” Minnix said.
At the ceremony, he had the responsibility of introducing the governor, but he had been busy with harvest and hadn’t prepared remarks about her.
Still, he set aside for a moment the “really pretty press release” her office had given him to read, and instead told the crowd know how much he enjoyed working with the governor.
“I really appreciate that she’s very genuine, has a good sense of humor, puts up with a lot of things there in Topeka,” Minnix said.
  Gov. Laura Kelly says the state’s water problems will get worse without immediate intervention. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Kelly, who said later that she felt the same way about Minnix, reminded the crowd in Hays of the challenges the state faces, and the importance of the task force.
The challenges include stabilizing the Ogallala Aquifer, reducing sediment in reservoirs, and ensuring access to reliable and safe drinking water and wastewater systems.
Some areas of the state have less than 25 years of usable water left, and 150 communities are at or above acceptable nitrate levels in drinking water, the governor said.
“These problems are here and now, and if we don’t act, they’re only going to get worse, and perhaps beyond repair,” Kelly said.
She said the task force is about more than just “creating a plan.”
“Plans tend to sit on shelves,” Kelly said. “This is about creating a funded, coordinated system of management that will set us up for the future, protect our communities and strengthen our economy.”
She pointed to Hays as a leader in implementing “an all hands on deck approach to water conservation.”
  Hays Mayor Sandy Jacobs says her city has been a leader in conservation efforts for years. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Hays Mayor Sandy Jacobs said city residents consume just 65% of the statewide average of water per capita. She praised the water task force as a way to address “critical challenges” surrounding water quality, conservation and management.
“Here in Hays, we understand firsthand how vital water is in our communities, our economy and our future for agriculture to infrastructure to environmental health,” Jacobs said.
The city for three decades has been mired in bureaucratic and legal wrangling over a plan to pipe water from a ranch in a neighboring county. Meanwhile, Jacobs said, the city voluntarily reduced its water supply by 30%, implemented a rebate program for water-saving toilets and appliances, hired the first water conservation specialist, and has educated elementary school children on “the benefits of using water wisely.”
Educational outreach efforts include support for a 4-H water ambassador program for teens and an annual poster contest that now draws 600 entries.

Holly Dickman, water conservation specialist for Hays, said the poster contest, which draws youth and adult entries, is one of the ways she educates the community about water conservation.
“You have to talk about it constantly to get the message out,” Dickman said.
She said Hays has been working to conserve water since the early 1990s while other communities are just getting started.
“We’re very conscientious about water use here,” Dickman said. “We actually get asked from other communities about how we do things, about some of our programs.”
The 4-H water ambassador initiative draws youths to learn more about water conservation and help educate others, said Jonas Kern, 17. He was a member of the group of teens who started the program, all from Barton and Ellis counties.
He and his brother, Russell Kern, 16, are ambassadors and understand the importance of water conservation after working on their family’s Barton County large-scale vegetable farm. In the ambassador program, they visit other areas to learn about challenges.
“We do a lot of programs presenting,” Jonas Kern said. “Last year, we went over to Garden City to learn about the different agriculture that they have to do there because it’s a lot drier than where I’m from in Barton County.”
Jonas Kern presented at the Governor’s Water Conference about the 4-H program and how other counties could start one. He’s interested in learning more as he plans for his future.
“I’m looking to maybe be a high school science teacher,” he said. “Water is one of the most important natural resources.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7090226-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

What is brain drain?
Brain drain refers to the departure of educated or skilled workers from an area, often in pursuit of higher-paying jobs or better living conditions. It is a pithy term for what economists call human capital flight. Brain drain can be measured according to gross brain drain, the share of educated residents born in the state who leave, and net brain drain, the relative outflow and inflow of educated residents. Unless otherwise specified, we will use the term brain drain to refer to net brain drain, which is the more important metric for the state’s economy and well-being. 
Brain drain also frequently shows up in connection with two related concepts: net outmigration and population loss.
Net outmigration occurs when the total number of people leaving an area exceeds the number of people moving in. Net migration includes both domestic migration, when native-born Americans move within the U.S., and international migration, when people move from and to foreign countries. In practice, places with net outmigration typically also suffer from a brain drain, because people with higher education tend to be more mobile than people without college degrees. 
Population loss is a decline in the total number of residents living in an area. Population change is calculated by a simple formula: net migration + natural change (births minus deaths.) A place experiencing net outmigration can still sustain a growing population if its birth rate is high enough to offset its deaths and departures. However, state and national birth rates have been sliding downward for decades, so population growth increasingly depends on positive net migration.

Why is brain drain a problem?
Brain drain is a vicious cycle that slows a place’s economy, shrinks its tax base, and frays its social fabric. When an area’s workforce and customer base shrinks, existing businesses lose talent and revenue, and new businesses do not open. Infrastructure and public services deteriorate as fewer — and less affluent — taxpayers shoulder the cost of maintaining them. Vacant houses and storefronts blight once-vibrant neighborhoods, inviting crime and lowering property values. Schools close or consolidate, and religious congregations and civic organizations die out. Each wave of departures leaves less reason for others to stay, perpetuating the downward spiral.
Brain drain widens regional, socioeconomic, and political divides. Americans have the freedom to move anywhere in the country, and many “vote with their feet” by leaving places that offer less opportunity, fewer amenities and worse quality of life than they can find elsewhere. But even though all Americans are free to move, moving is not free. High costs and uncertain job prospects often lock poorer, less educated and older residents in struggling places. The people most likely to leave are wealthier, more educated and younger. Brain drain widens these disparities: the people who can leave are often rewarded with higher salaries and upward mobility, while people who are stuck in declining areas struggle to hang on. It also amplifies the inequality between regions. Areas with economic and social advantages pull talent and resources away from places like Mississippi that are, literally, left behind. The gap between them is increasingly filled with political polarization and cultural resentment. 
Brain drain is a subsidy paid to other states. Mississippi taxpayers invest approximately $170,000 in the education of a child who passes through the state’s K-12 and public university system. When a graduate leaves to take a job elsewhere, the return on that investment is reaped by their new state. Mississippi imports far fewer graduates from other states than it exports. As a result, the taxpayers of the poorest state in America are subsidizing the economies and education systems of wealthier states, while Mississippi is left with fewer resources to invest in its communities and its next generation.

How many people is Mississippi losing? 
From 2010 to 2024, 80,000 more residents left the state than moved in, according to Census Bureau estimates. Put together, the net loss is greater than the population of Gulfport, the state’s second-largest city. Mississippi had the sixth-worst net migration rate in the country during that time. 
Net outmigration accelerated from 2010 to 2020, and it overtook the natural growth of the population starting in 2014. However, the Covid-19 pandemic put the brakes on the exodus. In the three years prior to 2020, Mississippi lost an average of 12,000 movers per year. In the three years from 2022 to 2024, 5,000 more people moved into Mississippi than moved away — the first period of inbound migration since the 1990s. Domestic movers still left Mississippi on balance, but their losses were offset by an increase in foreign immigration.
Despite the uptick in net migration, Mississippi’s total population has fallen faster since the pandemic. The state’s birth rate has declined in line with national trends, while deaths from Covid and other causes have spiked since 2020. In the past four years, 16,000 more Mississippians have died than been born. 
As a result, Mississippi’s 2024 population stood at 2,943,045 — down nearly 45,000 from its peak in 2014. The state ranks 49th in population change during the past decade, above only West Virginia. Mississippi now has almost 27,000 fewer residents than it did in the 2010 Census.

How does migration vary by education?
As we laid out before, there are two ways to define brain drain: gross brain drain, which compares the education levels of leavers and stayers, and net brain drain, which compares the education levels of leavers and newcomers. Of the two, net brain drain is the more important metric, but gross brain drain is the one we feel more, since it is easier to notice the loss of someone who moved away than someone who never moved in.
Gross Brain Drain: Among Mississippi natives ages 22 to 50, almost half of all four-year graduates have left the state, compared to just 30% without a four-year degree. This includes graduates of community colleges, who stay home at the same rate as Mississippians without any postsecondary education.

Net Brain Drain: For every Mississippian without a four-year degree who moves away, a person of a similar educational level moves in. But only two university graduates arrive for every three from Mississippi who leave, resulting in a net loss of 57,000 four-year graduates currently living in other states.

How does migration vary by age, race, and sex? 
Age: Every age group younger than 50 departs Mississippi in greater numbers than they arrive. Only when approaching retirement age are people more likely to move to Mississippi than leave. Losses are greatest in the years when people are beginning their careers. From 2010 to 2020, Mississippi lost one-tenth of its 25-to-34-year-old population – about 40,000 people – through net outmigration. 

Race: Net migration among Black and white people follows a similar age pattern. However, Black people move away at higher rates in their 20s and 30s, but they are more likely to move back in their 70s. Mississippi’s population of other racial groups is too small to generate reliable estimates by age. 
Sex: Both men and women move in line with the overall age pattern, but net outmigration is higher among men in their prime working years.

What parts of the state are losing the most people? What places are growing?
Nearly every part of the state is suffering from outmigration and brain drain. Between 2010 and 2020, 80% of the state’s 82 counties lost more people than they gained, including moves made inside the state and outside of it. Nationally, roughly half of counties were net exporters of population. 
Most of Mississippi’s shrinking counties are shrinking rapidly, while most of its growing counties are growing slowly. From 2010 to 2020, more than half of Mississippi’s counties ranked in the bottom 20% nationally in net migration rate (net migrants as a share of population). Only five counties ranked in the top 20%. 

There are patterns to which counties tend to lose or attract movers. Rural counties with low per capita income and low education rates lost the most people, while growth was concentrated in more affluent and educated places: suburban areas, university towns, and the Coast. Most of their growth came from people who moved from other parts of Mississippi — a brain drain within the state.

Where do Mississippians go? Where do newcomers move from? 
When Mississippians leave, they typically relocate to large metropolitan areas that are within driving distance of home. According to address changes in IRS tax filings from 2012 to 2022, the top destinations for people leaving Mississippi are Houston, Dallas, Memphis, Atlanta and New Orleans. Newcomers are most likely to move to Mississippi from Memphis, New Orleans, Mobile, Baton Rouge and Atlanta. 
In terms of net migration, Mississippi has added the most residents from Memphis, New Orleans, Mobile, Baton Rouge and Birmingham, while it has lost the most residents to Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta, Nashville and Orlando.

On a state level, Tennessee and Texas have drawn the most Mississippians, followed by Louisiana, Alabama and Florida. People who move to Mississippi tend to come from the same five states, in a slightly different order. Tennessee and Louisiana are the top two states of origin, followed by Texas, Alabama and Florida. 
Even though the same states appear at the top of both lists, net migration varies widely by state. In general, Mississippi has a negative migration rate with states that are attracting newcomers from other parts of the country, while it has a positive migration rate with states that are losing residents to other parts of the country. 
Texas added the most residents in exchange with Mississippi: 30,000 net movers between 2012 and 2022, which is triple the amount gained by Georgia, the number two state. Alabama, Florida and Tennessee round out the top five. 
Mississippi netted the most residents from Louisiana, followed by Illinois, New York, California and Michigan – all states that, like Mississippi, have suffered from domestic net outmigration. 

Jump to the top.

Is the problem that too many Mississippians leave or too few people move in? 
Both, but, on balance, Mississippi does a worse job of attracting new residents than retaining current residents. For every 100 people alive today who were born in Mississippi, 36 now live in another state. Mississippi’s retention rate ranks in the middle nationally, 28th out of 50, but it is lowest in the Southeast, where people are less likely to leave their home state than in other regions. 
However, for every 100 people born in Mississippi, only 24 people move in from other states. Another two move in from abroad. The in-migration rate ranks 46th in the country.
The population of people alive today who were born in Mississippi is 3.27 million, 10% larger than the state’s current population. Louisiana is the only other Southern state that is home to fewer people than were born in the state.

How does Mississippi compare to other states? 
Mississippi ranks near the bottom nationally on brain drain, net migration and population change. 
Net migration of four-year college graduates, ages 22 to 50: 47th
Total net migration since 2010: 45th
Population change since 2010: 48th
Louisiana is the only other state in the country to rank 45th or worse in all three categories. It makes sense that Mississippi would be in league with its neighbor to the southwest, but Louisiana also has unique economic and ecological challenges. Within the Southeastern region, Mississippi and Louisiana are extreme outliers. 
The South is the country’s fastest-growing region, and every other state in the region has experienced net in-migration, brain gain and population growth. This includes Arkansas and Alabama, the two states that are most similar to Mississippi in economics, geography and history. Arkansas and Alabama are growing slowly by regional standards, but they sit around the midpoint in national rankings.

Arkansas and Alabama share many of the characteristics that are blamed for Mississippi’s brain drain. They are both poorer and less-educated than the Southern average, and they get labeled with many of the same negative stereotypes. They are the South’s most rural states behind Mississippi, and they do not have a major urban magnet like Dallas, Atlanta or Nashville. Yet Arkansas and Alabama have steadily grown their population by attracting and retaining residents, including university graduates. Since 2020, both have seen a surge of newcomers.

What is the economic cost of the brain drain?
Mississippi’s state economist published a study in 2022 that estimated that the brain drain of university graduates costs the state’s economy an average of $181 million per year. The model was based on retaining 1,200 more four-year graduates per year from 2023-2032 earning an average of $36,569. The study only calculated the additional economic benefits on a yearly basis, but we can extend it over the entire decade. If Mississippi retained 1,200 additional graduates per year for 10 years, and they all stayed in the state so that the state’s population with a bachelor’s degree increased by 12,000 by the end of the decade, then the state economy would grow by a total of $8 billion. (The impact grows exponentially, as previous cohorts continue to receive a paycheck, combined with the additional earnings from each year’s new influx of graduates.) An extra $8 billion would double Mississippi’s economic growth rate from the most recent decade. Those gains would also benefit workers without a degree: the state economist’s model predicts that the 1,200 additional four-year graduates would create almost 1,200 jobs elsewhere in the economy. 
For a real-world example of how this could play out, compare Mississippi’s economy to Arkansas’ economy. In 2010, Mississippi and Arkansas were roughly equal in population and economic output. Mississippi had 45,000 more people and its GDP was $7 billion smaller. Between 2010 and 2024, Arkansas added 200,000 more residents than Mississippi and attracted 42,000 more four-year graduates. By the end of 2024, Arkansas’s economy was $31 billion larger than Mississippi’s — tripling Mississippi’s growth rate. 

We can also think about the brain drain in terms of a loss on the investment made by taxpayers. State and local taxpayers contribute $8,494 per year toward the education of every public K-12 student and $14,662 for every public university student. These numbers change every year — they’ve risen about 25% since 2000 after accounting for inflation — but, as a crude estimate, a Mississippi student who completes 17 years of education in public schools and universities will receive about $170,000 in direct educational investment from their fellow Mississippians. This doesn’t include other indirect investments that benefit kids as well as adults: infrastructure, healthcare, police, firefighters, etc. 
Mississippi residents pay an average of 9% of their annual income in state and local taxes, which means that a university graduate would need to earn almost $1.9 million in the state simply to repay the up-front investment. At the median income for university graduates, that would take 36 years. The state auditor’s office reported in 2022 that 40% of in-state graduates are not employed within the state within five years of finishing their degree. Since Mississippi only attracts two graduates from other states for every three it loses, a large portion of the state’s education funding turns into a subsidy to other states. As of 2023, the brain drain had cost Mississippi 57,000 four-year graduates between ages 22 to 50 who were born in the state. Collectively, they represent approximately $7 billion in educational expenditures after inflation.

What are the political implications?
Population loss most directly influences political representation through congressional reapportionment, which takes place after the U.S. Census every 10 years. In 2000, Mississippi’s congressional delegation shrunk from five to four because it had grown more slowly than other states. If current trends hold, Mississippi is likely to retain its fourth seat in 2030, but it will be in jeopardy by the time the 2040 Census comes around.  
Population changes have influenced the redrawing of congressional maps within the state. The 2nd District, held by Democrat Bennie Thompson, had to be expanded after the 2020 Census because it lost 9% of its population in the preceding decade. The 2nd District now covers one-third of the state’s land area, and it will continue to grow geographically as long as the Delta region and Hinds County lose population. It’s likely that would mean adding more white voters to the state’s only majority-Black district, which could trigger a Voting Rights Act challenge. It could also alter the demographics of the majority-white 1st or 3rd Districts. 
Similarly, the latest round of legislative redistricting has set off a fierce series of political and legal battles that is still ongoing. After Republican lawmakers approved new district maps on party-line votes, lawsuits brought on behalf of Black voters have forced 15 districts to be redrawn and their seats contested in special elections this year. In general, population changes in recent decades have shifted legislative power away from rural Mississippi and the city of Jackson and toward suburban areas and the Coast. 
As for statewide elections, the effect of population changes exists as a hypothetical: would Mississippi elect different candidates if fewer people were leaving? Since 2010, net domestic outmigration has cost Mississippi at least 100,000 citizens who would have been of voting age by the state elections in 2023. It would not have swung the outcomes of many races, since most of Mississippi’s recent elections have been decided by wide margins. But it could have had an impact on the 2023 race for governor, for instance, which incumbent Republican Tate Reeves won over Democrat Brandon Presley by fewer than 27,000 votes. It’s impossible to say whether an extra 100,000 eligible voters would have swayed the final result, but it’s clear that the political ripple effects will only get larger if Mississippi continues to lose more people.

What causes the brain drain? Is it mostly about jobs?  
People choose where to live based on a variety of individual factors, but every person of working age has to take job opportunities into account. Some people move to maximize their income, some move to get a job they love, and others move to a place they want to live where they can find a job that pays the bills. 
There is no doubt that Mississippi’s economy is a major driver of the brain drain. Jobs often pay less than equivalent positions in other states, even after accounting for cost of living differences. According to the most recent American Community Survey data, Mississippians with bachelor’s degrees earn 23% less than the national average. Mississippians with graduate degrees earn 27% less than their counterparts. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Mississippi’s cost of living is 13% cheaper than the national average.
People born in Mississippi who leave the state are rewarded with higher incomes at every level of education, but moving is especially lucrative for four-year graduates, who make almost $19,000 more than graduates who stay.

Mississippi also has fewer jobs available in fields that require a bachelor’s degree or specialized training. Roughly one-third of Mississippi natives in their 20s and 30s have completed a four-year degree, but Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce estimates that just 24% of jobs in Mississippi meet their qualifications, the lowest in the country. They project that share to stay level through 2031.
In-state job opportunities vary widely according to industry. In general, Mississippians who work in education and healthcare are most likely to stay, while those in STEM fields are the most likely to leave. However, Mississippi attracts fewer workers than it loses in each of the 15 most common professions for people born in the state. Losses are greatest in computer science and IT. For every 10 Mississippi natives currently working in tech, eight have left the state, and only three people have moved in from other places. As a result, the state’s tech workforce is less than half as large as it would have been without the brain drain.

How much is rural depopulation to blame? 
The longstanding migration pattern has been for people to move from rural areas and small towns to big cities and suburban areas. This trend places Mississippi at a structural disadvantage, since Mississippi has the fourth-most rural population in the country and no large metropolitan area.
However, population density does not tell the whole story. Counties in Mississippi have underperformed counties of similar sizes across the board. Between 2010 and 2020, Mississippi counties under 25,000 people lost movers at more than twice the national average, and Mississippi counties between 25,000 and 50,000 people had a net outmigration rate of 6%, compared to flat migration nationally. Mississippi’s larger counties attracted more people than they lost, but at slower rates than peer counties outside the state.

What role do Jackson’s struggles play?
Most states have been able to offset their rural depopulation through the growth of their metropolitan areas. The Jackson region accounts for one-fifth of the state’s population and is Mississippi’s only metro area among the 100 largest in the country (it ranked 95th in 2024, with 606,000 residents). But in contrast with many fast-growing midsized Sunbelt cities, the Jackson area is losing population.
The city of Jackson has lost almost one-third of its population since 1980, with no sign of leveling off. From 2020 to 2024, Jackson lost more than 12,000 residents, the largest per capita drop among the 324 cities with more than 100,000 residents.  

Historically, the surrounding suburbs have absorbed most of Jackson’s outmigration. Since 1980, their population has grown by nearly 80% and the metropolitan area has added 140,000 residents. However, in recent years, the growth in the suburbs has also tapered off. Over the past four years, 14,500 more people have left the Jackson metro area than moved in, the fifth-worst net migration rate of any metro area with at least 500,000 people. From July 2023 to June 2024, the most recent year available, the Jackson region ranked last in the country, losing twice times as many people per capita as any other major metropolitan area.
At the same time, people have flocked to similarly-sized regions in neighboring states. Huntsville, Chattanooga and Northwest Arkansas are growing rapidly by attracting newcomers, including many young professionals who have left expensive coastal cities after the pandemic.

Should we only care about losing college graduates? 
Absolutely not. There is a tendency for people talking about the brain drain to say the state is losing its “best and brightest.” That’s demonstrably false. Many of Mississippi’s most talented and productive people did not have the interest or the opportunity to get a four-year college degree. And it is not desirable for Mississippi to only retain college grads while losing everyone else. Mississippi should create more opportunities for college graduates while also investing in career pathways that do not require a bachelor’s degree. 
There are two reasons why four-year graduates deserve special attention. First, they are the only people who are leaving the state. About 70% of Mississippians with a high school diploma or associate’s degree stay in the state, but only about half of Mississippians with bachelor’s degrees stick around. Furthermore, Mississippi attracts a new resident with a high school or community college education for every one it loses, but only two four-year graduates move in for every three who leave. To solve the problem of outmigration and population loss, we must focus on where the problem lies. 
Second, Mississippi taxpayers invest more in the education of university graduates than people who complete fewer years of schooling, and university graduates have higher average earnings when they enter the workforce. When they leave, it means that the people who received the most benefit from taxpayers, and who would contribute the most in state taxes, do not repay the investment that was made in them. Therefore, Mississippians who received less state funding and who tend to earn lower incomes are forced to shoulder more of the burden for the cost of education, infrastructure and public services.

Does the departure of out-of-state college students add to the brain drain? 
It is a common fallacy that the brain drain is inflated by out-of-state students after they graduate from college in Mississippi. Currently, almost two in five students at Mississippi’s public universities came from outside the state. That’s 31,000 potential graduates who could leave the state within a few years. 
However, they will not add to the state’s brain drain — they will reduce it. Even if the vast majority leave, the few who stay will have a positive effect on the state’s migration rate. Those who leave will have no net effect, since they were counted as newcomers when they arrived in the state. 
It is theoretically possible that out-of-state graduates could distort a single year’s migration data if the number who left after graduation was larger than the number who arrived as freshmen. That is one reason most of the data presented above goes back at least 10 years or more. It is also why we have looked at where people were born, not just where they attended college, when quantifying the net loss of four-year graduates. Then there is the fact that the number of out-of-state students has grown almost every year since 2010. Brain drain is not statistical noise. It is a persistent trend.

What is the role of foreign immigration?
Foreign-born immigrants account for a tiny share of Mississippi’s overall population, but they have helped offset more than one-third of the outmigration of U.S.-born residents from the state since 2010. In that period, Mississippi has added approximately 41,000 new residents from overseas while losing 120,000 people born in the country. The state’s immigrant population has more than doubled over that time, yet Mississippi’s international immigration rate still ranks fourth-lowest in the country.
In total, 2.5% of Mississippi’s population — about 75,000 people — were born outside the U.S., the third-lowest share in the country. To put it in perspective, the city of Memphis (population 618,000) has roughly the same number of immigrants as the entire state of Mississippi. Arkansas’s foreign-born population is more than twice as large as Mississippi’s.
About half of Mississippi’s immigrants have come from Latin America, one-third from Asia, and one-tenth from Europe. Immigrants in Mississippi are more likely to be naturalized citizens than undocumented. They are also more likely to hold a four-year degree than the U.S.-born population, and they are twice as likely to start their own business. 
However, the Trump Administration’s efforts to curtail immigration will likely reduce the number of people moving to Mississippi from other countries. That will send Mississippi’s population into faster decline and increase the importance of stopping Mississippi’s domestic brain drain.

Where are the bright spots? 
Despite Mississippi’s challenges, there are reasons for optimism. 
First, Mississippi has always been a wellspring of talent, and thanks to improvements in the state’s education system, it is being developed better than ever. In recent years, the “Mississippi Miracle” in elementary reading scores has garnered widespread attention from the press and policymakers. Less heralded, but equally important, are the strides made by the state’s institutions of higher learning. In 2020, Mississippi’s colleges and universities ranked 29th nationally in the number of bachelor’s degrees granted per capita — second-most in the South, behind only Alabama. Mississippi made the highest jump of any state in the country over the preceding decade: up 14 spots, from 43rd in 2010. This occurred despite a decline in the number of in-state students, a product of falling birth rates and high outmigration among young families. Mississippi’s universities have become magnets for out-of-state students by offering quality academic programs, vibrant campus life and affordable tuition. They have proven that people are willing to move to Mississippi, and businesses and policymakers should work hard to keep them. 
Second, Mississippi is located in the middle of the fastest-growing region in the country, and it has many of the same assets as other Southern states that are drawing people from around the country. Chief among them is affordable housing. Mississippi has the second-lowest home prices in the country, according to Zillow. As Sunbelt metropolises like Atlanta and Austin have swelled with newcomers, their housing costs have surged. The pandemic accelerated migration away from expensive urban areas toward midsized cities, suburbs, and college towns where each dollar goes farther. As long as these trends continue, many communities in Mississippi have the opportunity to become attractive destinations for newcomers and returning expats. 
A third advantage is the enduring attachment that Mississippians carry with them, even if they have lived outside the state longer than they lived in it. More than 1 million people born in Mississippi now live in other states, often within a few hours of home. If just 1% moved back each year, the state could reverse its net outmigration from the past decade. Many already entertain the prospect of moving back someday, as evidenced by the numbers who return in retirement. They could be drawn back earlier if they felt assured that they would not have to sacrifice their careers or quality of life to do so. If they see signs of progress, the desire to contribute to the state they love will be a powerful force calling them home.

Where does all of this data come from? 
The Census Bureau provides the most comprehensive data on migration and population change. The Census Bureau publishes annual state and local population estimates, covering the 12 months from July 1 to June 30 each year. The most recent estimates are from 2024 (July 1, 2023-June 30, 2024). The state population changes include annual estimates of births, deaths, domestic migration, and international migration.
The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) collects data each year on a variety of social and economic characteristics from a representative sample of Americans. The ACS data provides detailed demographic information about people who have moved into and out of Mississippi. 
The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), housed at the University of Minnesota, allows for customized analysis of Census data to look at, for example, the age and education level of Mississippi natives who now live in another state. The University of Wisconsin’s Applied Population Laboratory also provides detailed county-level demographic breakouts of net migration patterns from 1950 to 2020.
The IRS releases statistics on tax filers who have moved between states each year. The tax data includes the age range and income earned in the year of the move. It does not rely on modeling, thus it is more precise than Census estimates (in fact, the Census estimates are partially based on IRS data), but it excludes people who did not file a tax return. 
On the state level, Mississippi’s Longitudinal Data System connects administrative data from the state’s public K-12 schools, community colleges, and universities with employment data from the Mississippi Department of Economic Security. It does not track people who leave the state, but it does record the share of graduates who are employed in Mississippi. 
There are other experimental sources that provide specialized data. For example, recent migration studies have cited LinkedIn profiles, U.S. Postal Service change-of-address requests, and credit reports. Moving companies and real estate firms also periodically publish data on customers that have made interstate moves. Analytics firms like Placer.AI sell proprietary tools that estimate migration using large consumer datasets, for example cell phone locations.

What can we do to stop the brain drain?
The available data give us a good indication of how many people are leaving, who they are, and where they are going. They do not, however, tell us why, or what we can do about it. To answer that question, we need your help.
Mississippi Today, the University of Mississippi’s Center for Population Studies, and Working Together Mississippi’s Rethink Mississippi initiative have partnered to create a survey to identify the most important things people look for when they choose where to live — whether that’s in Mississippi or somewhere else. The survey is open to anyone over 18, no matter where you’re from or where you live now. Once we know the factors that people consider when leaving or staying, we can develop strategies to help Mississippi compete with other places. If you have good ideas, the survey also gives you the opportunity to share them.
Once we have received enough responses, we will publish the results of the survey. They will inform Mississippi Today’s ongoing reporting on the causes, consequences and solutions to Mississippi’s brain drain crisis.

Construction at the intersection is part of a $14.7 million project to widen the section of the turnpike between Eastern Avenue and I-35 to six lanes.  
The construction projects are part of ACCESS Oklahoma, a $8.2 billion long-range plan that aims to improve turnpike systems across the state. This plan includes creating interchange access points, widening turnpikes, improving bridges and adding new turnpikes to alleviate congestion.
Shearer-Salim said exit ramp construction was expected to be completed in the middle of August, but the project is “progressing a little bit faster than anticipated,” so the lane closures on I-35 are expected to end by the end of July.

(Photo courtesy of Louisiana National Guard)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced Monday he will name the state’s largest National Guard training site after a little-known early 19th century militiaman and slaveowner, the father of the Confederate general whose name the facility originally carried.
The Louisiana National Guard Training Facility in Pineville will once again be known as Camp Beauregard, which had been its name until 2023 when the state joined a nationwide effort to remove monuments and honorifics to Confederate veterans and leaders.
The site was previously named after Gen. Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, who initiated the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter off South Carolina’s coast to begin the Civil War on April 12, 1861.
It will now be named after Capt. Jacques Toutant Beauregard, a member of the Louisiana Militia who reportedly fought in the 1815 Battle of New Orleans. Jacques Toutant Beauregard is P.G.T. Beauregard’s father, Louisiana National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. Noel Collins confirmed to the Illuminator. 
Landry announced the renaming of the facility with a social media post that included a seemingly AI-generated image of a headstone that reads “Wokeism.”
“By restoring the name Camp Beauregard, we honor a legacy of courage and service that dates back over two centuries,” Landry said in a news release. “Let this also be a lesson that we should always give reverence to history and not be quick to so easily condemn or erase the dead, lest we and our times be judged arbitrary by future generations.”
The governor’s news release does not mention the Beauregards are related to each other.
P.G.T. Beauregard, a native of St. Bernard Parish, was the first Confederate to receive the rank of general after Louisiana seceded from the United States on Jan. 26, 1861 — one month after South Carolina became the first state to secede. He soon took command of Confederate forces in Charleston. The Union surrendered Fort Sumter to him to conclude a bloodless battle that marked the beginning of a four-year war.
Beauregard would later take advantage of the mass pardons for treason offered to former Confederate officers and officials by President Andrew Johnson. The former general was reportedly reluctant to swear an oath of allegiance to the United States but was persuaded to do so by Johnson and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
After his return to Louisiana, P.G.T. Beauregard became a railroad superintendent and argued for Black voting rights in order to remove the radical Republicans who had gained control of state and local government during the Reconstruction period.
According to a Louisiana National Guard news release, Jacques Toutant Beauregard was a member of the Louisiana Militia whose regiment took part in a fight that was a prelude to the Battle of New Orleans.
Jacques Toutant Beauregard was the owner of a sugarcane farm in St. Bernard Parish later named the Contreras Plantation, where P.G.T. Beauregard was born. The Beauregard family owned slaves on the plantation, according to T. Harry Williams’ biography “P.G.T. Beauregard, Napoleon in Gray.”
In the news release, Maj. Gen. Thomas Friloux, adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, praised Jacques Toutant Beauregard as an American hero.
“We’re naming our premier training installation after an American hero and patriot who fought for the freedom of the city of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana, and the United States of America against a foreign invader,” Friloux said.

Across most of the South and Midwest, state laws bar local governments from requiring employers to provide paid sick leave. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Across most of the South and Midwest, state laws bar local governments from requiring employers to provide paid sick leave, effectively stripping cities of the power to enact their own labor protections.
Nearly 73 million workers live in the 18 states, including Oklahoma, that now have such preemptive laws, according to a new report from A Better Balance, a legal advocacy organization focused on workplace rights, and the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.
“Local leaders know what’s best for their communities. To take away the decision-making power from local communities on this issue and others is very, very concerning,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director of the Southern office at A Better Balance, and one of the report’s authors.
Among the 18 states included in the report was Missouri. The legislature passed a measure in May to repeal paid leave requirements voters had approved in November that expanded access to paid sick leave for about 728,000 workers who lacked it. Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe on Thursday signed the statewide repeal into law. Local paid sick leave laws have been banned in Missouri since 2017.
Kehoe in a statement called the paid sick leave mandates “onerous,” saying they dictated when and how sick leave was provided and had “burdensome” recordkeeping and compliance obligations.
Nationwide, about 27 million workers don’t earn paid sick days, the report found. Many of them work low-wage and part-time jobs, and they’re disproportionately likely to be women, younger workers and people of color, according to the report.
“Folks are facing impossible choices between their own health — or the health of their children — and continuing to earn a paycheck to pay bills and put food on the table,” Freeland told Stateline.
In the absence of federal laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers, more cities and local governments have passed their own, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Seattle.
But lawmakers in 18 states, mainly in the South and Midwest, have done the opposite, the report found. GOP legislators have said such paid leave requirements create financial hardship for employers, particularly for smaller businesses.
Over the past decade, in GOP-led states across the country, Republican lawmakers have tried to limit the policymaking power of Democratic-led urban centers on issues ranging from immigration to voting rights to LGBTQ+ matters.
While all of the states that preempt local paid sick leave laws are Republican-led, many conservative-led states in the Mountain West don’t have such laws.
Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership and another author of the report, said that’s because Western states tend to have more of a libertarian bent. And she said preemption laws in the South have their roots in historically racist standards that undervalue Black workers.
More than half the Black labor force — 56% — lives in one of the 18 states that prohibit local paid sick time protections, the report said.
Freeland also pointed out that the paid sick leave issue impacts not just urban centers, but rural communities as well. Many people without paid sick leave work in physically demanding jobs such as manufacturing and farming.
The report’s authors say that paid sick leave laws can help reduce the spread of illness, increase employment and wages, particularly for women with child care responsibilities, and can help recruit and retain workers.

Ned Lamont was blunt: “I just don’t know if I can count on [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] right now.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) echoed that sentiment Monday at a Hartford press conference.
“They’re hollowing [FEMA] out,” Blumenthal said of the Trump administration. “They’re destroying it.”
Blumenthal is calling for an investigation into FEMA’s response to this month’s deadly flooding in Texas, which he says was “inadequate.” He wants the investigation to also cover what dramatic drops in staffing and other cuts will mean for the agency’s ability to respond to future disasters around the country.
“It’s not reform, it’s demolition that we’re seeing. That will impact Connecticut, because response times will be much slower, funds will be lacking, support simply will be absent,” Blumenthal said. “The faults and failings that we’ve seen, apparently, in Texas will be magnified here in Connecticut as the ramifications of these cuts and delays are seen in even bigger magnitude.”
FEMA’s impact on CT communities
Blumenthal praised last year’s FEMA response to major flooding in Connecticut as an example of what the agency can and should do after an emergency.
“FEMA was on the site literally within hours or days, and helped immeasurably,” Blumenthal said. “Those communities are back on their feet. Businesses are back in business because FEMA was there.”
[RELATED from 2024: For CT residents, businesses, help after August floods is available]
Moving forward, he said, “I think we ought to be deeply concerned that we may see lapses here in Connecticut.”
Blumenthal also criticized FEMA’s cancellation of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, grant program, which he said has stripped $50 million from Connecticut projects.
“This kind of cancellation is cruel and it’s dumb,” Blumenthal said. “It is literally counterproductive and more costly to cancel grants for resilience and prevention of damage due to weather disasters, because ultimately the cost will be higher in having to repair.”
Blumenthal was joined at the press conference by Meriden Mayor Kevin Scarpati, whose city has been impacted by the grant cancellation, with funding stripped in the middle of an $11.1 million project meant to reduce flooding risk along Harbor Brook.
“If these funds aren’t here for us to utilize, it’s going to be on the backs of our taxpayers who are already strained coming into this budget cycle to finish this project,” Scarpati said. “Let alone the two or three other projects we’ve got lined up in tandem to make the downtown area of the city of Meriden safer, more resilient, and get dozens of properties out of the 100-year flood plain.”

Logan Manhart, R-Aberdeen, speaks in the South Dakota House of Representatives on Feb. 21, 2025, at the state Capitol in Pierre. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Usually South Dakota has its political controversies during the legislative session or an election campaign. This year, in the dead of summer, we have a state representative’s use of the term “White Boy Summer.”
It was used in an Instagram post by Rep. Logan Manhart, a District 1 Republican from Aberdeen: “It’s White Boy Summer and the boys are back in charge.” He wrote that, along with “#MAGA.” 
I don’t use Instagram or hashtags. It seems to me that Instagram and some other social media sites are places online where people post things that they later come to regret. Manhart has since removed the Instagram post. 
My ignorance of Instagram and hashtags aside, there are some things that I do know. In this day and age, I know that using the phrase “White Boy” is just asking for trouble. It’s particularly troublesome if it’s a phrase used by a state representative. It’s even more troublesome if it’s used by a representative whose district includes the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation. 
Republican South Dakota lawmaker removes ‘white boy summer’ social media post after criticism

I’ve come to learn that the phrase is part of a rap song by Chet Hanks. (Tom Hanks’ son is a rapper?) It was written as a parody of a song called “Hot Girl Summer” by rapper Megan Thee Stallion. (I need to get out more.)
Apparently the song by Hanks has been appropriated by various racist extremist groups. (Those groups have theme songs now?)
The song’s popularity with extremist groups was enough to get Democratic members of the House involved. It’s easy to get them incensed as there are so few of them. Five members signed a letter to House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach and House Speaker Jon Hansen asking them to “address this with the seriousness it demands.”
In their letter they said Manhart’s post was racist, sexist and insulting to Native Americans. Democrats noted that the state’s Native American land was “taken through broken treaties, displacement, and violence.”
Odenbach, a Republican, said he wouldn’t punish Manhart, and he rejected the “insinuation that South Dakota is a state founded by racist oppressors, or that the great citizens of today are the cause” of continued harm to Native Americans. 
To a certain extent, Odenbach is right. Today’s South Dakotans didn’t break any treaties, they didn’t lead any raiding parties, they didn’t push Native Americans on to reservations. But someone did. Odenbach’s notion that our forefathers were squeaky clean in this regard is a whitewashing of South Dakota history.
There’s plenty of blame to go around for the way Native Americans are treated in this state, and it’s Odenbach and his political party that must shoulder some of that blame. The South Dakota Legislature, dominated by Republicans, pays woefully little attention to Native American issues, preferring to think of those as federal rather than state problems. This amounts to the Legislature, sworn to serve all South Dakotans, turning its back on a group because of their heritage.  
Americans have the First Amendment, so Manhart can say what he wants. It’s impossible to know what’s in his heart. Even though he has been unrepentant, he said characterizations of him as racist, sexist and antisemitic are false. 
Like all political controversies, this one will peter out after a while. When the dust settles, Manhart will still be a representative. Democrats will continue to monitor his public statements. Republicans will maintain that everything in South Dakota is fine. And Native Americans will continue to be largely ignored by the state government sworn to serve them.

(Photo by TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)Cancer is a cruel disease.
Unfortunately, too many Pennsylvanians already know this. Approximately 89,000 of our family, friends and neighbors were diagnosed with cancer last year and 27,570 of them are expected to lose their battle, according to the American Cancer Society.
The only silver lining: investments in scientific research are making earlier cancer detection and improved treatment possible and have led to a 33% reduction in America’s cancer death rate over the last three decades.
Unfortunately, the proposed federal budget for next year includes a 55% cut to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and a 44% cut to National Institutes of Health (NIH).
If these cuts are supported by Congress, our chances of developing cures for cancer, the number two cause of death in Pennsylvania, will be dramatically reduced.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
I am honored and fortunate that my job, supported by NSF and NIH funding, includes researching new ways to fight cancer. As a physicist who studies biology, my team of graduate students and I use mathematical equations and computer simulations to understand why tumors metastasize, or spread throughout the body. This research helps other scientists we work with design and interpret their experiments. Our work is critical because we know cancer deaths are caused by cells metastasizing, not from the existence of tumors.
We also investigate how tumors interact with other parts of the body, including the bacteria that live naturally within us. Ten years ago, the scientific community didn’t know that bacteria and tumors can co-exist. Now many researchers are asking how we can use bacteria to help deliver cancer drugs.
With this progress and potential, we have an opportunity to increase survival rates for cancer patients and cannot rest until cancer can be mitigated. This will be a long road – full of challenges and curve balls. However, the work to protect cancer patients must continue, and the Keystone State can play a key role.
The proposed budget cuts to science will devastate cancer research because curing cancer is going to take time, coordinated scientific research in Pennsylvania and across the country – and, most importantly, money.
Why should preventing funding cuts matter for Pennsylvanians?
Because the NIH’s National Cancer Institute is the world’s largest funder of cancer research.
In addition, NSF funding helps scientists like me and my team to focus on scientific research. And we’re not the only ones. Across Pennsylvania, NSF funding in 2023 supported hundreds of scientists across multiple scientific fields of study.
And, because their research is done here in the commonwealth, that funding is directly injected back into our local economies. These student scientists spend their salaries getting haircuts at local salons, eating at local restaurants, and buying groceries at local markets.

These investments are funding our future – many of my students go on to U.S. technology, pharmaceutical and biomedical companies where they can make future scientific breakthroughs.
If federal funding of scientific research is cut, these students and their research go away. We lose the discoveries they create and the public health and economic benefits that go along with them for decades to come.
No country is better at fighting cancer and funding the research required to do so. If we abandon our place as the global leader in the fight to end cancer, Americans will have to wait for cutting-edge cancer treatments. Funding cuts force the best researchers to leave the country or never to come at all.
Pennsylvania, with our world-class research facilities, hospital systems, and laboratories, is an important part of America’s scientific ecosystem. As lawmakers hash out the next federal budget, I hope there is recognition that without this funding, progress toward curing cancer for all Pennsylvanians will stall, and Pennsylvanians will continue to lose their lives to a disease we have the tools and knowledge to fight, if only we invest in them.

(Screencap)Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey joined 23 states and the District of Columbia Monday in filing suit against President Donald Trump’s administration over $6.8 billion in unexpectedly frozen funds for education initiatives like summer programming and adult learning.
The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Management and Budget and President Donald Trump. The complaint is the first legal response to a June 30 email memo sent from the U.S. Department of Education to education departments nationwide detailing the abrupt suspension of billions in federal education grants.
A quarter of the grant money typically arrives in state education coffers on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, so local education departments can plan for the year ahead. But the expected payments were paused on June 30, the last day of fiscal year 2025. The maneuver’s timing leaves state-level education officials in precarious positions as they plan for the year ahead, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha suggested during a virtual press conference Monday with the Attorneys General of California, Colorado, and Massachusetts, who co-lead the lawsuit.
“It is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year…when the president takes the football away from us like Lucy in a Charlie Brown cartoon,” Neronha said.
The funds supported after-school and summertime programming for kids, as well as adult education, and teacher training. In states like Massachusetts, the grants also subsidized education for children of migrant workers.
Rhode Island would lose an estimated $29 million in federal funds. Across New England, Massachusetts would see a loss of over $100 million, and Connecticut would receive $50 million less. Vermont and Maine would lose $25 million each. New Hampshire, which would also see a $25 million loss of grant funding, is the only New England state not listed as a plaintiff in the suit.
The grants now depend on a review meant to ascertain whether “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” according to the three-sentence email from the education department sentJune 30.
The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A July 9 statement Office of Management and Budget  shared with Rhode Island Current noted that the funds were paused after some school districts had allegedly used previous grant money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.”
The attorneys general argue that the funding freeze violates an assortment of federal laws and constitutional principles — both recurring themes in the arguments they made in dozens of similar multi-state lawsuits brought to court since Trump took office in January.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who hosted the press conference, described the lawsuit as the latest defensive move against what he called the Trump administration’s “little regard for the law.”
“In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks, eight of them challenge unlawful attacks on education,” Bonta said.
The coalition of attorneys general wants a federal judge to rule that the funding freeze is illegal, as well as order the federal government to release the money. A pair of court filings seeking both outcomes comprises over 180 pages, and describe the freeze as “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional.”
Neronha told reporters that, in Rhode Island’s case, the funding freeze comes at an especially inopportune time, with the state’s part-time legislature having just wrapped up its legislative session three weeks prior.
“It was a very difficult budget year,” Neronha said, with lawmakers forced to make tough fiscal decisions amid the state’s many money troubles, including an ailing health care infrastructure.
But the AG said he hoped that the issue would be resolved “far, far, far before” legislators return for a new legislative session in January.
Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green previously denounced the funding freeze at a July 9 press conference. In a Monday statement, Infante-Green again decried the funding stoppage as one that “harms Rhode Island’s students, families, and teachers.” The $29 million loss of Congressionally approved aid means “there will be cuts” to before- and after-school programs, STEM learning, multilingual education, and professional development for teachers, Infante-Green said.
“Rhode Island students have been making significant strides in education progress, post-pandemic,” Infante-Green wrote in her statement. “Delays and cuts in federal funds put progress and momentum in every district in Rhode Island at risk. RIDE is working closely with education leaders across the state, and across the country, doing everything we can to protect our students and limit disruptions to their learning.“
Taking legal action against the Trump administration is now routine for Neronha’s office. His office’s  website has tallied its salvoes against the Trump administration since March 13. Thus far, Neronha has co-led or joined 26 lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Asked by reporters about the likelihood of success in the present funding case, Neronha declined to predict an outcome.
“I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves and I don’t obviously want to speak for the court,” he said. “We have to make our points there as well. But based on the track record…we’ve seen this story before. We’ve been in the ring before with these sorts of cases and we’ve had great success because the violations of the law are so obvious.”

Many questions will be asked––one of which will be: why were thousands of Palestinian people allowed to die from starvation and genocide? How did the international community fail these people?
In November 2023, I wrote an opinion piece: “In Search of Moral Clarity in the Middle East,” in response to what I thought was some moral confusion. I feel the need to write again in response to the opinion piece: “Nonsense and falsity from ‘pro Palestinian’ groups,” published on June 23.
In April 1994, Rwanda remembered 30 years since the genocide there which killed more than 800,000 people. During this commemoration, Rwandan leaders called out the failure of the international community for not intervening to stop it. It seems that the same is happening now. To date, more than 55,000 people have been killed and a recent BBC report states that: “Gaza’s population of around 2.1 million Palestinians is at “critical risk” of famine and faces “extreme levels of food insecurity” as an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid continues.” 
As I write, Israeli forces continue to kill Palestinians and all humanitarian aid from the UN and other credible humanitarian organizations has been blocked. Instead, an Israel-US created group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation comprising American security contractors and ex-military officers is supposedly delivering aid. Media reports show much chaos, desperate people in need of aid getting shot at, some killed, including children and the violation of humanitarian principles such as humanity, neutrality, and impartiality.
Pro-Palestinian protestors are protesting against the genocide and intentional starvation of Palestinian people. This is not nonsense or false. Pro-Palestinian protestors are protesting against the unabating financial and military support by the the U.S. Government to the Israeli government for decades. This is also not nonsense or false. Being in solidarity with Palestinian children, women, and men does not equal condoning the actions by Hamas.
The Jewish people, just like the Palestinian people, have a right to exist; they also, just like the Palestinian people also have a right to a land,  but (some) Jewish people do not have the right to obliterate a population. I know that many Jewish people are also against what the Israeli government is doing and have done for decades.
The situation in Israel and Palestine is complex––too complex and lengthy for an opinion piece like this to do it justice. However, what can be said is that October 7, 2023 did not mark the beginning of this war. The beginning took place in 1917 with the Balfour Declaration when the British government which controlled Palestine at the time, gave Jewish people the right to immigrate and take land traditionally held by Palestinians. Historians have questioned the legitimacy behind Britain’s actions. Something could be said about the right of any country to claim sovereignty of another country and decide its fate.
Palestinians have been subjugated and oppressed in their own land for several decades now. Israel has maintained an apartheid system over Palestine. The word ‘apartheid’ originates from the Afrikaans meaning ‘apartness’ and was used to describe the repressive political system for the nonwhite majority that South Africa maintained from 1948 to 1994. The Black South African population experienced racial segregation, oppression and were denied basic rights and freedoms.  Similarly, Palestinians have been submitted to an apartheid state by Israel for many years.  
An apartheid state is a violation of international law and is considered a crime against humanity. The International Court of Justice has recently issued arrest warrants for  Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant and a military commander of Hamas (who, it has been claimed was killed during an Israeli strike) with war crimes and crimes against humanity.
While I think it’s important to give visibility to those who died or are still held as hostages taken during the attack by Hamas by stating their names, if I was to attempt note the names of all the Gazans and others  who have died as a result of Israeli forces, I wouldn’t be able to do it––we know some of their names but not all of them. There are just too many to name but also because their lives are deemed un-grievable. This is a moral failing. Thousands of Palestinians also remain detained; most of them without due process.
The number of pro-Palestinian solidarity groups that have surged around the world since October 7, 2023 is testament to an increasing understanding and awareness of the situation in the occupied territories. These groups should be lauded rather than denounced for finally helping to make the plight of Palestinians visible. 
Solidarity with the Palestinian children, women, and men must not stop now.

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)Democrat Mary Peltola, who was Alaska’s sole member of the U.S. House, lost her reelection bid last year.
But her margin of defeat of less than 3 percentage points, in a state that Donald Trump won by double-digits, showed that Peltola remains a formidable candidate.
And that means “every national Democrat is salivating” at the idea that Peltola could challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan next year, said Jim Lottsfeldt, a longtime Anchorage political consultant.
“I’ve been asked by some famous ones, by some less famous ones, ‘What can you do to convince her?’” Lottsfeldt said.
But many Democrats inside Alaska see Peltola as the party’s strongest candidate for governor next year, when Republican incumbent Mike Dunleavy is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. And they’re waiting to see which race she enters.
“If she chooses to run for either U.S. House or U.S. Senate, I will absolutely run for governor,” said Tom Begich, the Democratic former state senator from Anchorage. “If she doesn’t choose to do that, but chooses to run for governor, then I’ll be supporting her.”
As for the potential candidate herself? 
She’s biding her time.
Peltola, who declined to comment, earlier this year took a job with a national law and lobbying firm, Holland & Hart, where she works with her former chief of staff, Anton McParland. 
Peltola has not made up her mind about whether to run for governor, U.S. Senate or U.S. House, said Elisa Rios, a former campaign manager for Peltola who still speaks with her regularly.
“It’s really just where she can make the greatest impact for Alaskans,” Rios said. “She is going to make that decision on her own time.”
While some operatives and prospective candidates may be impatient for Peltola to make up her mind, the filing deadline for the 2026 elections isn’t until June 1. And she can afford to wait, said Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, the state’s largest organized labor group. 
One poll earlier this year found that Peltola had higher favorability ratings than all three members of the Alaska congressional delegation, as well as Dunleavy.
“She’s Mary Peltola — she has 100% name ID, and she will raise money,” Hall said. “Is waiting, in any way, a problem for Mary? Absolutely not. She can decide on her own terms.”
Alaskans elected Peltola to the U.S. House two times, in quick succession, in special and regular elections in 2022 after the death of Republican Don Young, who held the seat for a half-century.
Peltola, a former member of the Alaska House, defeated Republican former Gov. Sarah Palin in both elections; she quickly became a star in national Democratic circles as the first Alaska Native woman elected to Congress. 
In the U.S. House, Peltola established herself with a brand of centrist politics unique to her state: supporting abortion rights, crusading against factory fishing and salmon bycatch while also endorsing large-scale mining and oil projects. 
 
Mary Peltola ran as pro-fish and anti-bycatch: Here’s what her agenda could look like in Congress

	Her term, however, was marked by the death of her husband Buzzy Peltola, who was killed when the small plane he was piloting crashed in September 2023. 
Mary Peltola ran for re-election last year but lost to Republican Nick Begich III. Begich, a nephew of Tom Begich, won by a final margin of 2.5 percentage points after two other candidates’ support was redistributed in Alaska’s count of ranked choice votes.
Peltola  has largely kept a low profile since her loss. But in recent days, she has emerged publicly. On July 1, the same day Sullivan voted in favor of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Peltola made her first post to social media in nearly five months.
“We can not secure Alaska’s future by increasing healthcare and energy costs for regular Alaskans, so millionaires, like many of my former colleagues in Congress, and their billionaire donors, can get even richer,” Peltola said.
Peltola also served as grand marshal at Anchorage’s Pride parade last month, sporting a rainbow scarf and flag as she told an enthusiastic crowd that it was “so good to be here with all these people who are pro-love.”

Officials with the Senate Democrats’ recruitment and campaigning arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, did not respond to requests for comment. 
But Jessica Taylor, who tracks U.S. Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said that if Peltola decides to challenge Sullivan, she would “put that seat into play.”
“I think Sullivan would certainly not want to run against her, because she’s won statewide before,” Taylor said.
A spokesman for Sullivan’s campaign declined to comment.
Winning a U.S. Senate race would net Peltola a six-year term — two more years than she’d get by winning a gubernatorial race. 
She has also proven to be a formidable fundraiser in federal elections, bringing in more than $12 million total for her campaign in 2023 and 2024.
But political observers say there are also reasons that a U.S. Senate campaign might be less attractive for Peltola. 
If elected, she’d have to resume a 3,300-mile commute to Washington. She’d likely face millions of dollars in attack ads from conservative groups.
A U.S. Senate campaign could also complicate her job at Holland & Hart, the law and lobbying firm.
While Peltola is barred from lobbying Congress for a year after leaving office, the firm, whose clients include oil and gas companies, mining businesses and pharmaceutical giant Bayer, does have contact with members of Congress. 
That includes Sullivan, who Peltola would be running against. McParland, Peltola’s former chief of staff, has visited Sullivan’s office in his new role at the law firm, according to a person with knowledge of the visit.
In a bid for governor, meanwhile, Peltola would not have to face an incumbent. Of the multiple Republicans who have announced campaigns so far, only Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom has held statewide office.
“When she enters, it’s going to be Snow White versus the seven dwarfs,” said Lottsfeldt, the consultant. “The governor’s race is just wide open for her.”
Lottsfeldt, citing the state’s economic woes, said he wants Peltola to run for governor — even though he often earns substantial sums as a local consultant for national Democratic groups when high-profile candidates like her run for congressional races.
“It would be a crazy amount of money. And, you know, I suspect I would do very well — you can quote me,” he said. “But I live in Alaska. The state is failing. The need for a governor is our highest priority right now. And so we have to focus on that.”

AFTER 10 YEARS of state oversight, Holyoke schools are in the process of exiting state receivership. One of three districts placed into state receivership under a 2010 law, with officials at the time citing a long stretch of poor student performance and struggling leadership, Holyoke is the first to be returned to a semblance of local control. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas joins reporter Jennifer Smith to trace the last decade and change in state takeovers of local school districts. Touted for years as a way to wrestle underperforming districts onto a path to improvement, receivership’s results, as Jonas has reported, are a far cry from a silver-bullet fix. 
“This is sort of a super-powered authority of the state coming into a local school district and usurping the power of local officials to run the schools,” Jonas explained. “Now, that can be a bad thing from a local official’s view, or, in the state’s view, a sort of last-ditch necessary move for schools that have been struggling for some time.” 
Receivership powers were part of an education reform package passed in 2010, and they have become one of the major flashpoints in debates over the effectiveness of ed reform policies.  
Defenders of the receivership law continued to argue in recent years that the option of state control was a powerful accountability tool. Opponents of the receivership option, teachers unions most prominently, contend that not only has research found receivership to be dubiously connected to improvement but that it can also be a tool for weakening unions. 
Researcher Beth Schueler, examining state takeovers broadly and Massachusetts takeovers specifically over the past few years, found no clear evidence that such takeovers improve academic outcomes. But there is some evidence, she found, that the subset of takeovers that involve a role for local decision makers, including the ongoing state control of the schools in Lawrence, may produce better results.  
Local officials themselves are mixed on the decision to place schools into receivership, even as they cheer Holyoke’s exit, Jonas reports. Long-time boosters of education reform are also increasingly pointing to the broader set of social determinants that play a crucial role in educational outcomes, like secure housing and health care access. 
Paul Reville, who authored the 2010 reform law as state education secretary under Gov. Deval Patrick, “is still defending it, but is quick to say any idea that this alone would be the key to getting Holyoke students fully on track or students performing on levels like those in more affluent districts is just not the case,” Jonas noted. 
Jonas and Smith discuss the case for Holyoke receivership in 2015 (5:00), the mixed bag of results when states take over school districts (12:15), and the fights to come (25:30).

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida asked Monday to join a lawsuit to stop the further construction and operation of the state-run immigrant detention center in the Everglades.
Tribal leaders had already denounced the detention center, but the motion to intervene in the suit against federal, state, and local officials, which environmental groups filed, adds to the legal opposition to the facility.
All of the tribe’s active ceremonial sites and 15 villages are located within the Big Cypress National Preserve, which surrounds the detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. The tribe wants to protect its members’ homes and ability to conduct ceremonies, hunt, and fish, the filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida states.

“The construction and operation of a detention facility without necessary environmental studies potentially poses a substantial threat to the rights and interests of the Tribe and the livelihood of Tribal members who live adjacent thereto,” wrote the attorneys representing the Miccosukee Tribe.
“Additionally, the unknown environmental impacts of the detention facility’s construction and operation may affect the number and quality of game and/or fish stocks such that Tribe’s traditional rights — guaranteed by federal and state law — are rendered meaningless.”
Two environmental groups, Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, brought the suit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Florida Division of Emergency Management, and Miami-Dade County on June 27. They allege construction of the detention center violates a federal law that requires environmental analysis of potential harms and that the public did not get an opportunity to comment.
So far, U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez hasn’t taken action on the temporary restraining order the environmental groups seek. They filed another motion asking the judge to rule by Friday after he didn’t order construction to stop before immigrants awaiting deportation arrived at the detention center on July 2.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has dismissed the concerns environmental groups are raising as illegitimate, saying they just want to stop deportations. At the same time, the federal government is skirting responsibility for the detention center in its attempt to ward off the lawsuit.
DHS neither funded nor authorized the tent and trailer detention center, counsel for the department wrote in a filing opposing environmental groups’ request that the court halt the site.
A result other than stopping the construction and operation of the detention center would be unacceptable to the tribe.
The filing in federal court also details how the detention center, which Florida Republicans are calling “Alligator Alcatraz” and raising campaign cash by hawking related merchandise, is disrupting nearby villages. One of the villages, the Panther-Osceola Camp, is approximately 1,000 feet from the boundary of the detention center.
“At present, residents report that ingress and egress to their village have been impacted by increased traffic flow along US-41. Further, given the village’s proximity to the facility, residents are concerned about impacts to their freedom to hunt and fish in the immediate area adjacent to a securitized federal detention and immigration facility, as well as the possibility of a facility escape posing a security risk for their community,” the filing to the court states.

One of the primary drinking water sources for the region, the river has high nitrate levels that have led to water restrictions for some 600,000 customers. (Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Cities, states say they’ll need more help to replace millions of lead pipes

Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
 The role of agriculture

As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.


Central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels.


Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
‘Time for a reckoning.’ Kansas farmers brace for water cuts to save Ogallala Aquifer

In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
 Citizen action

The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walton League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.










I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.


– Northeast Iowa retired science teacher Birgitta Meade


While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
 Small towns struggle

Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa)A Minnesota funeral home operator has been fined $1,000 for doing business in Iowa without a license for 12 years.
According to the Iowa Board of Mortuary Science, Daniel Dingmann, who operates a funeral home in southern Minnesota, became an Iowa-licensed funeral director in 1998.
From 1998 to 2012, Dingmann completed the yearly renewal of his Iowa license via regular mail. According to state records, the license became inactive after 2012 — possibly because Dingmann stopped receiving license-renewal notices as the board transitioned to an electronic application process.
In late 2023, Dingmann realized his Iowa license was inactive and inquired with the board as to the renewal process. The board staff instructed him to go online and set up an account, which he attempted to do but without success because of technical issues. Even with assistance from the board staff, Dingmann was unable to successfully establish an online account in order to renew his license.
As a result, he eventually submitted a paper copy of a renewal form along with a check to pay for a new license. The board then notified Dingmann it would be imposing a $1,000 civil penalty against him for handling Iowa funeral services without a license. Dingmann objected, noting that it was he who brought the issue to the board’s attention that he had subsequently tried to reactivate his license with no success.
In May 2025, after the dispute had already gone to a hearing before an administrative law judge, the board moved to drop prosecution of the matter in favor of a dismissal that would still involve a $1,000 civil penalty.  Administrative Law Judge Laura Lockard rejected the deal, noting that it amounted to a settlement agreement rather than a dismissal and that only the board itself, rather than an administrative law judge, could legally approve such an agreement.
As a result, the board’s motion to dismiss the case was denied, and Lockard approved the $1,000 civil penalty. In doing so, she noted that there had been no complaints regarding Dingmann’s work in Iowa, nor any evidence of any harm to the public, or any evidence of action taken against his license in other states.

When thimble-sized mussels were first detected last year in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, biologists quickly rang the alarm over how severely this invasive species could threaten the state’s water supply systems. 
Now, nine months after the mollusks’ appearance near Stockton, officials are in a race to rein in golden mussels as their larvae spread through the state’s network of pumps, pipes and canals, reports CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
Native to China and Southeast Asia, these freshwater mussels can attach themselves to underwater surfaces and form “reefs” that can grow as fast as 150 miles a year. The mollusks have already infiltrated California’s two major water systems that send Delta water south to 30 million people and millions of acres of farmland.
To curb their spread, some water managers are requiring inspections that include quarantining and decontaminating boats before they can enter certain lakes and reservoirs. California’s fish and wildlife agency also has a handful of dogs trained to detect the mollusk.
But the wildlife department is understaffed, and the recently passed state budget includes no funding to combat the mussels. Oversight is also patchy, leaving many lakes with no protection. The federally-managed Shasta Lake, for example, is the biggest reservoir in the state and frequented by boaters — but it does not have a mandatory inspection program.

In other environmental news: To save an estimated $499 billion within the next decade, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping budget bill earlier this month that included changes to federal tax incentives that could dampen California’s clean-energy ambitions.
As CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo explains, developers of wind and solar projects now face a shorter deadline for securing tax credits, and companies that rely on China for machine parts are barred from accessing the credits. In the face of these new rules, nearly a dozen solar projects across California could be delayed or canceled.

CalPERS recovers from Trump tariffs — for now

At a board meeting Monday, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System reported that it has exceeded its investment targets and has rebounded from the economic hit it took from the pandemic, writes CalMatters’ Adam Ashton.
CalPERS is the nation’s largest public pension fund, and finances the retirement plans of about 2 million people. As of Monday evening, it is worth about $556 billion. CalPERS set out to gain 6.8% on its investments this past financial year, and instead reported that it made 11.6%.
The gains come after a dramatic loss in its portfolio in April, when Trump’s inconsistent rollout of new tariff policies caused a $6.6 trillion stock market wipeout. By May the pension fund recovered from its April low of $508 million, but it still remains underfunded since it’s worth less than what it owes over time to government workers and retirees.
During the meeting, CalPERS leaders also received a number of comments from the public urging the fund to divest from the electric car company Tesla. Though calls to divest from Tesla aren’t new, the involvement of its CEO, Elon Musk, in Trump’s administration — such as his time leading the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency — has sparked renewed pressure to divest.

CA sues Trump over frozen school funds

Joining a coalition of 23 other states, California is suing the Trump administration over its withholding of $6.8 billion dollars in educational funding weeks before the start of the new school year.
Citing that nearly $940 million of federal funding has been frozen for California, Attorney General Rob Bonta unveiled the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education on Monday. He and three other state attorneys general at a news conference argued that withholding the money undermines Congress’ authority over the budget. 

Bonta: “Our states are owed the billions in federal funding that Trump and (U.S. Secretary Linda) McMahon have frozen, and we’re going to court to see that it’s reinstated.”

Congress had already set aside the money for schools in March, which schools took in consideration for their own budgets. But rather than the federal education department releasing the funds on July 1 as expected, the department instead notified schools that it was reviewing the money. Among other services, the money goes toward teacher professional development and after school programs.
Monday’s announcement marks the 31st lawsuit the state has filed against the current Trump administration. In another lawsuit, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Trump administration can fire federal workers at the education department, clearing a path to dismantle the agency completely.

Officials are shoring up water systems infiltrated by the golden mussel. Dogs and human inspectors are checking boats at some lakes, but a patchwork of oversight leaves many lakes unprotected. “There’s just too many boats and too many people out there,” one warden said.



One of the state’s best investigators was on the hunt for golden mussels — a dangerous new invader in California’s waters, with a reputation for destruction. 
Wearing a collar and a tongue-lolling grin, Allee, a Belgian Malinois, sniffed along the glittering hull of a bass boat at an inspection station in Butte County. 
The dog’s handler, California Department of Fish and Wildlife Warden Mark Rose, pointed at the outboard motor and the dog delicately nosed the propellers. She stretched up on her hind legs to get a good whiff of the port side before Rose led her away. She yawned. Nothing here.
The dog was searching for any hint of the thimble-sized mussels hidden in the nooks and crannies of boats headed to Lake Oroville, the state’s second-largest reservoir, or two smaller reservoirs nearby. Her human counterparts at the Department of Water Resources’ inspection station combed the boat’s interior for standing water that could harbor larvae. 
Mandatory boat inspections are among the few weapons in California’s arsenal for protecting its thousands of lakes and reservoirs from the invasion. The mussels’ prolific growth and voracious appetites can upend entire ecosystems, encrust underwater surfaces, choke off water supplies and damage dams and power plants. 
“We have been on high alert,” said Tanya Veldhuizen, special projects section manager in  the California Department of Water Resources’ environmental assessment branch, which operates the state’s water delivery system. “It’s not just on our doorstep, it’s in our house.”

State water managers made the alarming discovery last October that golden mussels, which are native to China and Southeast Asia, had invaded the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta —  the core of California’s massive water delivery systems.  It marked the first detection in North America. 
“To everyone’s horror, it was in many, many more places than we expected. The further they looked, the further they found them.”TED GROSHOLZ, UC DAVIS COASTAL AND MARINE SCIENCES INSTITUTE 
The mussels, first discovered encrusting a float near the Port of Stockton, have already infiltrated California’s two major state and federal water systems, which export water from the Delta to supply 30 million people and millions of acres of farmland. Their larvae are spreading through the network of pumps, pipes and canals.
“To everyone’s horror, it was in many, many more places than we expected,” said Ted Grosholz, a professor emeritus with the UC Davis Coastal and Marine Sciences Institute. “The further they looked, the further they found them.”
Now the mussels are here to stay. They cannot be eradicated. Water suppliers bracing for the onslaught have instead turned their efforts to shoring up pipes, pumps and treatment plants against the infestation. 

The state’s most immediate priority is protecting the small pipes at upstream pumping facilities that keep water deliveries flowing, then they’ll move their efforts downstream, Veldhuizen said.
“It is a huge undertaking,” Veldhuizen said. “We’re not looking at removing mussels from all the water, because it’s just not feasible.”
The race is on to keep the mussels and their microscopic larvae from infesting untainted lakes by stowing away on hulls or inside damp, internal cavities of boats.
But resources are stretched precariously thin. There is no funding dedicated to fighting invasive golden mussels in the state’s budget. And each new infestation means one more place from which they can spread. 
Boaters statewide are warned to “clean, drain and dry” anything that touches water before moving it to another lake or river. Microscopic larvae can survive in tiny amounts of trapped water. Adult mussels may survive for around a week or longer with no water at all. 
Water managers in some lakes and reservoirs now require inspections, quarantine periods and decontamination with hot water before boats can enter. Others have closed or limited access to boating. But a patchwork of oversight leaves many lakes with no protection at all. 
‘Oh, look what we found’ — the hunt for mussels
Allee, with her sensitive snout and devotion to Rose, is one of the state’s more finely-honed weapons against this invasion. But she is one of only 14 dogs with the wildlife agency trained to detect invasive mussels, Rose said.  And she is also tasked with sniffing out the guns, ammunition and kills of wildlife poachers farther north in Tehama County, where Rose is the only game warden for nearly 3,000 square miles.

A state and federal mussels task force released recommendations in April, including mandatory decontamination of boats in infested areas for longer than five days and prevention programs at all accessible, uninfested waters.  But these are monumental tasks, especially amid federal staff cuts and the state’s $12 billion budget deficit. California’s fish and wildlife agency, for instance, is severely understaffed, with only 33% of the resources needed to fulfill its law enforcement duties and 26% needed for habitat and species conservation, according to a 2021 analysis mandated by the Legislature.Even so, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed cutting 164 vacant positions at the department this year, including wardens and other enforcement positions, according to HD Palmer with the Department of Finance.  Lawmakers rejected the cuts for now, but the finance department said the budget does not provide funding to fight golden mussels.“Everybody’s under fire,” UC Davis’ Grosholz said. “It’s not a great time for resource agencies to suddenly have a brand new threat.” 
“They’re actually doing some good to keep the mussels out of the (Oroville) water. Don’t know what they’re doing with all the other thousands of lakes around that they’re not monitoring, though.” DEAN DYRR, BOATER AT LAKE OROVILLE
At the Department of Water Resources’ Oroville inspection station last month, trucks hauling expensive fishing boats and beat-up skiffs rolled over the dusty parking lot at the Thermalito Forebay, a smaller, downstream reservoir.  The boats that passed Allee’s smell test and neon-vested inspectors were recorded and tagged, then sent to the open ramps. Boats that failed because they were still wet — even wet cupholders and life jackets can trigger a failure — were sent to a decontamination station, where they were sprayed and flushed with steaming water. Inspection stations set up by multiple agencies have already intercepted boats contaminated with golden mussels bound for lakes Tahoe, Folsom, Berryessa and Oroville. Leaning against his sailboat at an Oroville boat ramp, boater Dean Dyrr said inspectors spotted mussels on the boat right next to his when his sailboat was checked at the Thermalito Forebay in May.“They were like, ‘Oh, look what we found!’ and it was a handful of mussels,” Dyrr said as his wife loaded up their boat with supplies and water. Lake Oroville glinted against the dry, oak-studded foothills, and dozens of boats bobbed on its surface. 
When mussels are found, the boat is pressure-washed and flushed with hot water, then confirmed free of mussels before it can be launched at the lake.
“The program’s actually working. They’re actually doing some good to keep the mussels out of the water” at Oroville, Dyrr said. “Don’t know what they’re doing with all the other thousands of lakes around that they’re not monitoring, though.”

Various authorities — federal, state, local and private — manage access to California’s lakes and reservoirs. Of particular concern are the lakes and waterways that are not fed by Delta water, because they have the best chance of being spared infestations.Around thirty lakes and reservoirs have inspection programs and quarantine requirements of up to 60 days, and a handful have limited or barred access to boats, according to the state’s Division of Boating and Waterways’ analysis of a list they maintain. The division warns, however, that the list is not comprehensive and is kept as a courtesy with the limited staff that they have; boaters are advised to contact lakes and reservoirs to confirm. Among the biggest gaps in oversight are federally-managed Whiskeytown and Shasta lakes.  Shasta Lake is the biggest reservoir in the state, and both are popular with boaters. Neither have mandatory inspection programs. “If golden mussels are detected in Shasta Lake, we will reassess the current approach and consider additional measures,” a spokesperson with the U.S. Forest Service said in an email. The agency asks boaters to voluntarily dry their boats for five days between visits to local North State lakes like Shasta and Whiskeytown, and 30 days if entering the lakes from outside the area. Laura Shaskey, division lead of resource management and interpretation with the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, said voluntary inspections are offered during peak visiting periods. The inspection programs that do exist are costly and labor intensive. Lake Tahoe’s has been in place since 2008, after invasive quagga mussels breached California’s borders. But golden mussels are more ecologically nimble than previous invaders, and can survive in a much bigger range of waters. So the threat that they pose to Lake Tahoe is even greater, said Jeff Cowen, a spokesperson for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. 
“There’s just too many boats and too many people out there to not miss them. It’s physically impossible.”MARK ROSE, STATE FISH AND WILDLIFE WARDEN
The agency has budgeted $1.1 million this fiscal year for its mandatory inspection program, which now also requires decontamination for boats entering on trailers. Boaters launching for the first time in Tahoe will need to pay a $115 registration fee for the year, plus $30 to $60 decontamination fees each time the boat returns from another lake. Kayaks, paddleboards and other hand-launched boats can skip the line and be decontaminated for free.  At Folsom Lake and Lake Clementine, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and California State Parks require boaters to quarantine their boats for 30 days after inspection before they can enter the water, or pay a company for decontamination. By mid-June, staff braving sometimes sweltering weather had inspected more than 7,000 boats in just two months. But for all the expense and effort, there are still too many ways for boats to leave the Delta with invasive stowaways, and too few resources to stop them. There are also traces of DNA that suggest golden mussels had already invaded the Delta more than a year before they were first spotted near the Port of Stockton, Veldhuizen said. “There is the real potential that watercraft have moved golden mussels out of the Delta, and my fear is that we will begin to see detections outside of that interconnected water,” Martha Volkoff, environmental program manager for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Invasive Species Program, said at a recent webinar. Still, Volkoff told CalMatters, it is worth trying to slow the spread as much as possible. California has done it before: Quagga mussels are thought to have spread to only two unconnected bodies of water since they were first discovered in Southern California’s Colorado River Aqueduct in 2007. “There’s so much to protect yet,” Volkoff said. “Yes, it’s a lot of work, but the long-term savings — to the environment and to all the other ways that it costs us — is investment well spent, even if we just delay new introductions.” Rose, in his K-9 unit vest, led Allee toward a pickup hauling an aluminum fishing boat when the driver rattled away, kicking up dust. The boat had not been inspected; the lake he was heading to — Collins Lake, in Yuba County — doesn’t require them. “There’s just too many boats and too many people out there to not miss them. It’s physically impossible,” Rose said. Another boat pulled up, and Allee happily trotted over.
Boaters upset about long dry-outs 
About 25 miles away in the Sierra foothills, Collins Lake brimmed with campers on a Friday afternoon in June. People lounged on the sandy beach and paddled on kayaks and floats. A handful of fishing boats bobbed in the deeper water. 
A sign at the lake’s boat ramp warned “DON’T MOVE A MUSSEL. CLEAN. DRAIN. DRY.” It was a precaution against the older threats of quagga and zebra mussels, and hadn’t been updated yet to include the state’s newest invader.

There was no one checking boats at the ramp, though — which had drawn Mark Mezzanares and his friend Sonny Steuart to the lake. The retirees from Colfax were put off by the 30-day dry-out periods required at Folsom Lake in Sacramento County and Rollins Lake in Nevada County, though boaters who want to fast-track entry can pay for disinfection. 
“I’m not gonna go sit over there and have my boat sit in the freaking driveway for 30 days and then go fishing once,” Mezzanares said. Rollins’ quarantine is an even more stringent 60 days for boats with bilges, ballasts and live water tanks that could carry stowaways. 
“You don’t buy and spend $45,000 on a boat to go to one lake,” he said. They wished the state offered a pass that allowed boats cleared for one lake to visit others. 
It’s a common refrain among boaters who chafe at the new restrictions. Maggie Macias, a spokesperson for the Department of Water Resources, said in an email they are discussing a pass program from Lake Oroville with other lake managers, but will need to ensure that any potential partners have rigorous inspections — and don’t already have mussels in the water themselves. 
Those whose livelihoods depend on keeping lakes open for visitors are facing a difficult new reality. Jacob Young, the general manager of Collins Lake recreation area, is leaving it up to the boaters to ensure their boats are clean, drained and dry — at least for now.  
“You can just sense a lot of that frustration that they’re feeling, like, ‘This is ridiculous,’” Young said. “And the same token, you get some people who might say, ‘Man, you’re not doing any golden mussel inspections? How could you not be doing that and making sure you’re staying safe?’” 
At the boat ramp, water poured from the motor of a cherry-red bass boat that visitor Dan Jacobs had just hauled off the lake. Jacobs said he wished California had a network of courtesy decontamination stations like the ones offered in Minnesota to combat the spread of invasive zebra mussels, instead of lengthy quarantines. 
“One of the rare times our tax dollars were spent wisely,” he said. 
For him, the risk to Collins Lake feels personal; he and his wife camped there decades ago, when he was stationed at Beale Air Force Base, and now their children and grandchildren return for family camping trips. 
“As bad as the mussels are, it makes you kind of nervous,” he said. “All it takes is one person to screw it up for everyone.”

New regulations signed by President Donald Trump caps their federal borrowing at $200,000 for medical degrees.","In summary
Doctors regularly need to pay more than $300,000 for medical school, including tuition and housing. New regulations signed by President Donald Trump caps their federal borrowing at $200,000 for medical degrees.


Becoming a doctor will likely become even more difficult under the new tax bill Congress approved after lawmakers slashed the amount of money medical school students can borrow in federal loans.The extra burden may mean fewer students choose careers in medicine, particularly low-income students. Patients, in turn, may see fewer doctors practicing family medicine.The new rules, part of the sweeping Republican-backed “big, beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4, cap federal debt for professional degree students at $50,000 annually and $257,000 for the life of a student’s college journey, including undergraduate debt. 
Previously graduate students could borrow up to the cost of their programs to afford their degrees with so-called Grad PLUS loans. Starting next year, those loans will disappear. While all graduate programs are affected by the new law, medical school lasts four years and regularly requires more than $300,000 for tuition, housing, food and other expenses for a degree.Without public loans, many students will have to borrow from private lenders, which provide far fewer protections for loan repayment and, unlike federal plans, don’t offer loan forgiveness. 
Public service loan forgiveness, which can occur after 10 years of employment in nonprofit settings, is a particular draw for medical school graduates who choose to work in government or nonprofit hospitals and care facilities that pay less but have a mission of treating the poor. 
Private lenders may also deny some students loans or charge higher interest rates based on their financial history. Private loans typically require cosigners, which not all borrowers are able to arrange. 
Martha Santana-Chin, chief executive of the insurer L.A. Care Health Plan, said the cost of college, medical school and loan repayment already presents “financial barrier after financial barrier” that prevents many from pursuing medicine. Reliance on private loans will make it even harder for low-income students in particular to become doctors, she said.“If you don’t have access to loans, if you don’t have access to preferred loan terms, it’s going to be that much more difficult for you,” Santana-Chin said.
The rules kick in for new students July 1, 2026. A student who has Grad PLUS before that date can continue to use it for their remaining program term, up to a maximum of three years.
The lower borrowing limits are a key way Congress tried to record savings in the tax bill. By capping how much graduate students can borrow, limiting how much loan debt is forgiven and increasing in many cases how much borrowers of all degrees pay monthly, taxpayers cover less of the tab. But the Republican bill includes huge tax and revenue cuts that, even with other budget savings, add more than $3 trillion to the national debt in the next decade. The higher-ed savings were about $300 billion.
”Straightforward economic logic would suggest (the new rules) are going to make it less likely for some of those students to be able to pursue graduate degrees than they are now,” said Jordan Matsudaira, a professor at American University. He was also chief economist at the U.S. Department of Education during the Biden administration.
“I don’t think we’ve ever been in a position where we’ve sent students to the private loan market looking for loans on this scale to be able to finance their education,” he added.
California medical school debt levels
U.S. Department of Education data from the Biden administration that Matsudaira shared with CalMatters show California’s largest producer of doctors, the University of California, regularly graduates students with debt in excess of $200,000, the most the new law says a graduate student in a professional program may borrow from the government.

At UC Irvine’s school of medicine, the median debt from federal loans for med students was $195,000 for the years 2019-20 to 2022-23. That means that half of the students borrowed more and likely almost all of the new students in those situations would need private loans. Twenty-five percent of students there borrowed at least $254,000 and 10% borrowed at least $284,000. 
Every UC medical school had at least 10% of graduates with debt above $200,000. For UC Riverside, it was $270,000. At UCLA and UC San Diego, 10% of graduates borrowed more than $255,000. 
Many new graduates in similar situations would need $55,000 to $70,000 or more in private debt to finance their education. 
Four of the six UC medical schools had at least 10% of students borrowing more than $73,000 in a single year; new students in similar situations would need to find at least $23,000 in financing from private loans or some other support.
At the private University of Southern California, 50% of graduates borrowed more than $260,000, and 25% borrowed in excess of $328,000, so a large chunk of new students would need to borrow at least $128,000 in private loans or find other ways of paying. A spokesperson for the school said no one was available to answer CalMatters’ questions. 

There were 1,334 students graduating with medical degrees and 361 with similar doctor of osteopathic medicine degrees in 2023, a UC San Francisco report found. The UCs accounted for nearly 800 medical degree graduates.

The University of California perspective
Calvin Yang, a rising senior at UC Berkeley, said attending medical school has been his dream since he was a child. The new caps on federal borrowing won’t deter him from becoming a doctor, but they’ll slow him down and may force him to attend cheaper schools.He plans to take at least one gap year after he graduates next spring and work to save as much as he can to avoid private loans.“It’s frustrating to see restrictions on our ability to simply want to pursue an education in order to help the world, right?” he asked. “Long COVID persists. Mental health remains a major issue, diabetes, obesity — those all require medical professionals.”He thinks some students will “reconsider the medical school pathway.” The loan caps are a concern among his friends with medical school ambitions.“We do think that the private market will meet a lot of the needs of those students,” said Shawn Brick, associate vice provost of student financial support for the UC Office of the President. “Approval rates are fairly high for medical students.”Still, “we do share the concern … about the student who may not have credit that would give them access to loans in the private market.”Brick said the UC has time to work with private lenders to work on financial products that “would be more accessible to students who maybe don’t have the best credit.”Nearly 3,000 UC med students receive an average of $32,000 in UC grants to support their education. The UC also issues its own loans, but in small numbers.The median loan size UC med students have had to borrow has declined by about $50,000 over the past four years, adjusted for inflation, UC data show. At the same time, UC grant aid for med students has grown by about 50%. 

Doctors and advocates weigh in
Even before these changes, Dr. Julián Restrepo said medical school leaves doctors with so much debt that he knows people who are paying off loans decades after graduating, surgeons who work multiple jobs and resident physicians who pick up extra shifts to make ends meet.
“It is a huge burden for us, and it very well determines where we live, where we work, how we work and how we manage our practices,” Restrepo said.
Restrepo graduated from Texas A&M University’s medical school in 2012 and did his residency at Los Angeles County Medical Center. He now works as a primary care physician at a federally qualified health center in Los Angeles and said public service loan forgiveness is an effective way to recruit high quality physicians and specialists to underserved areas. 
With interest, Restrepo’s loan of about $230,000 grew to more than $300,000. He made payments on the loan as part of the public service loan forgiveness program for about seven years until a Biden-era loan forbearance program temporarily kicked in. An L.A. Care program aimed at recruiting physicians to underserved areas will pay off the remainder of his loans, and Restrepo said he’s extremely fortunate. At many points in his career he was forced to defer his loan payments because he couldn’t afford it. 
The American Association of Medical Colleges also thinks the impending reliance on private loans may lead to fewer future doctors. “We are concerned that this added barrier could deter qualified candidates from pursuing a medical degree altogether, which could ultimately worsen the existing and expected physician workforce shortage,” said Kristen Earle, director of student financial services at the association, which oversees the medical school entrance exam. The association projects a national shortage of 86,000 physicians by 2036. California, like much of the country, has a shortage of primary care physicians, with the Central Coast, Central Valley and Southern Border regions projected to have the most severe shortages.
More pressure on medical residents
And while medical degrees eventually lead to relatively high salaries that are typically $220,000 a year to more than $400,000 depending on the specialization, early career doctors earn much less in residency, a training period of three to sometimes seven or more years. As residents, doctors work 60 to 80 hours a week for salaries of about $70,000 to $100,000, depending on the region and whether residents are unionized.Private lenders offer a wide range of interest rates for medical school, from about 3% to more than 14%. Federal rates fall in the middle of that range, are less variable and pegged to inflation. Some private lenders indicate online that they don’t require borrowers to pay while they’re in residency for a few years, while others require only a small payment. In either case, the unpaid interest grows the overall debt a borrower will have to pay off.
Earle said she hopes that private lenders keep interest rates fairly low for medical school students because they’re a good bet to pay off their debt given the higher earnings potential.
Mahima Iyengar is in her final year of residency at the massive Los Angeles General Medical Center to become a primary care physician.She said she borrowed $250,000 in federal loans to attend medical school — $50,000 above next year’s maximum — and has no idea how someone like her would have avoided private loans. She wanted to study at the public University of Maryland, a less expensive option in her home state, but wasn’t admitted. Instead she attended the University of Rochester, another highly competitive but pricier private medical school hundreds of miles from home.“I could have tried to live cheaper in med school, but I don’t think it would have been much more possible than how I was living with three, four roommates,” said the 31-year-old, who’s also a leader in her union.Like a majority of medical school students, Iyengar knew she’d use public service loan forgiveness. Now that option will be gone for professional school debt above $200,000. 
“We want a diverse group of people taking care of patients, because we know that patients have better outcomes from providers that understand where they’ve come from,” she said. But that diversity might ebb if lower-income students, who are more likely to be students of color, feel priced out of med school.UC agrees. “We don’t know for sure, but we are concerned about this slowing the efforts to build the physician workforce across the country, and especially in California, where we’ve got significant needs in primary care in rural areas,” said Heather Harper, spokesperson for UC’s medical operations.
L.A. Care has invested $255 million since 2018 in scholarships for medical students and loan repayment for physicians to try and recruit doctors, but Santana-Chin said it’s not enough money to meet the need. She hopes that medical schools see the federal changes as a “call to action” to make education more affordable, she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/041923_UC-Davis-Medical_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-15 09:04:28.932277

And this time, the cause isn’t homegrown.","Guest Commentary written by

Nils Gilman
Nils Gilman is the chief operating officer and executive vice president of the Berggruen Institute.


California has finally made real progress on one of its most stubborn problems: the housing crisis. After decades of paralysis, the state has begun to unwind the bureaucratic thicket that made it almost impossible to build new homes in cities. This should be a moment for cautious optimism.
Yet a new and very different problem looms — one that threatens to undermine these hard-won reforms before a single unit is built: a growing national effort to crack down on the very workers California needs to build its future.
This summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed through a pair of bills — Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131 — that amount to the most significant overhaul of California’s development rules in more than 50 years. In particular, the reforms are massively curtailing the California Environmental Quality Act, which for decades has allowed opponents to block urban housing with endless lawsuits and reviews. 
Urban infill projects near transit are now largely exempt from CEQA litigation. Developers are, for the first time in a generation, preparing to build at scale.
But just as California removes the red tape, it may find itself caught in another bind: a lack of construction workers. And this time, the cause isn’t homegrown.
More than 40% of California’s construction workforce is foreign-born, according to the National Association of Homebuilders. That includes more than half a million immigrants, many of them undocumented, who work as framers, drywallers, roofers and laborers. 
These are physically demanding jobs, often shunned by native-born workers. Without them, the math of housing development simply doesn’t work.
Yet the national political winds are blowing in the opposite direction. The Trump-aligned right has completely changed the conversation about immigration. Their focus is on deporting not just criminals, but all undocumented migrants. Mass deportation, as recently as last year considered a fringe idea, is now the openly stated policy objective. 
The implications for industries that rely heavily on immigrants are as dire as they are obvious. Heightened enforcement, even without sweeping raids, creates fear and uncertainty. Some workers leave preemptively. Others move into the shadows.
The result? Just as building permits get faster, the labor force that builds will get scarcer. Construction firms already report difficulty assembling full crews. Wages are rising. Projects are being delayed — not by paperwork, but by a shortage of hands.
If this trend continues, California risks an awkward outcome: a flood of new housing approvals but not enough workers to actually build them. The “abundance agenda” could turn into a shelf full of blueprints. 
In the worst case, we end up with a hollow boom — developments greenlit but never started, or started but never finished.
As construction lags, pressure will mount on Sacramento to push back against federal immigration policy. California has clashed with Washington before — on climate, guns, and abortion. Housing could be next. Newsom, perhaps eyeing national office, may argue that federal immigration enforcement is sabotaging state-led economic reform. 
This will be a high-stakes confrontation. The federal government controls immigration. California controls land use. The two are now on a collision course.
The deeper irony is hard to miss. For years, the consensus was that California’s housing problems were self-inflicted — caused by too much regulation and not enough political courage. Now that the state is finally addressing those issues, it’s being undermined by a different kind of politics: a national campaign against the very people who build homes.
If California wants to realize its new housing vision, it will need not just faster permits but also enough skilled workers to turn blueprints into homes. That means protecting the workforce it has — even when doing so puts it at odds with Washington.
Otherwise, we will be left with the worst of both worlds: new rules, no results and a housing crisis that continues to degrade the quality of life for far too many Californians.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/070822_Housing-Elk-Grove_RL_CM_21.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-15 09:04:28.932277

(Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images)NEW ORLEANS – Before Louisiana expanded Medicaid in 2016, DePaul Community Health Centers served about 20,000 patients, regardless of their ability to pay. As more Louisianians enrolled in Medicaid, the number of DePaul’s patients more than doubled, said Michael Griffin, DePaul’s president and CEO. Today, most of their 50,000 patients are covered by Medicaid.

“ Medicaid funding has helped us to take care of more people,” he said. “More people had coverage.”
Now, Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade under the sweeping cuts to the program in the latest budget reconciliation law, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Policy analysts with the nonprofit KFF estimate that more than 200,000 Louisiana residents could lose their insurance in the next decade as the provisions of the law unfold.
Griffin and other community health providers in New Orleans worry there won’t be enough funds to provide care when the number of uninsured patients starts to rise.
“We know that our uninsured population is going to go up, so how do we cover the cost of care for those individuals?” Griffin said. “ We don’t want them going to the emergency room, which is going to cost the whole system and the state more money.”
Community health centers aim to lower emergency room visits and increase access to preventative care by reducing barriers, such as cost, distance or language. They also help patients enroll in Medicaid or plans subsidized under the Affordable Care Act.

After Louisiana expanded Medicaid eligibility, the number of uninsured people plummeted by 60% in the following four years. By 2023, more than a third of New Orleans residents were enrolled in Medicaid.
Under the new law, Medicaid recipients will eventually be required to work at least 80 hours a month and verify their eligibility twice a year. Both provisions will steeply increase the administrative burden on both patients and community health care providers. Griffin said the paperwork requirements could lead to people losing their insurance, and he said New Orleans residents are especially vulnerable because of the sizable self-employed population.
“ How do our musicians, our artists, our culture bearers, who work at their own rate and pace, prove that they’re doing work 20 hours a week?” he said. “ It’s very important that they stay healthy just like everyone else.”
The New Orleans Musicians’ Clinic, which has served artists and culture bearers for more than 20 years, is also bracing for the changes.
Peggy Honore, president of the New Orleans Musicians’ Clinic and Assistance Foundation, said even the addition of $35 copay for some services — another impending change to Medicaid — could determine whether an artist can receive care.
“ It’s going to be an increased burden on us from a fundraising perspective to make sure that musicians continue to have access to health care,” she said.
Griffin said it isn’t yet clear how to implement the law’s provisions or how much funding community health clinics will receive to help with compliance. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is expected to provide guidance within the next six months. Although Congress has allocated $475 million to help with implementation of the work and eligibility requirements as well as $50 billion toward rural health, Griffin said that money won’t be enough to offset $1 trillion of cuts to the program over the next decade.
Many of the law’s most significant changes to Medicaid, including the work and eligibility requirements, don’t start until the end of 2026 or later. Meanwhile, SarahJane Guidry, CrescentCare’s policy and advocacy director, said the federally qualified health clinic’s team will focus on preparing their patients for the new requirements and training staff to work under the new system.
“ We’re preparing to make sure that that human impact and that burden is as small as it possibly can be,” Guidry said.
On Friday, top Democratic congressional leaders gathered in New Orleans at CrescentCare on Canal Street. U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, joined by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other representatives, said Democrats will try to use any legislative tool available to roll back changes to Medicaid, especially if they gain a majority after midterm elections in 2026.
”We’re gonna find every opportunity to tweak, change and repeal,” Carter said.
As Congress works through a dozen appropriations bills for the next couple fiscal years, Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who sits on the appropriations committee, said Democrats plan to propose amendments to reverse parts of the new law. But any such amendments would face an uphill battle in the Republican-led House and Senate.

(Photo: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.When Kelly Durrows was told two years ago that she qualified for an Emergency Housing Voucher, funded by federal recovery dollars, she assumed she would be added to another waiting list and wouldn’t exit homelessness for another year or two. 
But four months later, a case worker in Reno handed her a key to her apartment in ending her 15 years of on and off homelessness in 2023. She has been stably housed ever since. 
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, signed into law by former President Joe Biden, included $5 billion in investments to create 70,000 emergency vouchers nationwide. 
More than 600 emergency vouchers are currently in use across Nevada according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development data. 
“Normally each year, we’re able to move about 10 people into permanent supportive housing,”  said Catrina Peters, the homelessness services coordinator for Washoe County. 
The emergency housing vouchers “allowed us to make 137 referrals” to get people off the streets, she said.
The specialized vouchers were supposed to be funded through 2030, but jurisdictions around the country, including in Reno, were informed by HUD in March that they would receive a final allotment this year to cover “those remaining amounts will be available to cover (EVA Housing Assistance Program) costs in 2026.”
“We did always kind of have that (2030) end date in mind,” Peters said, adding that “the more recent correspondence to potentially end in the program in 2026 was quite a surprise.”
“We have extremely limited resources and extremely limited opportunities to serve these folks through other programs,” she said. “Any reduction in a program impacts our ability to get people housed and out of homelessness.”
Homelessness has steadily been on the rise in the state, as in most of the country. 
More than 10,100 people experienced homelessness in Nevada in 2024 – a 17% increase statewide – according to data released by HUD in December.
“We’re seeing rents not increasing as dramatically as they have been in the previous years, but still continuing to rise,” Peters said. “We have a lot of folks on fixed incomes who don’t see a corresponding increase to their income.”
Housing vouchers, already scarce, would be even harder to get under Trump’s budget bill

The end strategy for those emergency housing vouchers, Peters said, is to at some point have “them moved into the existing housing authority pool, or kind of absorbed into that existing voucher pool,” which is the Housing Choice Vouchers program, formerly known as Section 8.
More than 15,000 people receive standard housing vouchers statewide, with thousands on the waitlist hoping  to qualify for a voucher.
The regular housing voucher program is likely to face cuts as well. 
President Donald Trump 2026 fiscal budget proposed steep cuts across various agencies, including slashing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development budget by more than 40%.
“I think if folks want to see a meaningful decrease in the number of people experiencing homelessness, people on the street, people living in cars, then we need to maintain these programs and not see any cuts,” Peters said. 
‘A golden ticket’
Durrows, 47, moved from California to Carson City about 15 years ago to live with her mom when she needed a place to stay while she was unemployed.
Her mother died a few months later, and her stepfather asked her to move out. Durrows relocated to Reno, got a job as a housekeeper, and moved into a new apartment. 
But she lost her job and could no longer afford rent. That was her first time experiencing homelessness. 
Durrows bounced around to Georgia and Texas, but eventually came back to Reno for good in 2018. 
“I barely slept. That’s when the drugs came in. I barely could sleep because I had to stay up and keep my dog warm and keep burning fires, and I had to keep hand warmers up under the blankets.”
Durrows briefly stayed at Reno’s Cares Campus Emergency Shelter in 2023 and was eventually connected with Michael Adragna, a case manager.
During that time, she qualified for an emergency housing voucher. Knowing there is a long wait list for unhoused people to get housing assistance, Durrows figured it was too good to be true
“When they told me that I was approved, I was like, ‘Yeah, okay, I’m approved, but it’s gonna take two, three years to get it,’ ” Durrows said.
But a few months later, she was in her new place. It’s the first time in her life that she has ever “felt planted,” she said. 
“I quit doing drugs,” she said. “I quit doing all this craziness.”
Even after Durrow’s first landlord decided not to renew the lease, she was able to secure another apartment using the same voucher. 
Adragna likened the emergency voucher to “a golden ticket.”
“The alternative programs with housing authority were kind of like being on a wait list to nowhere,” he said. 
Once people are on typical wait lists for various types of housing assistance, such as a housing choice voucher, Adragna said they could be on there “for maybe two to three years.”
What made these emergency vouchers more successful is they came with less stringent requirements from HUD, said Brenda Barnes, the social services manager for Clark County.
“These (vouchers) were more unique in regards to less deniability,” she said. “There are background checks and various other types of requirements for different vouchers. Some require a disability. These were a little bit more flexible, which made them more accessible.”
For the first time, the door to housing was open to people who typically don’t qualify for housing assistance, such as people with criminal backgrounds who can’t access traditional housing vouchers.
“It was exciting and amazing to see how quickly we utilized these vouchers” to help people “who were falling through the gaps in other resources in the community,” Barnes said.  
Peters said that in Washoe County roughly 90% of those who qualified for the emergency vouchers received case management, and have remained stably housed. 
The vouchers, and the household stability they enable, allows the county “to reduce community wide costs for people who were previously using the emergency room heavily and previously had a lot of interactions with law enforcement.” 
The emergency voucher program is “the last thing that should be cut,” Peters said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54642266096_fd9c809767_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 09:04:28.932277

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Meanwhile, in Utah, enrollment changes were less than 1%, according to the report.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

Where is the district located?

The district covers part of Cullman, including Good Hope, Garden City, Colony and Smith Lake. 

How did the seat become vacant?

The seat became vacant after former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April after he was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session.

Does the seat have a partisan lean?

District 11 is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022.

What issues dominate the race?

SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, was signed by Gov. Kay Ivey on May 7. The bill allows the city of Cullman to annex a resort in Cullman County, a dry county, in order for the resort to serve alcohol. All four Republican candidates strongly oppose the legislation.
Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.

What happens after today?

The Republican with the most votes will face Democratic candidate Matthew Glover, a 40-year-old former Good Hope City councilman on Oct. 28. If a candidate does not receive 50% of the vote, a runoff primary election will be held on Aug. 12.

Will the results alter control of the Legislature?

No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24. Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, announced her resignation and move to the Florida panhandle last week. Republicans hold 27 of the 35 seats in the Alabama Senate.

Maribeth Leonard, CEO of LifeWays– a community mental health services program that serves Hillsdale and Jackson counties– outlined how this proposal could upend Michigan’s existing system of regionally governed behavioral health oversight.
In a letter to the community. Leonard said the change in the funding model would “move decisions about mental health care funding and oversight further from the communities they serve, threatening the transparency, accountability, and responsiveness that define Michigan’s public system.”

LETTER TO THE EDITOR – Protecting Local Mental Health Care from Privatization – 07.09.2025 
Michigan’s current infrastructure comprises ten Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans, or PIHP. These regional administrative entities are charged with managing a region’s behavioral health Medicaid funds. The Mid-State Health Network, for example, serves 21 counties and consists of 11 different community mental health organizations, including LifeWays.
This is not the first time prepaid plans have been threatened with privatization. Indeed, there have been at least five serious attempts over the past decade. Most recently, bills introduced by Republican lawmakers in 2021 stalled in the state Legislature after encountering significant opposition from mental health advocates. Before that, in 2019, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, issued a line-item veto rejecting a budget provision that would have advanced a privatization pilot program first introduced under the administration of former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In this instance, however, the push for privatization comes not from a Republican-led legislature, but from a department within the state’s Democratic-led executive branch: the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
According to MDHHS, the shift to competitive procurement is intended “to address issues within the current PIHP system that compromise service quality, accountability, and efficiency.” The department cited “fragmentation, service inconsistency, and limited accountability” as critical flaws in the current PIHP system.
The department is advancing a plan that would open the contracts for regional prepaid plans to competitive bidding, allowing large nonprofit entities with no local ties to apply. A letter from LifeWays CEO Maribeth Leonard explained that, while the proposal “requires that bidders be nonprofit entities, it still allows large private nonprofits —some of which may operate outside of our region or even our state, like Blue Cross Blue Shield or Meridian Health Plan— to take over functions currently managed by locally governed public agencies.”
The state health department conducted a month-long survey in March 2025, reaching out to 2,600 Michiganders and garnering various perspectives. In a statement to Michigan Advance, the agency elaborated that the plan for privatization was “informed by extensive feedback” from Medicaid beneficiaries and their families, community-based organizations, advocacy groups, and other partners.
In addressing the survey responses, the department said that the proposed plan would “help to increase consumer choice and access to services while preserving the Community Mental Health Services Programs (CMHSPs).”
PIHP public survey summary
Furthermore, the department used the survey responses to develop a four-pillared approach to their proposal, striving to “provide high quality, timely services, improve choice & consistency across regions,  ensure accountability & transparency, and  simplify the system with reduced bureaucracy.”
Interestingly, while both state health department and mental health advocates cite accountability, transparency, and improved response as primary objectives, they propose fundamentally different solutions to achieve them. 
Leonard pointed out that the implementation of this proposal could have unintended consequences, namely increased wait times, lower service quality, decreased provider rates, and heightened rates of provider turnover and closures.
Leonard’s concerns are a reality for several other states: Oklahoma predicted that privatizing mental health care would cost the state an additional $716 million annually. A June 2024 state report from Oregon found that privatization had led to an influx of “phantom networks”—provider directories listing clinicians who aren’t actually accepting patients. North Carolina saw a drastic increase in staff turnover in public-sector mental health, as well as significant increases in behavioral health-related emergency room visits. 
In a letter to Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the Michigan Association of Counties explained that private health plans operate at higher cost than their public counterparts. The current system spends approximately 2% of Medicaid funding on administrative costs, marketing, billing, and executive salaries. On the other hand, privatized infrastructures typically spend around 15% on these overhead costs.
In short, the letter continues, “such an increase would divert over $500 million annually from direct services to administrative expenses, exacerbating existing funding shortfalls and diminishing the quality and accessibility of care.”

PIHP-Letter-to-Governor-May-2025 
Similarly, Leonard emphasized that even if the infrastructure is reduced, the necessity remains. The only difference, she noted, is that those in need of mental health services will end up elsewhere.
 “They’re going to end up in other places–in your jails, they’re going to end up in your emergency departments,” said Leonard. “The need won’t go away.”
 “The other key thing,” she added, “is that right now, the mental health code requires, on our board, the participation of those with lived experience. You’re not going to have that with a private plan.”
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services plans to issue a request for proposal sometime this summer, with the proposed service start date scheduled for October 1, 2026. At this point, the language of the proposal has yet to be formalized.
However, Leonard noted that, based on the preliminary proposal requirements, none of Michigan’s prepaid plans would be eligible to apply. In short, another organization would be able to take control of the state’s mental and behavioral health infrastructure.
Further, she explained, shifting towards a privatized model would divert decision-making power away from the communities. Unlike the current infrastructure, private non-profits are not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, which would leave the community with limited tools to monitor decision-making, spending, or performance. Essentially, Leonard explained, the proposal “threaten[s] the transparency, accountability, and responsiveness that define Michigan’s public system.” 
LifeWays will be hosting an educational forum for state legislators on July 25 that will include a detailed briefing from the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan and the opportunity to engage with community members, local leaders, and policymakers.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/teenmentalhealth.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 08:02:11.580191

This is a huge competitive advantage over other international destinations. All that can change, however, if visitors have to worry about arbitrary detention. (Photo"" iStock/Getty Images)People like me usually defend civil rights as a moral and humanitarian cause, as well as a cornerstone of American democracy, but civil rights also have a measurable economic value and attacking them quickly imposes a real cost. Just as a breakdown in the rule of law creates investment uncertainty that undermines economic growth, undermining civil rights can shatter peoples’ confidence about working, living and spending money here. 
While we’re often reminded that freedom isn’t free, we’re learning now in Nevada that the alternative ain’t cheap either.  President Donald Trump’s arrests and deportations of immigrants and protesters – often without due process or criminal charges – are already taking a toll.  Las Vegas is suffering a slowdown only a few months into Trump’s second term. Tourism is slipping by virtually every measure: hotel occupancies and daily room rates; the number of international visitors; sales tax and gaming revenue. 
Nevada’s Economic Forum, the panel of economic forecasters that prepares the state’s budget assumptions, reduced its 2025 revenue estimate in May by $191 million, about 1.6%. That’s largely because of declining sales taxes and gaming fees.  On top of that, the consensus forecast by the General Assembly’s Legislative Counsel Bureau cut its estimate for the State Education Fund by $160 million.  
To be sure, threats to civil rights aren’t the only cause of that. Trump’s tariffs have played a major role, slowing economic growth and increasing economic uncertainty.  
But the threat to individual civil liberties is a real factor as well. Many European governments, from Germany and France to Denmark and Ireland, have recently issued travel advisories that warn people about new risks travelling to the United States.  These advisories warn that even minor paperwork glitches, or people who identify their gender as “X” on their passports, can jeopardize more than just a vacation. As the German government tells its citizens traveling here, “[e]ven slightly overstaying a travel visa can lead to arrest, detention and deportation.” And that caution is exceedingly polite. European media has been awash in horror stories about travelers who were jailed for weeks for no good reason.
Fabian Schmidt, a German who has a U.S. green card as well as an American partner and daughter, was detained for two months after returning to the U.S. from Luxembourg.   Jessica Brösche, a Berlin tattoo artist on vacation, was held for six weeks – including nine days in solitary – even though she had a valid visa.  Small wonder that Der Spiegel, Germany’s leading news magazine, called U.S. immigration practices “capricious and uncoordinated.” Even the most popular TikTok’er in the world ended up detained by ICE while passing through Las Vegas.
The drop in foreign tourism has been dramatic and statistically significant. For example, Canadian travelers – who make up the largest share of international visitors to Las Vegas – are staying away in droves. Between the blindsiding tariffs imposed on their country, talks of making Canada the fifty-first state, and disturbing reports of Canadians detained for days in ICE facilities over minor visa issues, who could blame them?
We should only expect the international tourist numbers to get worse. Considering reports that customs enforcement have taken to searching people’s phones and denying entry to folks who criticize Donald Trump or his administration, why should we think anyone just looking to have some fun would subject themselves to that sort of treatment?
Part of what makes Las Vegas attractive and globally competitive is its demonstrable safety and security.  The Strip is one the most surveilled areas in the world.  Street crime is very low, and it’s known to be low.  Las Vegas is also one of the world’s most culturally diverse and open cities.  Black, white, Asian, straight, gay, transgender — the city attracts just about any group imaginable.
That’s why tourists, regardless of their nationality, race or gender, throng the streets late at night. This is a huge competitive advantage over other international destinations. All that can change, however, if visitors have to worry about arbitrary detention, deportation, harassment and the absence of due process.  If the U.S. is no longer safe, tourists have other choices and will increasingly go elsewhere.  
 Arbitrary detention and deportation, the dismissal of due process, the punishment of unpopular views, these attacks on civil liberties should terrify us all. But those who put up with these transgressions thinking that they benefit our Nevadan economy are in for a serious disappointment.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2188462685-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 08:02:11.580191
,California,2025-07-15 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,LA Times valiantly explains how Los Angeles became the epicenter of homelessness,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/la-times-explains-epicenter-homelessness/,The Los Angeles Times recently made a valiant attempt to explain how homelessness became a seemingly intractable crisis in L.A. County.,"At its best, journalism reveals the reality that is often obscured in the superficial political rhetoric about high-profile current events.
In California, nothing outranks homelessness as a burning issue and as a political football. Officialdom, from the governor down, not only cannot agree on why the state has so many unhoused people — numerically and relatively the largest such population of any state — but what should be done to ameliorate it.
Tens of billions of dollars have been spent over the last half-decade, but the numbers often rise as state and local officials engage in a blame game, an implicit acknowledgement that voters might punish politicians deemed to have failed.
The Los Angeles Times recently made a valiant attempt to explain how homelessness arose and became a seemingly intractable crisis in Los Angeles County. The exhaustive report, headlined “The real story of how L.A. became the epicenter of America’s homeless crisis,” published last week.
“Today, homelessness feels as inevitable a part of the urban landscape as traffic jams and strip malls,” the journalists accurately observed. “Los Angeles has more people living on the streets than any other city in the United States, which almost certainly makes it the homelessness capital of the developed world.
“There are 15 counties in California whose total populations are smaller than the homeless population of L.A. County, which exceeded 75,000 people in 2023. If you filled Dodger Stadium with all the county’s homeless people, you’d have enough left over to fill Crypto.com Arena downtown.”
The newspaper’s reportage team, led by former Times staffers Mitchell Landsberg and Gale Holland, dived deeply into Southern California’s history — particularly its housing patterns. The conclusion was that the region’s bias for single-family housing, its historic enmity toward housing for low-income residents — particularly nonwhite residents — and “urban renewal” projects that upset neighborhoods and destroyed affordable housing were among the root causes.
Economic upheaval — particularly the loss of good-paying industrial jobs after the World War II boom wore off — was another factor, along with the decreasing mental health care and other social maladies.
“While mental illness, poor medical care, substance abuse, growing income inequality, job loss, racism or another social ill might have been the most visible trigger that put any one person on the street, the housing problem is why they had nowhere else to land,” the Times said, adding, “And it was decisions by policymakers, judges, law enforcement and industrial leaders that caused the shortage.”
All of those factors were at play in the 1970s when the last piece of the homelessness puzzle emerged as the region was beginning to see a new population boom driven largely by immigration from other countries.
“Finally, and crucially, housing prices doubled in Los Angeles from 1975 to 1979 — an extraordinary escalation driven in part by a growing population, inflation and real estate speculation,” the Times reported. “Prices would double several more times in the coming years as the average cost of a home rose from $25,000 in the early 1970s to more than $1 million today. Even adjusting for inflation, a house in Los Angeles today costs roughly six times what it did then and is no longer within reach for the average working-class Angeleno.”
So there it is, a detailed and compelling explanation of why the City of Angels exemplifies California’s homelessness problem and, implicitly, the reason why making inroads is so difficult.
If the most important factor is a lack of affordable housing, the most powerful remedy would be to build more affordable housing, but institutional, political and economic barriers remain rock-solid. California — not just Los Angeles — has been falling behind on housing production for many years despite state-level efforts to reduce those barriers, the latest being an exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act for certain kinds of high-density projects.
On Monday, Los Angeles County officials announced that the latest survey, conducted in January, found a 3,000-person (4%) decline in homelessness from the previous year’s 75,312.
That’s good news, certainly, but the homeless crisis remains and will persist until the housing crisis is solved.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/11082022-LA-StreetMedicine-LV_CM-22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-15 08:02:11.580191

“The Social Security Administration (SSA) is celebrating the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the email message began — using the official name of the massive legislation signed by President Donald Trump that cuts taxes and also slashes spending on Medicaid and SNAP, along with making numerous other policy changes.
White, 71, who lives in Middleton, Wisconsin, has been getting Social Security Administration email since he retired from the Beloit College psychology faculty in 2019. But until the July 4 message, he said, every single one has been straightforward, factual — and nonpolitical.
The message included a misleading description of one provision in the new law. The Social Security Administration later published a correction.
That alone angered White. But that the message was sent at all was just as irritating, he told the Wisconsin Examiner.
The email, including a quote from Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano, “appeared to value currying favor with the president over telling Americans the truth,” White said. “I want our federal agencies to be independent, nonpartisan offices that act with integrity and serve the public, not the president.”
The Social Security message claims that the legislation “ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits…”
“This is a historic step forward for America’s seniors,” Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano stated.
  A screenshot of the Social Security Administration message sent to the agency’s email list early July 4, 2025.
As was soon widely reported, however, the message itself was off the mark.
“I was surprised to see SSA send this out as an email to such a large list since this seems more about politics than anything specific to the program,” said J. Michael Collins, a household economics expert at the University of Wisconsin. Collins directed a Social Security research center at the UW until the Trump administration shut it down earlier this year.
The actual change that the message refers to is to income taxes paid by all people 65 or older with incomes $75,000 a year or less for single filers and $150,000 a year or less for couples — regardless of whether they’re collecting Social Security or not, Collins explained.
While the message appears to single out Social Security income, “there is no new exemption of SSA income from federal income taxes, just a new deduction for all people 65+ regardless of income source,” Collins told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message.
For people who are 64 or younger and who get income from Social Security, there’s no comparable tax cut, he added.
To be sure, the reduction does give some help to taxpayers 65 or older who collect Social Security.
A 2022 IRS tax tip explains that half of Social Security income is taxable for  a single person whose income is $25,000 to $34,000 and for a married couple filing jointly whose income is $32,000 to $44,000.
For a single person with income over $34,000 or a married couple with income over $44,000, 85% of their Social Security income is taxable.
Social Security beneficiaries with incomes below the $75,000 or $150,000 ceiling will get relief from those tax bills — along with everyone else 65 or older whose income also falls below those limits.
The tax break also lasts just a few years, ending in 2028 — stretching the claim that qualifying beneficiaries “will no longer” pay income taxes.
The email message produced a sharp blowback.
“I was appalled — it was really unprecedented,” Nancy Altman, president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told the Wisconsin Examiner in a phone interview. “They’ve taken an agency that’s supposed to be above politics and made it an arm of propaganda.”
Altman recalled that when Social Security checks were mailed in October 1972, President Richard Nixon suggested including an insert in which he could take credit for a benefit increase — even though he had initially opposed it. The commissioner at the time, Robert Ball, threatened to resign if Nixon followed through, and Nixon backed off, Altman said.
As originally worded, the email message appeared to suggest two separate tax cut provisions — one for Social Security recipients 65 and older and one for others:
“The new law includes a provision that eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries, providing relief to individuals and couples. Additionally, it provides an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older, ensuring that retirees can keep more of what they have earned.”
On July 7, the Social Security Administration added a correction and changed the second sentence in that paragraph to, “It does so by providing an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older…”
The correction was previously reported by HuffPost reporter Arthur Delaney.
The morning that he received the Social Security message, White, the retired Beloit professor, wrote back to Bisignano directly — guessing at a direct email address for the Trump-appointed Social Security Commissioner.
“Commissioner Bisignano, When did the Social Security Administration become so blatantly political? I thought government agencies like the USPS were supposed to just go about their business from one administration to the next, but clearly that’s not the case with the SSA. You have become an unabashed mouthpiece for Trump. Shame on you!”
“I was upset that the head of a major federal agency would act in a way that undermines the public’s trust,” White told the Wisconsin Examiner.
“For years, Trump has expressed contempt for America’s once-revered institutions — courts, universities, the press, medical experts, climate scientists, long-time allies abroad … the list is a long one,” White added. “Trump wants to diminish any group or individual who questions his aims or methods.”
The email message appears to play directly to that characteristic of the president, he said, and White fears that will diminish the agency in the public eye.
“What upsets me is that the commissioner of the SSA foolishly wrote a letter that will prompt millions of Americans to question the integrity of the SSA,” White said. “It takes years for an organization to build up a good reputation, but it can be fatally damaged almost overnight.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama legislator wants to expand the number of circumstances that can allow the death penalty to be imposed.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, has prefiled HB 20 for the 2026 session, which would make it a capital offense to murder a person while “knowingly creat(ing) a great risk of death to multiple persons.”
“There are some instances that I feel we should be able to go after the maximum punishment, and increase that punishment to the death penalty, in cases that they have committed these offenses in a public place and in a public manner,” Simpson said in an interview Monday.
Alabama statute outlines 21 circumstances that enhance the penalty to allow the state to charge someone with capital punishment, such as murdering a person who is less than 14 years old or committing the offense in the presence of someone younger than 14 years old, or killing someone while in commission of a robbery or kidnapping. Murdering a law enforcement officer could also enhance a murder charge to a capital offense.
“It is murder that can be moved to capital murder if it falls under one of those enhancements,” Simpson said. “This bill creates the enhancement for causing danger to multiple people.”
Simpson said he believes the bill would serve as a warning that committing the gravest crimes can come with the harshest punishments.
“I think that capital murder will send a message to the community that we are no longer taking this,” Simpson said. “We have seen an increase in public shootings, a significant increase of this in public areas.”
Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform group, said in a statement that evidence showed that “certainty of arrest and conviction is the greatest deterrent to crime, not length of sentence or level of punishment.” Some civil rights groups have said that capital punishment does not deter crime. Crowder said investments in mental health care and violence prevention would work to cut crime in the state.
“Common sense tells us that someone who’s enraged enough to shoot into a crowd of people is probably not going to check the Code of Alabama to determine whether they’d be subject to death or just life in prison before pulling the trigger,” the statement said.
Simpson also introduced legislation in the spring during the 2025 session that would have also expanded eligibility for the death penalty for those who sexually assault minors. The bill, which did not pass, would have joined Alabama with Florida and Tennessee as the states to pass such laws.
“I am optimistic, I am going to file that bill again and hopefully get it a little further,” Simpson said. “There are a lot of good bills that died in the Senate this year due to timing, and I will see how things play out. Sometimes it takes multiple years for a bill to pass.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Senate-May-11-2023-18-Matt-Simpson-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 08:02:11.580191

(Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — A group of 30 protestors gathered in front of the offices of U.S. Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Hoover on Monday in protest of the reconciliation bill passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump earlier this month. 
Protestors, part of the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign Moral Monday, cited figures from Repairers of the Breach that estimated the bill would cost 42,000 Alabamians Medicaid and 165,000 benefits from SNAP, a federal program aimed at curbing hunger in America. 
Rev. Carolyn Foster of Greater Birmingham Ministries led the protest, which included clergy, advocates and people who said they will be affected by cuts in the legislation. Foster said amplifying the stories of people who are going to be directly affected by the Reconciliation Bill is important.
“These are people who have families, these are people who are cared for in their communities and who take care of their own communities, so we want to put a face to these numbers,” she said.
Palmer voted for the bill in the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month. A message seeking comment was left with Palmer’s office Monday. 
Monday’s demonstration is a part of the national strategy put together by Bishop William Barber, the founder of the Poor People’s Campaign and Repairers of the Breach. Alabama was one of 10 states in the south scheduled to have a demonstration against the Reconciliation Bill on Monday, including a flagship protest in Memphis.
LaTrell Clifford Wood, a hunger policy advocate for Alabama Arise, spoke at the demonstration about her personal experience with food insecurity and the health care system.Wood said when she was 14 years old, her family lost access to SNAP benefits and school meals, which came as her mother also struggled to pay for needed medication.
“I was old enough to notice my mom’s distress,” she said. “Fourteen is old enough to notice your parents’ distress, even when she tried to hide it. So I stopped asking for lunch money. Instead I would say I wasn’t hungry and asked my teacher if I could stay inside and draw during lunch to distract myself,” she said.
Wood said with the bill being signed, she’s scared that there will be more stories similar to hers.
“Children in Alabama deserve the chance to be children and to learn and grow and make their own mistakes,” Wood said. “They should not have to bear the burden of the poor moral compasses of those elected officials whose voting record tells them to tough it out.”
The demonstrators also had a list of ways the bill will negatively impact residents, including:

Death by denial of health care
Hospitals in rural areas face closure
Food assistance will be removed from people
Squeezing states on SNAP
Barring lawfully present immigrants from aid
Separating immigrant families
Tax cuts benefit the wealthiest households
Corporate tax rate remains the same
Higher energy costs
Funding war and enriching war profiteers

Protestors attempted to present the list to Palmer’s staff. The office door was not answered.
In a press release, Carolyn Foster said lawmakers are disconnected from their constituents and often pass laws that will not benefit them.
“Alabama’s poor and low-income population make up 47% of the electorate in this state. To our lawmakers, they are invisible people,” she said. “Our lawmakers are disconnected from the realities of people needing health care and food assistance. It is shameful that they willingly push the sick, the hungry, the elderly and the disabled into suffering and possibly death.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gary-Palmer-Protest-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 08:02:11.580191

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs)Housing advocates are urging New Jersey lawmakers to return to Trenton this summer to replenish a fund intended to help produce affordable housing.
The $58.8 billion budget lawmakers passed on June 30 includes a diversion of $125 million away from that fund, leaving just $5 million — an amount advocates say is insufficient to address the state’s affordable housing shortage.
Edward Bethea is chair of the nonprofit Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, a statewide association of community development corporations.
“This could be reversed immediately,” Edward Bethea told reporters Monday. “And it should be reversed immediately so that we can get back to the business of building these units and changing family lives.”
New Jersey faces a deficit of as many as 300,000 affordable housing units, according to Staci Berger, the network’s president and CEO. Matthew Hersh, its vice president of policy and advocacy, said that the decision to redirect funds will have a significant impact on New Jersey.
“The work is about affordable home production, but also about stabilizing neighborhoods and creating other services centered around housing that can help create a community development ecosystem,” Hersh said.
State officials defended the move to divert the funds from the affordable housing fund, noting that the money instead is being used for other housing-related programs, like a down payment assistance program, supportive housing, Medicaid housing assistance, and more. The down payment assistance program will get $40 million in the new budget.
Tyler Jones, a spokeswoman for Gov. Phil Murphy, said the new budget builds on the governor’s prior efforts “with the funding of several initiatives creating pathways to affordable housing.”
“Over the past seven and a half years, the Murphy Administration’s Department of Community Affairs has invested almost $250 million into housing production, supporting the construction of nearly 1,600 affordable housing units. The New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency has also created and preserved more than 30,000 additional affordable housing units,” Jones said.
Criticism remains. Scott Millard, CEO of Passaic County Habitat for Humanity, said the funding diversion will halt previously funded housing development projects, including 144 homes from Habitat for Humanity affiliates across the state.
Berger said affordability will be a central concern for voters as they determine who will become our next governor when Murphy leaves office in January (he cannot seek a third term in November). A new Rutgers-Eagleton poll found that 85% of residents are dissatisfied with the state’s approach to affordability and the cost of living.
“It defies logic and explanation that the Legislature and the governor would take funding that is directly connected to and supportive of creating more affordable homes,” Berger said. “We don’t know why they did this, but we know they are going to hear from us.”

Fulop says that's false.,"A former aide to Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop says he was fired in part for blowing the whistle on unethical behavior. Fulop says that's false. (Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)Jersey City attorneys want a judge to dismiss new claims in a lawsuit filed by an employee who was fired last year during a dust-up over his sister’s controversial campaign to become Missouri’s secretary of state.  
Jonathan Gomez Noriega, a former aide to Mayor Steve Fulop, has made new allegations that his firing was in part because he blew the whistle on what Gomez Noriega calls Fulop’s “improper” push to invest retirement funds in cryptocurrency. Attorneys for Fulop and the city called those allegations “entirely threadbare and implausible.”
“Under even the most liberal construction, the activities Plaintiff describes do not constitute protected ‘whistleblowing activity,’” city attorneys wrote in a 65-page brief filed last week.
Fulop, a Democrat, has said Gomez Noriega was fired because he supported his sister’s “controversial political campaign.” Valentina Gomez, who is known for her anti-LGBTQ+ stances and rhetoric attacking undocumented immigrants, lost her election in Missouri last year and now says she is seeking a House seat in Texas. 
The federal judge overseeing Gomez Noriega’s suit in April dismissed four of the original six counts, then allowed Gomez Noriega to amend his complaint over the city’s objections. The new allegations claim Fulop improperly made a “unilateral” announcement to invest city retirement funds with cryptocurrency without informing members of the board overseeing the retirement system.
Gomez Noriega’s new complaint notes that Fulop and a super PAC supporting his failed bid to become governor this year received $77,000 from the vice president of a cryptocurrency trading platform. The campaign donations “might reasonably be expected to impair (Fulop’s) objective or independence of judgment,” the new complaint says, and could constitute a breach of state ethics law.
Fulop’s team calls those allegations “nonsensical.” Fulop’s announcement was simply that the city was updating the paperwork it needed to invest in Bitcoin funds, not that there would be investments in cryptocurrencies, city attorneys say.
They also note that the political contributions were made over an eight-year period, and Gomez Noriega provides no allegations that “might suggest that these donations had a corrupting influence on Mayor Fulop.”
“That is exactly the kind of unsubstantiated logical leap that federal courts routinely object,” attorneys said in the filing.
An attorney for Gomez Noriega did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Vermont is not preparing fast enough for its changing climate, though there are signals from abnormal precipitation patterns, warmer summers and invasives. 
When is it “too late” for a community that will never return? Perhaps communities have a choice to declare floodplains unsafe for development aside from agriculture and timbering.
Reading accounts of this horrific flood in Texas taking so many children with it, I learned of the several official discussions about installing a flood warning system. It was deemed too expensive. 
Vermont’s government will need to apply measures to adapt to this wetter, warmer future.
I call out the clean heat standard advocates and lobbyists to give time and attention to redesigning where and how we live.
We have time and money to enforce the Global Warming Solutions Act to lower fossil fuel emissions by a few million tons in a world that emits 35 billion.
And, we have time and money to prepare our children and families to adapt to those changes — including more efficient use of energy and agriculture designed to thrive in those changes. 
Housing, education and health care will also succumb to those changes and there is time to adapt.

The Hartland farm store decision highlights a need for Act 250 reform.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Todd Heyman: Vermont planning commissions should not legislate or litigate.","This commentary is by Todd Heyman of Hartland. He is co-owner of Fat Sheep Farm & Cabins, and an Act 250 permit holder.


The Vermont Supreme Court recently ruled that a Sunnymede Farm store and restaurant could open just off I-91 in an area the town of Hartland had designated as rural in its 2017 town plan. The project was granted an Act 250 permit over the appeals of the Hartland Planning Commission and the Two Rivers Ottauquechee Regional Planning Commission. Notably, the Hartland Selectboard, a body of elected officials, did not appeal the permit.
The Court’s decision was based on the inconsistent language in the town plan. In one section, there was language severely curtailing commercial activity in rural areas and, in another, that particular area by the highway was described as suitable for rural business development. The Court held that the inconsistency did not give fair notice to landowners of what was proscribed.

The decision highlights a need for Act 250 reform.
First, Act 250 should not enforce land use rules in plans that have not been individually warned and voted on by the town’s selectboard.
Second, neither regional nor municipal planning commissions should be afforded party status in Act 250 proceedings.
These reforms would promote transparency, eliminate some appeals, increase efficiency and leave land use decisions in the hands of accountable, elected officials. 
The Legislature’s current approach to Act 250 reform is to determine which projects should be spared the full brunt of Act 250 permitting instead of improving the permitting process for all applicants. It’s an unnecessary surrender to the unspoken consensus that the permitting scheme will never work well, and certain projects, like housing, should be exempted from Act 250. 
The Sunnymede case is just one of dozens where lawyers collected hefty fees squabbling over which plan language was meant to be mandatory. These disputes arise almost exclusively in no-zoning towns because zoning ordinances must be warned and voted on by both planning commissions and selectboards. Accordingly, the intended mandatory effect of the ordinances is obvious.
This is good government. Notice should be given for proposed laws that impair property rights so the public can deliberate prior to any vote on the rule. 
Ironically, no-zoning towns express much less interest in regulating development but can hide new land use regulations in large plan documents that address dozens of issues about the town’s future without ever calling attention to the proposed rules in a meeting warning, let alone warning an individualized vote on each proposed rule. Without such protections, lawyers and courts are kept busy deciding which handful of sentences in a hundred-plus page plan are mandatory.
This is bad government. It is undemocratic. 
The Hartland Planning Commission itself, an unelected body, has buried significant changes in land use rules in past proposed plans. The meeting warnings referenced the plan’s various sections without mentioning the specifics of the new rules.
And plans are approved by both the planning commissions and selectboards with a single vote. No rule is guaranteed an individualized vote or debate before its inclusion in the plan. Those missing democratic protections are needed not just for fairness but also better outcomes.
By requiring individualized warnings and votes on the rules, disputes like Sunnymede would be eliminated because the selectboard would have made clear which plan language was mandatory. Eliminating this uncertainty would make Act 250 work better and reduce its deterrent effect on good projects whose principals are wary of the cost and time constraints of Act 250 permitting.
Indeed, because abutting neighbors are given party status, they can (and do) block projects for years in court based on inconclusive language in enormous planning documents. 
But that’s not the only reform needed. Planning commissions should not be afforded party status in Act 250 proceedings. With just a few municipal exceptions, planning commissions are not elected officials who can be replaced by the voters. Nor is there any independent ethical oversight of commission members who are frequently members of the business community. 
For example, the Two Rivers Planning Commission chair is an angus beef producer who operates a restaurant. How could Sunnymede, also an angus beef producer seeking to open its own restaurant in a neighboring town, raise the ethical conflict without antagonizing the commission and risking the project? 
Even if the chair had recused himself (he did not), the staff’s impartiality could also be fairly questioned. Regional planning commissions are small organizations and the relationships between the staff and board tend to be close and familiar.
In addition, staff answer to their board members, and their continued employment depends on their board’s approval of their work. Act 250 applicants should be concerned about these incentives in the absence of any meaningful ethical oversight.
In short, nothing would be lost by limiting planning commissions to proposing rules for selectboard adoption as mandatory, and letting only selectboards decide whether to enforce them in an Act 250 proceeding.
Taxpayer money, tens of thousands in the case of Hartland, was spent by unelected officials fighting over vague plan language that they themselves drafted. The days of scouring enormous planning documents to identify the “mandatory” rules should have ended long before now.

As of Monday, political committees funded largely by businesses had shelled out $330,000 on mailers, texts and digital ads opposing two appointed Democratic state senators: Deb Krishnadasan and Victoria Hunt. The groups hope Republicans can unseat both this fall.
Krishnadasan, who represents the 26th Legislative District, is up against Rep. Michelle Caldier, a veteran lawmaker. Hunt, who moved from the House to the Senate in the 5th Legislative District after the death of Bill Ramos, is facing former state lawmaker Chad Magendanz.  
Those opposing the senators see the two contests as a barometer of whether voters think Democrats overreached this year with taxes. Democrats pushed through $9.4 billion of tax increases to shore up the state’s general fund and another $3.2 billion of hikes for transportation, anchored by a 6-cent per gallon bump in the gas tax. 
The onslaught of negative campaign pieces — coming weeks ahead of the Aug. 5 primary — aims to highlight how the senators voted on taxes and other high-profile issues.
“We don’t need to wait. We can start changing hearts and minds throughout the summer and fall,” said Jim Walsh, chair of the state Republican Party.

 Primary Election
Ballots will be mailed Friday, July 18 for the Aug. 5 primary election.
Across the state, there are 239 contests including races for nine state legislative offices.
The two top finishers in each primary race will advance to the November general election.
You can find more information on the Secretary of State’s website.


Enterprise Washington, which advocates for pro-business policies in Olympia, is funneling money through its political committee, Jobs PAC, to separate committees in each race. The political committee has raised $305,000 this calendar year on top of $138,000 unspent from last year. 
The largest contributions to Jobs PAC in 2025 have come from the Washington State Dental PAC and the Washington Hospitality Association. Other donors include Puget Sound Energy, Koch Industries, Chevron Corp., Associated General Contractors, the Washington Retail Association and Washington Realtors.
Some of the most significant tax increases legislators approved this year fall on businesses, and some Democrats wanted to go further and impose even heftier levies on large companies. 
“This was a tough session for the business community, so it is not surprising that businesses would be participating aggressively this election cycle,” said Nathan Gorton, CEO of Washington Realtors, one of the larger donors to East King County Jobs, a political committee targeting Hunt.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee said the early attacks are needed to overcome negativity toward GOP candidates due to Republican President Donald Trump’s unpopularity in Washington.
“The conservative interests backing Republicans in these races know they’re facing tough headwinds. Which is why they are out early, relentlessly sending spam texts and overflowing mailboxes with negative attacks,” said Katy Ozog, executive director of the Washington Senate Democratic Campaign.
Krishnadasan, of Gig Harbor, is taking the heavier fire thus far, though she did vote against her party’s major tax bills and transportation revenue package. Sound Jobs, backed by Enterprise Washington, had spent $171,311 against her as of Monday.
“My district is the most competitive in the state, and I’m not surprised that Chevron and Koch Industries are spending big to mislead voters,” she said in a statement. “I am the only candidate in this race who will protect against President Trump’s damaging policies, not advocate for them, and that’s why these special interests are attacking me.”
Caldier, also of Gig Harbor, has not been the target of hit pieces. But those will come, she said, as Democrats are determined to hold onto their 30-19 majority in the Senate, 
“I fully assumed I’d be attacked by now,” she said. “I have no intention of being nasty toward Deb at all. I am running to help save our state and that starts with ending the supermajority.”
Hunt, of Issaquah, won her House seat last November with 54% of the vote. She was appointed to the Senate after the session. Unlike her colleague, she did vote for the taxes, and her opponents sent four mailers in four days earlier this month to make that point. East King County Jobs has spent $161,000 against her.
Hunt, in a statement, pushed back on criticism of her tax votes.
“I’m proud of my vote for a budget that balanced billions in difficult cuts with key investments in education and health care. I’ll keep fighting for affordability, opportunity, and to safeguard our rights,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/money-dollars.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 07:05:31.842807

John Hoffman could have been a mass slaughter. 
Police found five firearms in the shooter’s SUV, including assault rifles with a “large quantity of ammunition organized into loaded magazines.” They recovered close to 50 guns from his home. The shooter had a long list of targets. If Hope Hoffman had not called 911, it’s likely more people –– including more of Minnesota’s top elected officials –– would have been injured or killed.  
This tragedy puts into stark relief a rising threat: Our toxic politics combined with easy access to firearms is increasing the risk of political violence and undermining our democratic system. 
The Minnesota attacks are merely the most recent examples of a surge in political violence, including the mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice, the attack at the U.S. Capitol, the assault of Nancy Pelosi’s husband, and two attempted assassinations of President Trump. Political violence is increasing in the United States, and the American public views it as a major problem. 
This rise in political violence coincides with our increasing negative polarization –– how much Americans dislike the political party opposing their own. Although polarization is not a problem unique to the United States, Americans’ feelings of animosity toward members of the opposing political party have increased faster over time than similar democracies. The social media response to the Minnesota attacks demonstrated the ignominious depths of our affective polarization; posts, many rife with misinformation, were primarily focused on whether the shooter was a Democrat or Republican, rather than condemning the violence itself.
This toxic political environment is taking place in a country with high levels of gun violence and easy access to firearms. Americans are 26 times more likely to be killed by gun homicide than people in other high-income countries. We do not have more violent citizens; rather we have gun laws that make it easy for dangerous people to get a gun. 
In Minnesota, you have to obtain a permit to purchase a firearm and/or a permit to carry, but in many states, there are no such requirements. And while federally licensed dealers must conduct background checks on their gun sales, there’s a loophole in many states where dealers at gun shows and online (who are not federally licensed) conduct no background check whatsoever. 
Hortman worked to close that loophole in Minnesota in 2023, but many states continue to have private sales with no check at all. And there is currently a federal concealed carry bill that would usurp the ability of states to regulate the carrying of firearms in their states, and make it even easier for those with bad intentions to transport firearms across state lines.
When a formerly law-abiding citizen radicalizes without showing outward signs, it is challenging to identify him as a person who should not have access to a firearm. This may or may not be the case with Hortmans’ murderer; law enforcement is just beginning its investigation. But in states with extreme risk protection orders, like Minnesota, law enforcement at least has a tool in situations where someone is spiraling out of control. States with stronger gun laws — like background checks on all gun sales, extreme risk protection orders, and assault weapon bans — have lower rates of gun violence. Conversely, states with the weakest gun laws have some of the highest rates. dd
What happened in Minnesota strikes at the very core of our political system. Elected officials must be able to serve the public without fear that they’re going to be gunned down in their homes. Enacting effective public policy, especially in divided government, is challenging in the best of times, let alone under threat of violence. And if potential leaders fear that threat, they may choose not to run and represent their communities in the first place. 
Lax gun laws make political violence that much easier and more deadly, and accordingly, gun safety reform is an essential tool in combating it.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gun-rack-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 07:05:31.842807

But several critics […],"James Uthmeier visits the Dade-Collier Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport with two Florida Highway Patrol troopers, ahead of construction of an immigrant detention facility, via screengrab from his X account.The Key West City Commission’s vote last week to reverse itself and agree to once again enter into a 287(g) agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) came in response to a threat made by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier that failure to do so could lead to their removal from office.
But several critics of the agreement told members of the commission in public comment prior to their vote that they should defer any action, saying they were under no legal obligation to authorize the Key West Police Department to work with ICE.
“287(g) agreements are not mandatory in this state,” said Berbeth Foster, senior staff attorney with Community Justice Project, a Miami racial justice and human rights organization.
“Key West and any city in the state of Florida does not have an obligation to enter into this agreement. So instead, what we’re seeing is the governor and the attorney general using fear and intimidation to force cities across the state to engage in conduct that far exceeds Florida state law requirements.”
After Key West commissioners voted to void the previously agreed-upon contract with ICE on June 30, Uthmeier declared in a social media post: “Key West has made itself a sanctuary city,” which are illegal in Florida. He went on to warn that failure to take corrective action would result in the enforcement of “all applicable civil and criminal penalties, including removal of office by the Governor pursuant to section 908.107, Florida Statutes, and the Florida Constitution.”
Uthmeier also threatened members of the Fort Myers City Council with removal earlier this year after they opposed having their police department from cooperate with ICE. Like Key West officials, they promptly turned around and voted to implement a 287(g) agreement.
Cites are not required to sign 287(g) agreements in Florida
However, in dozens of Florida cities, police have not entered into 287(g) agreements. ICE has links on their website showing the number of participating law enforcement agencies in Florida and the U.S. with such agreements, although it is not completely up to date.Among those that have signed on but are not yet listed on the website is Miami, which enacted its agreement with ICE last month.
Alana Greer is director and co-founder of the Community Justice Project in Miami.
“Despite the tremendous pressure exerted by the governor and AG to strong-arm cities into joining ICE’s deportation machine, over 100 agencies have not signed up,” she told the Phoenix. “No federal or state law requires they join. But that legal truth is not enough, we need courage from elected officials to hold the line for their communities.”
Florida banned sanctuary cities in 2019. The law defines a sanctuary policy as “a law, policy, practice, procedure, or custom adopted or allowed by a state entity or local government entity which prohibits or impedes a law enforcement agency from complying with 8 U.S.C. s. 1373 or which prohibits or impedes a law enforcement agency from communicating or cooperating with a federal immigration agency …”
(8 U.S.C. s. 1373 is  a federal statute that prohibits local and state governments and agencies from enacting laws or policies that limit communication with DHS about “information regarding the immigration or citizenship status” of individuals).
Section 908.104 of the law says that “[c]onsistent with all duties created in state and federal law, state and local law enforcement agencies and any official responsible for directing or supervising such agency shall use best efforts to support the enforcement of federal immigration law.”
Another city in Miami-Dade — South Miami — is involved in a lawsuit against the Ron DeSantis administration regarding the legal requirements for municipalities to participate in such agreements. The city seeks a declaration that not executing a 287(g) agreement does not constitute adopting or having in effect a sanctuary policy.
“The fact that the Legislature required county-level agencies to enter into 287(g) agreements shows that it knew how to enact that requirement if it wanted to,” reads the lawsuit, which was filed on March 27.
“As compelled by applicable interpretive canons … the Legislature’s express specification that a failure to enter into a 287(g) agreement by only operators of county facilities can constitute a sanctuary policy, while failing to make any mention or requirement of municipalities, shows a contrary intention as to municipalities.”
South Miami Mayor Javier Fernández says the purpose of the lawsuit is to allow cities “to have an honest conversation without the fear of retribution and without duress.” It’s important, he said, to talk about implications of such agreements from monetary, liability, and policing perspectives.
“Right now, cities aren’t free to have those conversations without running afoul of what is a very vague statute,” he told the Phoenix last week.
Fernández adds that while he was disappointed Key West City Commissioners opted to execute a 287(g) agreement, he hopes that, if the Second Judicial Court rules in favor of his city, “other cities can weigh the choice Key West was forced to consider without fear and free of duress.”
Who is required by Florida law to work with ICE?
Among the multiple immigration bills filed in the first special session that Gov. DeSantis called for in January was a measure by Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia (SB 14-A) directing that along with each state and county law enforcement agency, “any other law enforcement agency with more than 25 sworn officers or certified law enforcement officers” must enter into agreements with ICE.
However, that particular bill never made it to the floor — it died once House Speaker Daniel Perez and Senate President Ben Albritton immediately gaveled out of that special session.
“That bill language was never reconsidered in the course of any subsequent session,” Fernández said.
What did make it into statute this year was Statute 908.11, which says that the “sheriff or chief correctional officer operating a county detention facility must enter into a written agreement with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement to participate in the immigration program under s 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. s 1357.”
It’s not clear what the attorney general’s opinion is of the Florida cities whose police departments haven’t signed a 287(g) agreement. His office did not return a request for comment.

“This is another legal blow to reproductive privacy and health care privacy for women, and I’m really concerned,” said Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis.

She worries Attorney General Todd Rokita, who has hailed the ruling, will take advantage of it.
The issue started in 2024 when health officials under former President Joe Biden enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy rule to boost protections and  block law enforcement from getting medical records of patients seeking legal abortions or gender-affirming care. 
In June, a federal judge in Texas overturned that rule, finding the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services acted unlawfully when expanding the HIPAA privacy law. 
States Newsroom reported that, without the rule, law enforcement officials in states with abortion bans may issue subpoenas for records related to reproductive health care obtained legally in another state. According to health policy nonprofit KFF, 22 states and the District of Columbia have laws limiting what reproductive health information can be obtained — but others, like Indiana, don’t.
Some states have already attempted to track abortion seekers. 
According to the Associated Press, a suburban Chicago police department allegedly shared data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion. The Illinois secretary of state is investigating the police department. 
“Since Roe (v. Wade) was overturned, patients are rightfully afraid that if their state bans abortion, it may attempt to target or prosecute them for obtaining an abortion in other states. Anticipating this situation, the recently vacated rule enhanced health care data privacy protections against disclosure to law enforcement,” said Amy Myrick, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “While HIPAA still provides basic protections for your health care data, this openly anti-abortion ruling is yet another blow against the basic freedom to make decisions about your own body and health care.”
Abortion in Indiana 
An Indiana Department of Health report released in April showed a total of 146 abortions occurred in 2024 – a 98% decrease from 2022. 
Indiana’s near-total abortion ban, which took effect in August 2023, outlaws abortion except in cases of fatal fetal anomalies and serious health risks to the mother. Victims of rape or incest are also allowed to access abortion care up to 10 weeks post-fertilization. The law mandates that hospitals perform all abortions. While performing an illegal abortion is a felony for doctors in Indiana, women seeking abortions face no criminal penalties. 
FDA-approved abortion pills remain accessible by mail nationwide. 
Indiana law also requires that providers who perform abortions file terminated pregnancy reports with the state health agency. They’re due within 30 days if the patient is 16 or older, and within three days if younger than 16. Each of the reports should include demographic, medical and procedural information. 
In January, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun signed new executive orders on abortion records to ensure the laws are “fully and faithfully executed,” including for terminated pregnancy report submissions. It also required a new IDOH state report, recommended financial penalties for noncompliant hospitals and greater state oversight by health officials. 
Hoosiers traveling to seek care
Illinois — which has protected abortion access as a fundamental right — is a top destination for Hoosiers seeking the procedures. Since Indiana’s abortion ban went into effect, there has been a five-fold increase in patients traveling to Illinois, according to Planned Parenthood of Illinois.
At Planned Parenthood’s Carbondale Health Center, 90% of patients seen are from another state. 
In 2024, 9,500 Indiana residents traveled to nearby states to obtain abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion-rights research and policy group. Principal Federal Policy Adviser Anna Bernstein said the 2024 rule from the Biden administration strengthened privacy protections for patients seeking reproductive health care. 










“Indiana residents are already being denied abortion care in their state — vacating this rule will likely only mean more infringements on their bodily autonomy.”


– Don't forget to add author


“By vacating this rule, Judge (Matthew) Kacsmaryk has removed critical protections for patients seeking abortion care at a time when criminalization of patients and providers is increasing. The 2024 rule prohibited the use and disclosure of protected health information for care that was lawfully provided,” Bernstein said. “Without this rule, patients like those traveling out of state for care could be at greater risk for law enforcement involvement for seeking necessary health care.”
State lawmaker Hamilton said that, as legal rulings come down, doctors fear providing life saving care to women who are pregnant. And as doctors see health care and reproductive deserts grow in Indiana, she feared that women will struggle even more to find emergency care when something goes wrong during pregnancy. 
Indiana University Associate Professor of Clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology Dr. Caroline Rouse said she is concerned about the erosion of reproductive health care privacy laws and thinks it’s important for everyone to spread awareness. She said that a doctor-patient relationship is critical.

“I am very concerned about patients suffering consequences of that and concerned about patients not even seeking the care that they need and suffering the consequences of not getting that care,” she said.
OBGYN Dr. Amy Caldwell said current Indiana law does not give the attorney general grounds to demand records from neighboring states. 
“The intent of overturning laws like this is to scare women,” she said. “Physicians will never turn over a patient’s record unless there is a court order and patients should always feel empowered to access their records.” 
Rokita, meanwhile, has celebrated the ruling and how it impacts Indiana reporting. 
That’s because several doctors performing abortions in Indiana have refused to file terminated pregnancy reports since the federal rule went into effect. Litigation is ongoing. 
“We’re moving forward with our goal to protect life and working to undo the many setbacks created by the Biden administration,” Rokita said in a statement. “We’ve been closely watching the Texas case and updated the Indiana court of the decision there, so we look forward to having a positive outcome in our case. This is a major win for women and for physicians because it would take away an excuse thrown up by abortionists for not complying with state law.

Tom Cotton and Democrat Hallie Shoffner are seeking to represent Arkansas in the U.S. Senate during the 2026 election. (Courtesy photos)Sixth-generation farmer Hallie Shoffner officially launched her campaign against U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton on Tuesday. 
The Democrat and Newport native is challenging the incumbent Republican who’s seeking his third six-year term in the U.S. Senate during the 2026 election. 
Shoffner aims to unseat Cotton and “take on the corrupt political system he’s spent the past ten years rigging against regular people,” according to a press release. 
“As a sixth-generation family farmer, I know what it’s like to have to fight tooth and nail for everything you have, and still get crushed by an economy that’s rigged against you,” Shoffner said.
Noting that Cotton has twice voted against the Farm Bill, Shoffner said she’ll fight for a Farm Bill that gives farmers “room to breathe.” She also argued that Cotton’s tax cuts are for “land barons,” and said the Republican “just blew a massive hole in our national debt.” 
All six members of Arkansas’ federal delegation, including Cotton, voted in favor of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will make permanent 2017 tax cuts and provide billions to carry out the president’s plans to crack down on immigration and increase defense spending. The bill could add $3.4 trillion to deficits over the next decade, according to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.   
“I’ll cut taxes for blue-collar workers, fight to restore Medicaid, save Social Security, cut the deficit, and be radically focused on bringing costs down for regular people,” Shoffner said. “I’ll fight this rigged system every day—Tom Cotton’s the guy who did the rigging.”
Shoffner is a graduate of Newport High School, Vanderbilt University and the Clinton School of Public Service. In addition to running her family farm, she is also the founder and CEO of Delta Harvest, which builds local food infrastructure, supports farmers and brings opportunities back to struggling communities, according to the release. 
Shoffner grew up on her family farm in East Arkansas where she started working in the field with her dad at the age of 10. In February, she and her family decided to sell their 2,000-acre farm due to high input costs and inadequate federal assistance, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. 
“It doesn’t matter if you are a farmer, an auto mechanic, or a single mom taking on a double shift just to make it, if you have to work for a living, you know how hard it is to get by when your own Senator is working against you,” said Shoffner. “I’m not a politician, I’m not much for political parties, and I’ve never run for office in my life—the only thing I ever wanted to do was farm. But if I can’t farm, I’m going to fight.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Cotton officially announced his re-election campaign on Feb. 27, when he asked for support to continue his work “as the conservative voice” for Arkansans. In a campaign video, Cotton acknowledged “times have been tough these last four years.”
“Runaway inflation has pushed Arkansas families to the edge. Prices are too high and paychecks are too small,” he said. “Our southern border was left wide open, our country flooded with more than 10 million illegals, dangerous criminals and deadly drugs.”
With President Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans holding a slim majority in both chambers of Congress, Cotton said “we can turn things around for Arkansas and our nation.” 
“Let’s secure our border, deport criminal illegal aliens and stop the drug traffickers,” he said. “Let’s end wasteful liberal spending, cut your taxes and get inflation under control. Let’s rebuild our military, crackdown on China, stop Iran from getting nukes and always stand with Israel.”
Cotton was born and raised on his family’s cattle farm in Yell County, according to his campaign website. The sixth-generation Arkansan graduated from Dardanelle High School before going to Harvard University and Harvard Law School. 
The Arkansas Republican left law school because of the September 11th attacks and served nearly five years on active duty in the United States Army, according to his Senate website. Cotton completed combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. His military decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Combat Infantry Badge and Ranger Tab. 
Cotton was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014. Arkansas’ junior senator is chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the third-ranking member in the Senate Republican leadership as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. 
In his campaign launch video, Cotton promised to “never back down” as an Arkansas congressman. 
“Together we’ll make Arkansas and our nation stronger and safer,” he said. “So let’s go forward together — strong, confident and resolute. In the defense of our glorious past and our limitless future.”    
All members of Arkansas’ congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders endorsed Cotton in February. Trump also endorsed him earlier this month. 
Cotton has about $8.6 million in his campaign fund, according to the Federal Election Commission. Shoffner’s campaign hasn’t had to file a campaign finance report yet.

This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra of The 19th.  Meet Shefali and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A new federal law that would “defund” Planned Parenthood could gut the system people have used to obtain abortions since the fall of Roe v. Wade, disproportionately closing the clinics in states that have become abortion havens for people living under bans.
Backed by President Donald Trump, the spending law prohibits reproductive health clinics from billing services to Medicaid if they provide or are part of health networks that perform abortions, are nonprofits and receive over $800,000 per year from the federal government. Although that part of the law is blocked for now, Planned Parenthood is gearing up for major financial losses that, unless new funds emerge, could shutter health centers across the country, particularly in states where abortion is legal and Medicaid programs more robust.
The move has been framed by politicians across the spectrum, anti-abortion activists and reproductive health providers alike, as an effort to eliminate a major source of funding for Planned Parenthood, specifically. Abortion opponents have claimed this “defunding” as their biggest victory since the 2022 Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and end federal abortion rights.
Currently, about one-third of all of Planned Parenthood’s revenue comes from federal and state funding; Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, is the biggest single source. Medicaid insures 1 in 5 Americans, and it does not cover abortion unless states allot their own specific funds to do so. But the program remains a major source of income for Planned Parenthood because it covers other services patients might get at clinics such as testing for sexually transmitted infections, breast exams and contraception. If clinics can’t bill any of those services to Medicaid, patients covered through the program will have to go elsewhere for health care — or simply go without.
A federal judge in Massachusetts blocked that part of the law after a legal challenge by Planned Parenthood, which argued it violates the U.S. Constitution’s free speech and due process protections. A hearing in the case will take place later this month. But across the country, Planned Parenthood representatives expressed worry that this relief is temporary at best. Many clinics have already stopped accepting Medicaid. Others are continuing to see patients covered by the program, but refraining from submitting those insurance claims for payment. All are making contingency plans in case they are unable to reenter the Medicaid program.
Many are scrambling to find alternative sources of revenue to stay afloat. Clinics are particularly vulnerable in places where abortion is legal and Medicaid programs receive more state investment. In many of those states — such as Colorado, Maryland, New Mexico and New York — abortion clinics have seen a dramatic influx in out-of-state patients since the fall of Roe. Clinic closures in those places could force patients to travel even farther for abortions, get care later in pregnancy or drive up what patients have to pay. It could also mean more people stay pregnant.
“This just feels like this could be another huge shock to the system,” said Caitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College who has tracked abortion-related travel patterns over the past three years.
Last year alone, 155,000 people traveled to another state for an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. About 1 in 4 abortion patients in Colorado came from another state. In New Mexico, it was 69 percent. More than 7,000 patients traveled to New York, the fourth-largest state by population, for an abortion last year. Thousands more made the journey to Maryland.
Clinic closures would likely create new challenges for those patients, including longer waits and more expensive journeys to find abortions.
“In a lot of states that have received a lot of people traveling from out of state that have become critical, there really is a strain on clinic capacity,” said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at Guttmacher who tracks abortion-related travel patterns. “Clinics have learned to scale up capacity to serve those patients. If there were a significant number of clinic closures, it would really have an impact on people’s ability to get in-person care.”
That’s a looming possibility in New York, where the Planned Parenthood affiliate with 23 health centers could lose about $35 million in federal Medicaid dollars. That’s about a third of the $103 million in operating revenue it reported last year.
Organization leaders are hoping the state government could step in — but if not, most of the affiliate’s clinics could shut down, said Robin Chappelle Golston, who heads Planned Parenthood Empire State Acts, the organization’s advocacy arm. That wouldn’t just affect New Yorkers, she said. Clinics in the state see patients from numerous other states, including hundreds from Texas and thousands from Florida last year.
“It’s just going to make it harder for people to get the care they need. We will have to reduce services and put a burden on other providers,” she said. “You clog up the whole system, where people aren’t able to get care in the time they need it.”
Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountain, which operates clinics in New Mexico and Colorado, is already turning away patients covered by Medicaid. Medicaid covers about a fourth of their patients in each state.
“Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountain has been around for over 100 years. We’re not going to go away,” said Jack Teter, the organization’s vice president of government affairs. “We need our state legislatures to step in.”
In the immediate future, he said, the organization may actually have more availability to see out-of-state abortion patients: there are slots now that would otherwise have gone to people covered by Medicaid, who can no longer get treatment. But he wouldn’t say if the organization might have to scale back if New Mexico and Colorado, which are both fully governed by Democrats, don’t or can’t replace those federal funds.
“These are safe haven states with strong reproductive health care access supporting trifecta governments. If they can’t find 3 or 4 million dollars to replace the loss of federal funding, that’s embarrassing,” he said.
While it’s still not clear how many clinics might close across the country, the consequences could be vast, making the journeys patients must make  to travel for care — already hundreds or in some cases thousands of miles — too arduous to complete. With that, more people may be forced to stay pregnant.
One study, published this June in the American Journal of Public Health, found that the average travel time for an abortion after states began putting near-total bans in place jumped from 2.8 hours to 11.3. And 17 percent of people traveling for an abortion had their procedure at 13 weeks of pregnancy or later, compared to only 8 percent before the end of Roe, a development the researchers attributed to the greater challenges they faced in finding care.
Already, patients crossing state lines for care have had to navigate increasing delays in getting abortions, in part because traveling hundreds of miles for an appointment involves logistics: finding child care, taking time off work or raising the funds necessary to finance a trip.
Planned Parenthood Illinois, which receives about $4 million per year in Medicaid funds, does not immediately anticipate many of its clinics closing, said Tonya Tucker, the organization’s interim CEO. But, she added, clinic closures in other states could mean even more patients traveling to Illinois —  resulting in longer wait times and care that comes later in pregnancy, thus costing more. Already, abortion providers there saw more than 35,000 out-of-state patients last year.
“We have an expectation that people may have to travel farther distances, and how we prepare for that is really important,” said Megan Jeyifo, who runs the Chicago Abortion Fund, one of the largest such funds in the country. “If the safety net is going to continue to shrink in this country and people have less resources, that will mean our costs go up.”
In Illinois, she said, abortion providers and reproductive rights activists are brainstorming ways to undercut potential clinic losses. That could mean expanding the capacity of independent clinics, which already provide a large share of abortions, recruiting more health care providers or leaning on options such as telehealth, which does not require travel and is far cheaper than in-clinic abortion. About 1 in 4 abortions are already performed through telehealth, with half of abortion provided for people who live in states with bans and who receive abortion pills from providers in other states.
But building out those alternatives will require time and resources. Separate from their efforts to cut funding for physical clinics, abortion opponents have been pressing for federal restrictions on abortion medication, including a national ban on telehealth.
“As people’s options get more and more constrained you never know what that one additional obstacle is going to be that says someone is not able to obtain an abortion,” Maddow-Zimet said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_6694-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 07:05:31.842807

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
 The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.










There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has.


– Michael Coen, chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations


Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
 Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.

Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul joined 23 states and the District of Columbia Monday in suing the Trump administration for withholding $6.8 billion meant for six U.S. Department of Education programs, which help support English language learners, migrants, low-income children, adult learners and others. 
The funds, approved in the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act 2025 and signed into law on March 15, are typically distributed to states by July 1. However, the Department of Education notified the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction as well as other state education agencies on June 30 that they would be withholding the funds. 
“Depriving our schools of critical resources is bad for our schools, bad for students, and bad for Wisconsin,” Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement. “This unlawful funding freeze should be stopped.”
The Wisconsin DPI said in a statement that the federal agency gave no specific explanation for the action. Instead, the U.S. Department of Education said that “decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year” and “accordingly, the Department will not be issuing Grant Award Notifications obligating funds for these programs on July 1 prior to completing that review. The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.” 
The withholding of funds comes as the Trump administration continues to pursue closing the Department of Education with a plan to lay off more than 1,000 agency employees and resume drastically cutting the agency after getting the greenlight from the U.S. Supreme Court Monday. The Trump administration has also withheld other funds this year, including for grants for mental health in schools. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement about the review of education funding that “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.” 
The multi-state lawsuit argues that the freeze of the $6.8 billion violates federal laws and regulations that authorize and fund the programs, federal laws, including the Antideficiency Act and Impoundment Control Act, that govern the federal budgeting process and the constitutional separation of powers doctrine and the Presentment Clause. 
The coalition of states is requesting that the court provide declaratory relief by finding the freeze is unlawful and offer injunctive relief by requiring the release of the funds. 
Over $72 million is being withheld from Wisconsin. Without the funding, school districts face funding shortfalls for programs that have already been planned, DPI may have to lay off 20 employees and programs at Wisconsin’s technical colleges are in trouble with $7.5 million in adult education grants being withheld.
State Superintendent Jill Underly said in a statement that Wisconsin schools depend on the federal funding distributed through an array of programs to support students. There are five programs affected: Title I-C, which supports migrant education, Title II-A, which goes towards teacher training and retention, Title III-A, which supports education of English language learners, Title IV-A, which is for student enrichment and after-school programs and Title IV-B, which supports community learning centers.
“Make no mistake, stopping this money has had and will continue to harm our families and communities,” Underly said. 
Wisconsin schools have received funding through these federal programs for decades to help carry out related programs. According to DPI, federal funding makes up about 8% of funding for Wisconsin schools with nearly $850 million coming into the state. 
Sen. Tammy Baldwin alongside 31 other U.S. senators penned a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and Education Secretary Linda McMahon, calling on them to release the money. 
“This delay not only undermines effective state and local planning for using these funds to address student needs consistent with federal education law, which often takes place months before these funds become available, but also flies in the face of the nation’s education laws which confers state and local educational agency discretion on permissible uses of federal formula grant funds,” the senators wrote. “We are shocked by the continued lack of respect for states and local schools evidenced by this latest action by the administration.”
“It is unacceptable that the administration is picking and choosing what parts of the appropriations law to follow, and you must immediately implement the entire law as Congress intended and as the oaths you swore require you to do,” the lawmakers said. 
The lawmakers also said the “review” being undertaken by the administration appears to be intentional to delay the funding and will result in budget cuts for schools. They said it is happening “with no public information about what the review entails, what data the administration is examining or a timeline for such review.”

An email message from the agency about the tax cut bill that President Donald Trump signed July 4 has drawn sharp criticism. (Photo by Michael Vi/Getty Images)Retired professor Larry White says the email message he got on July 4 from the Social Security Administration was unlike any he’s ever seen from the agency.
“The Social Security Administration (SSA) is celebrating the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the email message began — using the official name of the massive legislation signed by President Donald Trump that cuts taxes and also slashes spending on Medicaid and SNAP, along with making numerous other policy changes.
White, 71, who lives in Middleton, Wisconsin, has been getting Social Security Administration email since he retired from the Beloit College psychology faculty in 2019. But until the July 4 message, he said, every single one has been straightforward, factual — and nonpolitical.
The message included a misleading description of one provision in the new law. The Social Security Administration later published a correction.
That alone angered White. But that the message was sent at all was just as irritating, he told the Wisconsin Examiner.
The email, including a quote from Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano, “appeared to value currying favor with the president over telling Americans the truth,” White said. “I want our federal agencies to be independent, nonpartisan offices that act with integrity and serve the public, not the president.”
The Social Security message claims that the legislation “ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits…”
“This is a historic step forward for America’s seniors,” Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano stated.
  A screenshot of the Social Security Administration message sent to the agency’s email list early July 4, 2025.
As was soon widely reported, however, the message itself was off the mark.
“I was surprised to see SSA send this out as an email to such a large list since this seems more about politics than anything specific to the program,” said J. Michael Collins, a household economics expert at the University of Wisconsin. Collins directed a Social Security research center at the UW until the Trump administration shut it down earlier this year.
The actual change that the message refers to is to income taxes paid by all people 65 or older with incomes $75,000 a year or less for single filers and $150,000 a year or less for couples — regardless of whether they’re collecting Social Security or not, Collins explained.
While the message appears to single out Social Security income, “there is no new exemption of SSA income from federal income taxes, just a new deduction for all people 65+ regardless of income source,” Collins told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message.
For people who are 64 or younger and who get income from Social Security, there’s no comparable tax cut, he added.
To be sure, the reduction does give some help to taxpayers 65 or older who collect Social Security.
 A 2022 IRS tax tip explains that half of Social Security income is taxable for  a single person whose income is $25,000 to $34,000 and for a married couple filing jointly whose income is $32,000 to $44,000.
For a single person with income over $34,000 or a married couple with income over $44,000, 85% of their Social Security income is taxable.
Social Security beneficiaries with incomes below the $75,000 or $150,000 ceiling will get relief from those tax bills — along with everyone else 65 or older whose income also falls below those limits.
The tax break also lasts just a few years, ending in 2028 — stretching the claim that qualifying beneficiaries “will no longer” pay income taxes.
The email message produced a sharp blowback.
“I was appalled — it was really unprecedented,” Nancy Altman, president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told the Wisconsin Examiner in a phone interview. “They’ve taken an agency that’s supposed to be above politics and made it an arm of propaganda.”
Altman recalled that when Social Security checks were mailed in October 1972, President Richard Nixon suggested including an insert in which he could take credit for a benefit increase — even though he had initially opposed it. The commissioner at the time, Robert Ball, threatened to resign if Nixon followed through, and Nixon backed off, Altman said.
As originally worded, the email message appeared to suggest two separate tax cut provisions — one for Social Security recipients 65 and older and one for others:
“The new law includes a provision that eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries, providing relief to individuals and couples. Additionally, it provides an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older, ensuring that retirees can keep more of what they have earned.”
On July 7, the Social Security Administration added a correction and changed the second sentence in that paragraph to, “It does so by providing an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older…”
The correction was previously reported by HuffPost reporter Arthur Delaney.
The morning that he received the Social Security message, White, the retired Beloit professor, wrote back to Bisignano directly — guessing at a direct email address for the Trump-appointed Social Security Commissioner.
“Commissioner Bisignano, When did the Social Security Administration become so blatantly political? I thought government agencies like the USPS were supposed to just go about their business from one administration to the next, but clearly that’s not the case with the SSA. You have become an unabashed mouthpiece for Trump. Shame on you!”
“I was upset that the head of a major federal agency would act in a way that undermines the public’s trust,” White told the Wisconsin Examiner.
“For years, Trump has expressed contempt for America’s once-revered institutions — courts, universities, the press, medical experts, climate scientists, long-time allies abroad … the list is a long one,” White added. “Trump wants to diminish any group or individual who questions his aims or methods.”
The email message appears to play directly to that characteristic of the president, he said, and White fears that will diminish the agency in the public eye.
“What upsets me is that the commissioner of the SSA foolishly wrote a letter that will prompt millions of Americans to question the integrity of the SSA,” White said. “It takes years for an organization to build up a good reputation, but it can be fatally damaged almost overnight.”

In June, a six-person jury will decide whether a political action committee defamed two Republican legislators in campaign materials. 
The post Jury trial dates set in Wyoming Freedom Caucus PAC defamation case appeared first on WyoFile .","One year after two Sweetwater County lawmakers filed a defamation suit against a Wyoming Freedom Caucus-affiliated political action committee, a jury trial has been scheduled in the case.  
In June, a six-person jury will decide whether WY Freedom PAC defamed Rock Springs Republican Reps. J.T. Larson and Cody Wylie when it sent text messages and mailers to voters calling a vote on a 2024 budget amendment a vote to remove former President Donald Trump from the presidential ballot. 
The PAC launched in 2023 to support the hard-line Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which won control of the Wyoming House in November. Among the PAC’s targets were Rock Springs Republicans Larson and Wylie. In their complaint, the two lawmakers allege that the PAC knew its statements were false and, therefore, made them with actual malice — a legal standard in defamation cases involving public figures or officials. 
While the two lawmakers ultimately fended off Freedom Caucus-backed challengers in the primary election, they argue in the complaint that the PAC’s statements were especially damaging in a conservative state like Wyoming, where “support for Trump is so strong … that whether one supports Trump has become a proxy for whether a person is a true Republican.”
Attorneys for the PAC, meanwhile, have accused Wylie and Larson of “seeking to punish and censor criticism of their records as legislators and to profit from their public services.”
The PAC also argues that the mailers and text messages do not constitute defamation and “were made in the course of political campaigning, where imaginative expressions and hyperbole are at their zenith.” 
Outside of legal proceedings, Freedom Caucus lawmakers have defended the mailers, calling the complaint “lawfare.” 
The lawsuit, filed in July 2024, included a request for a jury trial, which is scheduled to span five days starting on June 15, 2026, according to a scheduling order by District Court Judge Richard L. Lavery.

How we got here
The Wyoming Legislature has never in its history considered, debated, nor voted on any proposal to remove President Donald Trump from the ballot in any election, in any state. 
Campaign mailers and text messages stating otherwise referred to a vote on a budget bill footnote, WY Freedom PAC Chairman Kari Drost previously told WyoFile. 
In recent years, lawmakers have regularly clashed over which elected officials should have the authority to represent the state’s interest in litigation. The debate reignited in the 2024 budget session after Secretary of State Chuck Gray joined Ohio and Missouri’s Republican secretaries of state in filing an amicus brief that advocated overturning a Colorado court’s decision to remove Trump from that state’s ballot because of his role in inciting the Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol. 
The Joint Appropriations Committee responded by adding a footnote to the budget limiting the secretary of state’s ability to sue on Wyoming’s behalf. 
“No funds shall be appropriated under this section shall be expended without specific legislative authorization for the secretary of state or the office of the secretary of state to initiate any litigation or participate in any litigation initiated in a court outside of Wyoming in which the state, the secretary of state or the office of the secretary of state is not a named party,” the proposed language read. 
The footnote was motivated by protecting the separation of powers and ensuring the governor — the state’s chief executive — remained the one office with the authority to speak on behalf of Wyoming in a courtroom, some lawmakers argued. That included Clark Stith, who lost his reelection bid in August and is now counsel for Larson and Wylie. 
Freedom Caucus members, however, argued that Gray’s office needed the ability to act quickly. The footnote was ultimately left out of the final budget bill passed by both chambers, but was portrayed by the PAC’s mailers as a vote for or against Trump being on the ballot. 
“[He] voted with the RADICAL LEFT to remove President Trump from the ballot,” a postcard targeting Wylie stated. A similar mailer aimed at Larson accused him of voting “NO to KEEP President Trump on the ballot this fail.” 
What now?
In March, Judge Lavery ruled that the case could continue, rejecting a motion to dismiss the matter entirely, according to reporting by the Rocket Miner. 
“Defendant did not merely misrepresent Plaintiffs’ views or fail to state the whole truth. Defendant fabricated a putative ‘vote’ on an issue that never came before the Legislature and placed it in a list of votes on other topics of legislation,” the ruling stated.
Lavery did, however, dismiss plaintiff’s “false light” claim, which is a more obscure privacy law than defamation. It deals with communications placing someone in a false light, among other things.  
From here, both parties will begin preparing for trial via a formal process known as discovery, which involves exchanging information about witnesses and evidence.

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images)The Idaho Public Safety Communications Commission on July 10 approved a $15 million grant to modernize the state’s emergency response system. 
The money will go toward moving Idaho’s decades-old analog 911 infrastructure to a secure, digital network called Next Generation 911, according to a press release from the Office of Emergency Management. 
“We are proud to have been part of the process in developing a strategy to bring Next Generation 911 to Idaho,” Commission Chairman and Payette County Sheriff Andy Creech said in the release. “This transition will save lives and strengthen the connection between 911 callers and our law enforcement, fire and EMS teams. It’s a major step forward in ensuring every Idahoan has access to fast, reliable emergency response.”

The more-advanced system will allow dispatch centers to receive real-time mobile location data, text messages, photos, videos, and live call transcription, the release said. The system would also include the technology and connectivity needed to route calls based on an exact location, including specific rooms in large buildings. 
The system, called NG911, is built to handle call surges during disasters, the release said. 
The grant will go toward a phased implementation to bring online the 42 of Idaho’s 44 counties that are participating in the grant program. Idaho Public Safety Communications Commission 911 Program Manager Eric Newman told the Idaho Capital Sun that the implementation should take about 18 months. 
The funding comes through the Emergency Communications Grant Fee, a 25-cent surcharge on phone bills. 
The commission also approved a $1.33 million grant to support Geographic Information System projects in communities across Idaho to help integrate with NG911. The funds will help create a four-person team to work directly with counties throughout the state, including the 32 that do not have a GIS professional on staff, the release said. 
The commission and the Idaho Office of Emergency Management “will work closely with counties and emergency response partners to support implementation, training, and public education throughout the rollout process.”

Why not fight for every federal dollar Wyoming can get to help ease the state's K-12 burden, columnist Kerry Drake asks.
The post Trump administration withholding school funding angers districts but not Degenfelder appeared first on WyoFile .","On July 1, the U.S. Department of Education didn’t give Wyoming nearly $25 million in congressionally approved federal funds, which left all 48 school districts in the state scrambling to find money to pay teachers, run programs and buy instructional materials that were already budgeted.

Opinion

But the chaos caused by President Donald Trump’s administration doesn’t seem to have Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder the least bit concerned. Her acceptance of the situation proves she’s a loyal foot soldier in the president’s campaign to abolish the federal Department of Education, but it shouldn’t put her on an automatic path to reelection.
“While we do not yet know the details of this review of funds, President Trump’s education priorities are Wyoming’s priorities, and I continue to support his leadership,” Degenfelder said in a statement to the Wyoming Tribune Eagle.
Degenfelder’s belief that we should accept whatever Trump says is good for Wyoming — even if it’s nothing — isn’t leadership, it’s just political posturing. And we do know many of the details about how these funds were snatched away from states last minute under the guise of a “review,” and how their loss will impact students and educators.
For starters, the $25 million for Wyoming — part of the national $6.2 billion for five educational grant programs — was already in the budget Trump signed. All states will be impacted by this decision. Not delivering those funds and ignoring the will of Congress is a travesty, another blatant attempt by the president to skirt the rules.
States will be expected to find their own funding for grant programs to support professional development of teachers, English learners, academic enrichment and student after-school and summer programs.


These are all successful long-term programs that won congressional approval because they have the backing of educators, parents and communities.
If Degenfelder truly does not realize the impact of this funding loss, especially to the state’s rural schools, she should study several sources that explain it in detail. One is the education policy group New America, which noted red states that have heavily supported Trump are actually more negatively impacted than blue states.
“The loss of these funds will significantly impact school communities, and the impact will be much greater on students and families in certain school districts — particularly high-need districts, often in Republican-leaning areas,” New America concluded.
Of the 100 school districts that would see the most drastic losses per pupil, 91 are heavily concentrated in Republican-represented congressional districts. School districts with high poverty rates above 25% will lose more than five times as much per pupil as low-poverty districts. Districts with a majority of students of color will see 50% bigger cuts than majority-white school districts.
Wyoming has two school districts in the top 100 that stand to lose the most in per-pupil funding if the federal money continues to be withheld for the 2025 fall semester.
One is Fremont County School District 38 in Arapahoe on the Wind River Indian Reservation. It has a 25.5% poverty rate, with 98% students of color. The second is rural Big Horn County School District 4 in Basin.
Why isn’t Degenfelder on the phone with the White House, demanding to know why students at two Wyoming school districts are on a list with 98 others that aren’t being treated fairly by the feds?
Another area of concern for Wyoming is the threat posed to after-school programs like the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, which have 35 chapters operating in Wyoming. The national group’s CEO, Jim Clark, told Axios more than 900 clubs could be forced to shut their doors, and club sites and camps “could shutter mid-season — upending care for working parents and leaving kids without critical safety nets.”
Wyoming has myriad K-12 public school funding woes, including a projected $686 million deficit in the School Foundation Program by the 2029-30 biennium, huge residential property tax breaks that will harm education and a court decision that the state is unconstitutionally underfunding schools. Wyoming voters need confidence that state and federal dollars for education are being wisely spent.
A superintendent of public instruction should fight tooth and nail to make sure Wyoming receives the $24.5 million that school districts were told by the feds was coming. It’s unacceptable to simply act like, because we’re an ultra-red state, we have to bow to Trump’s decision, especially if it means all of that funding goes away. 
Degenfelder has acted like a major part of her job is to compliment Trump at every turn. It’s not what we elected her for. 
What are we to make of Degenfelder putting out a press release on Jan. 20, congratulating Trump on his inauguration?
“Wyoming is ready to partner with his administration to fight for families, protect parental rights, and empower the next generation,” said Degenfelder. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re confident America will continue to embrace bold ideas and strong values. Congratulations, Mr. President — Wyoming stands with you!”
In March, as part of her “official duties,” Degenfelder went to the White House to watch Trump sign his executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.
“This restructuring will make sure that funding reaches our classrooms,
benefiting students and educators first, instead of being absorbed by the
bureaucratic layers in Washington, D.C.,” she told the Casper Star-Tribune.
We know Degenfelder can do more than kiss the ring of the Republican president. The last time I recall she really got worked up, it was to announce she’d rejected $2.2 million a year in USDA funds for a program to ensure poor students could eat when they were out of school in the summer.
“I will not let the Biden administration weaponize summer school lunch programs to justify a new welfare program,” she said. “Thanks, but no thanks. We will continue to combat childhood hunger the Wyoming way.”
Arguing against feeding kids because it’s “welfare” was the nadir of Degenfelder’s first term. Still, maybe she could learn from that embarrassing experience and fight for a good cause, like not backing down until the Trump administration explains why it’s short-changing poor school districts in Arapahoe and Basin, and gives Wyoming all the money it promised.

[…],"As federal aid ran out, advocates called on lawmakers to fund the Child Care Counts program using state dollars, as Evers proposed. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)This summer Democratic  and Republican legislators along with the Gov. Tony Evers participated in closed-door negotiations to come up with  the 2025-27 state budget. All of the  parties involved are touting the budget as a historic advance for children and patting themselves on the back for compromising with each other and the work they accomplished. In other words, they played well in the sandbox together. While yes, the state budget has never included funding for child care in its history, as we were one of only six states that didn’t, crowing about it now is kind of like touting the fact that you’ve just changed a diaper for the first time when your child is 2 years old. It’s not something to brag about, and the new state  budget is nothing to  brag about either.  
On the surface, as you read the claims about historic investments in child care and K-12 schools, you might think the budget really solved some big problems. Take Evers’ statement celebrating “Over $330 million to support Wisconsin’s child care industry and help lower child care costs for working families, a third of which is in direct payments to providers.” That means only $110 million is to continue the direct investment to all 4,700 eligible regulated child care programs. The original amount for this program was $480 million. Child care is receiving less than 25% of the requested amount. You might have  surmised from Evers’ victorious statement that parents will see a decrease in tuition costs with the new budget. However, the opposite is going to be occurring, and tuition increases will start in August. The $110 million will cause child care rates to increase next month because the new state investment  is less than a third of what Child Care Counts, funded through the American Rescue Plan Act, originally provided. 
The purpose of that money was to stabilize a field that had been declining for decades. It  increased teachers’ wages while holding down tuition costs for parents. It worked. The data showed a decline in closures and it raised the average child care educator’s wage from $11 an hour to $13 an hour in Wisconsin. (In our state, over 50% of early child care teachers have some college education or degree, with an average of 10 years experience.)
This month the ARPA funds run out, and for the past few years, knowing the federal funding would be ending, families, child care providers, and businesses have been advocating for the state to fill the gap and to subsidize child care. We know that for every $1 a state invests in early childhood education, the rate of return is between $10-$16.  Not only does quality early child care give children an opportunity for greater success as adults, it also supports our workforce, families and the economy. 
Regardless of the research and well-being of children, the gatekeepers of our tax dollars on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee deleted Evers’ $480 million direct state investment budget request for child care. Instead, child care funding was determined behind closed doors with Senate Minority Leader Diane Hesselbein and Evers in one corner and Rep. Vos and Senate Majority Leader Devin Lemahieu in the other. It should be noted that no one in that  space is considered an expert in child care policy. What came out of this room was a compromise for the sake of compromise.  
The $110 million for child care won’t come from state dollars. It’s the interest that has accrued on the federal ARPA funds. It will be allocated directly to child care providers over the next 11 months, until June of 2026. It comes to about 70% less than the original amount paid through  CCC. This is why, starting in August, there will be significant closures of child care centers and home daycares in rural areas of the state — already considered a child care desert. Tuition will increase at the child care operations that try to stay open. So no, working families will not “see a decrease in childcare costs” as stated by Evers.  
And when the $110 million ends next year, there is nothing to replace it. The Wisconsin Legislature will gavel out in March and not gavel in until January of 2027, as legislators will be campaigning the rest of 2026. There won’t be an opportunity to pass emergency legislation  funding child care. Rates will increase again and closures will continue. 
The remainder of the $330 million in child care funding in the new state budget is for several new programs. A $66 million state investment for 4-year-olds to access “school readiness” in their child care program. This will help parents as the state will pay for their “preschool” time, but it replaces tuition for part of the school day. Child care programs that have school districts with all-day, free 4K will likely find it almost impossible to compete with public schools when they still need to charge for the remainder of the day plus wrap-around care. 
In addition, there is a $28 million pilot project to deregulate the child care field, which ends in July 2027. This move comes directly from the Republicans’ playbook. The pilot project will incentivize providers to increase their ratios, meaning more children per teacher, lower quality and safety for children and more stress on teachers. 
Another harmful policy in the new budget is that 16-year-olds are now allowed to be assistant teachers and count as adults in the ratio. Coupled with the pilot project mentioned above, this means a classroom of 14 toddlers can be supervised by one 18-year-old and one 16-year-old. This reduces the quality, safety, care and education for the children in our programs. Recall that while these decisions were being made behind closed doors, there were no experts in child care policy in the room. This policy was made without consideration of our state accreditation program, YoungStar, and our national accreditations. Any program that participates in the pilot project will no longer qualify to be accredited. And in Wisconsin, accreditation is not just a certificate to state you are following high safety standards, but our YoungStar program is tethered to our Wisconsin Shares (subsidy for child care). Programs with a five or four-star rating receive a bonus subsidy rate. It can mean a considerable loss of funding for providers to participate in the new pilot project.  
The politicians who wrote the budget deal behind closed doors neglected to consider the increased cost or loss of insurance for providers when we increase the teacher-to-child ratio and when we allow 16-year-olds to count as adults. 
The same group of non-experts also decided to allow policies that, in 2023, were already proposed and had failed to become law due to the overwhelming outcry from families, providers and the medical field against a policy that reduces quality and safety for our children. The state is  throwing millions of dollars in the garbage for these policies, which won’t benefit child care programs and will cause actual harm to Wisconsin children. 
Enacting policies like these without holding hearings raises the question: Who is representing us? The public already overwhelmingly said no to these policies two years ago. Furthermore, funding for child care is one of the top priorities that the JFC heard from voters throughout the state at budget listening sessions. Surveys show that the majority of both Republican and Democratic constituents support funding early child care. The only real compromise made in this budget was the compromise of safety and quality of our youngest children in the state.
Wisconsin’s K-12 budget
So how did school-age children fare in the state budget? Again, we are reading about record-setting investments in schools, along with the biggest investment our state has ever made for children with disabilities. Evers proclaimed that the new budget  “secures the largest increase to special education reimbursement rate in state history.”  You might think, great, finally children with disabilities will receive the support and resources they need. But you would be wrong. Evers’ budget request was for a 90% reimbursement for children with disabilities. After all, 90% reimbursement is the amount that Wisconsin voucher and charter schools have already been receiving for children with special needs. Unfortunately, the new budget allows public schools a maximum of 42% in 2026 and 45% in 2027 reimbursement, which is a far cry from the 90% request or from the 60% rate of the 1980s. Yes, the increase in this budget is technically the largest increase in recent years, but it is still miles away from the finish line. 
To make matters worse, the budget also provided a $0 per-pupil increase in general aid funding to public schools; however, a provision was placed in the budget paperwork that guaranteed voucher and charter schools would receive additional funding for their general aid in the budget. I can’t recall a year when no new general funding was provided in a budget to public schools in Wisconsin. Last year Wisconsin saw a record number of public schools go to referendum to squeeze additional funding from their communities to compensate for the lack of state and federal funding. Under the new budget, we will see another record number of schools going to referendum next year. We will also likely see more schools close, specifically in rural, poorer areas where the communities cannot be squeezed any more than they already have been. As you can imagine, this budget will only continue to widen the education gap in quality between the wealthy and the poor.  
Not to be all doom and gloom, there was one category of children that fared quite well with the new budget: our juvenile offenders. The budget will invest $1 million per juvenile offender. Yes, $1 million per kid. Remember when it was mentioned that investing in our youth early on saves us tenfold later on? The children in our juvenile justice systems are children who were not given the opportunity for quality early child care, children who were raised in poverty, children who have been abused, children who experience trauma, children with mental health issues. 
The children in our juvenile systems are those who have been failed by our state. Their families could not afford child care, so they were shuffled from one person to another. They lived with violence and addiction in their homes. And when they got to school at age 5, they were already on a trajectory of despair; the school systems cannot afford to provide all the services and support these children need, especially for those who have suffered trauma at an early age. 
Our new state budget only prioritizes these children once they are ready to be locked away. 
Unfortunately the hype about Wisconsin making record investments in our children is terribly overblown. Instead, the truth of the matter is that we are putting in the minimum, and this budget keeps us on the lowest tier as a state for investment in our public schools and our young children compared to other states. Meanwhile, we continue to be among the biggest spenders  on our juvenile offenders. 
Our political leaders have misled us.
I don’t think most Wisconsinites care whether their representatives can compromise or not. I think we would all rather have elected politicians who will actually represent us with integrity.  Represent us with values that prioritize our children, families, workforce and our economy. This is our common humanity. We can stop generational poverty. We can stop children from going hungry, we can support children who have been abused and neglected, and we can give children a chance in life. But we just made the choice not to do that.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state leaders and Democratic lawmakers warned of the budgetary impacts from the federal tax break and spending cut bill in the months leading up to its passage, saying it will devastate the state’s Medicaid program, drastically reduce nutritional assistance for families and blow a hole in the budget that the state can not absorb.
The bill, signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, includes trillions of dollars of tax cuts, temporary tax deductions for overtime and tipped income and about $170 billion for increased immigrant detention and deportations.
It also slashes spending for social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps — programs that are a cost share between states and the federal government — and rolls back Biden-era clean energy tax incentives.
Now that the bill is law, Colorado leaders are parsing the language to better understand the fallout. It could reduce state revenue by hundreds of millions of dollars per year.

One state lawmaker who helps write the budget says state leaders have no more room to trim around the margins and predicts they will be forced to make cuts in core areas of spending.
“We will have to see to what extent we need changes in our law to be responsive to what we’re seeing coming in that bill. And each of the different agencies (are) going through that bill now trying to figure out exactly the answer to that question,” Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat who sits on the Joint Budget Committee, said.
The goal is to figure out what needs to be addressed now — potentially through a special legislative session or when the Legislature reconvenes next January — and what can wait.
“Governor Polis has been open about the sad reality that the state can’t make up for the funding that President Trump and Republicans are taking away from Coloradans,” Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman wrote in an email. “The governor has previously indicated we may need to reconvene the General Assembly to deal with the terrible impacts from the bill, and we are still reviewing the impacts of this new law to evaluate next steps, including a potential special session.”
Many of the law’s provisions around Medicaid, such as increased eligibility checks, new work requirements and changes in the provider tax rules, do not go into effect for more than a year. But state officials predict they will need to hire thousands more employees to implement the new bureaucratic processes.
The Kaiser Family Foundation predicts that federal spending on Medicaid in Colorado will drop between $11 billion and $18 billion over the next decade.
In a post to X on Monday, the House Republican caucus rejected the claim that the federal bill has unnecessary cuts to Medicaid.
“The so-called cuts refer to a change in how much the federal government contributes. It does not mean a reduction in the quality of care or access to Medicaid,” the post says. “If the state reprioritized its spending, it could easily fill the gap left by a smaller federal match while avoiding any impact on patients.”
Democrats in the state Legislature control strong majorities in the House and Senate.
The Colorado Fiscal Institute estimates that the Medicaid cuts will cost the state about $660 million, based just on the tally of people who may lose coverage, and not other administrative costs.
“I think it’s really hard for people to see this really big bill and understand that it is not going to immediately have an impact, but when it does, it’s going to be really terrible,” said Caroline Nutter, CFI’s legislative and policy manager.










There will be cuts to real services that people expect.


– Rep. Shannon Bird, member of the Colorado Joint Budget Committee


This year, lawmakers worked to craft and pass a state budget that made up a $1.2 billion hole, largely caused by ballooning costs for Medicaid and other state programs, as well as slowing inflation. They paused or eliminated new programs, shifted spending timelines for transportation projects and restricted new spending. The next budget, which will face the same issues as this year’s compounded with the federal spending bill impact, will be much more difficult to write.
“There will be cuts to real services that people expect,” Bird said. “A lot of what we were able to cut last year were programs that I wouldn’t say were the most crucial for people getting mental health care or access to regular health care. I think that this round of cuts this year will be cutting into key programs that people actually depend upon.”
Bird said there are no obvious places in the state budget to cut.
“If you cut (the Department of) Corrections, that could be devastating. If you cut the courts, then that’s people’s access to justice. That would be devastating. If you cut child welfare, that’s hurting kids,” she said. “But these are the questions we’re going to have to be addressing. And these are the cuts I don’t want to make.”
TABOR limitations
Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican who also sits on the JBC, said that Colorado’s budgetary challenges predate the federal bill.
“The problem is that Democrat lawmakers and the Governor have been on a spending spree for years with hardworking Coloradans required to pay the bill,” she said. “My strategy remains the same: to protect and fund critical priorities such as health care, public safety and education. In the short term, it’s time to ground the kids and take away the credit cards. In the long term, we need to get a clear understanding of what (the bill) does, instead of just attempting to scare people to death.”
Joshua Mantell, director of government affairs at the left-leaning Bell Policy Center, said there is “very little margin” for the state to pick up costs of federal cuts. He attributed this to the limitations of the Colorado Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, a constitutional amendment that requires the government to return money to taxpayers when revenue exceeds a cap determined by inflation and population growth and mandates voter approval for new taxes.
“Unlike other states, which have the ability to balance tax revenue and spending, we only have one lever that we can push in Colorado, and that is to cut spending,” Mantell said.
Mantell suggested that lawmakers should consider changing the tax code in Colorado to increase taxes on the wealthy, better situating the state budget. But he added that TABOR limits most revenue-increasing steps that can be taken.
“We really need to be thinking about whether we need to ask the wealthy to pay a little bit more in taxes to be able to manage these cuts that are coming in, and ensure that Colorado is not being dictated to by the federal government and the Trump administration on what to do,” Mantell said. “We need to be able to chart our own path for the people in this state.”

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely | West Virginia Watch)A new Family Treatment Court launched in Cabell County on Monday with the goal of helping parents in child abuse and neglect cases get help for their substance use disorder then safely reunify with their children.
West Virginia’s foster care system is overwhelmed, and most children enter the system due to abuse and neglect and parental substance abuse. 
“Children are separated from their parents. Parents struggle to find the way back, and too often, this cycle repeats,” said Sixth Circuit Judge Sean “Corky” Hammers, who volunteered to preside over the Family Treatment Court.
“But today in Cabell County, we say enough. The Family Treatment Court is here to break that cycle,” he continued. “Keep in mind, this court is not about punishment. It’s about rebuilding.”
The voluntary Family Treatment Court Program offers 24/7 support for parents as they navigate recovery and work towards reunification with their children in the foster care system. It includes intensive case management, parenting services, housing referral assistance and more for a period of typically nine months with continued support.
“It takes strength to admit they need help, and determination to stay the course,” Hammers said. “This court will support that journey every step of the way, with treatment, accountability, guidance and grace.”
Cabell County — previously referred to as “ground zero of the state’s opioid epidemic” — has West Virginia’s second highest number of child abuse and neglect cases.
Cabell Family Treatment Court coordinator Clarissa Mills-Pyles said, “Cabell County needs the services of a Family Treatment Court,” said 
It’s the 14th Family Treatment Court in West Virginia. The courts, which serve 18 counties, have served 635 parents and 887 removed children. They have graduated 280 participants so far, with 418 children reunified with their families.
Children in child abuse and neglect cases typically spend around 18 months in West Virginia foster care; the family treatment programs reduce that time to a little more than 10 months. Twelve percent of the children have re-entered foster care within two years. 
Parents in the Family Treatment Court undergo frequent court monitoring, substance use testing and counseling while participating in the program.
“This program is intense and will be hard work, but these participants will have a full team behind them,” Mills-Pyles said.
The program in the Sixth Judicial Circuit is a cooperative effort of the court, Child Protective Services, substance use disorder treatment providers, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) and others. 
Musician and comedian Cledus T. Judd, who is in recovery for substance use disorder, attended the opening ceremony at the Cabell County Courthouse in Huntington. While Judd did not attend a specialized treatment court, he said he hoped to inspire participants that recovery is possible.
“My love for my child was my recovery,” Judd said. “It’s not a child’s job to save a parent’s life, but it’s a parent’s job to save a child’s life … You can become something, because I did.”
As a result of the foster care crisis, West Virginia’s courts — from circuit courts all the way to the state Supreme Court of Appeals — are inundated by child abuse and cases and appeals. The state’s ongoing shortage of CPS workers has also impacted the court system, causing delays in cases and finding children a permanent home.
The Family Treatment Court often moves the cases along faster, leading to quicker permanency for children in the foster care system. Hammers noted that it was also saving the state money.
According to the state Supreme Court of Appeals, West Virginia has saved $7 million in foster care or kinship subsidy payments through Family Treatment Courts.
The programs have been funded through grant dollars, most commonly from federal grants and McKesson Corporation opioid settlement funds administered by the West Virginia Office of Drug Control Policy. Family Treatment Courts cost around $85,000-$100,000 per year to operate.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Is Idaho about to fall off the fiscal cliff due to irresponsible budgeting?
No. The Gem State’s current budget has a decent ending fund balance, substantial budget reserves on hand, and many important fiscal tools available should the economic outlook for the state and country change.
Unfortunately, there’s a false narrative going around that Gov. Brad Little’s prudent use of budget planning tools means the state is on the wrong path.
Here are the current details for the state’s budget framework:

2026 adopted spending: $5.62 billion 
Ending fund balance: $345 million (6.2%)
Unrestricted general fund reserves: $880 million (14.8%)
Total reserves: $1.307 billion (22.1%)

Due to a softening of the forecasted revenue growth, the Division of Financial Management sent a memo to state agencies on May 29 requesting they identify potential spending “holdbacks.”
From the memo: “Governor Little will prioritize critical investments in essential areas while ensuring a conservative and balanced budget for Idaho . . . We are asking all state agencies to internally prepare 2%, 4%, and 6% budget holdback scenarios to have in place as we continue to watch economic trends at the national level. This exercise not only helps us be prepared for uncertainty but also allows agencies to look internally at priorities and operations and ensure critical operations are prioritized.”
I recently had the opportunity to talk with Idaho’s Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff about the state’s budget outlook. She expressed confidence in the budget balance sheet and told me that the governor’s request for agencies to identify possible spending holdbacks isn’t all related to changing revenue growth projections.
  Division of Financial Managment Administrator Lori Wolff answers questions from reporters at a press conference before the annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
“Sometimes holdbacks are not due to revenue but to reduce future spending pressures,” she said.
Some have interpreted the May memo to claim that lawmakers were irresponsible to prioritize tax relief or invest in the new education choice tax credit (House Bill 93) this year. Instead, it shows the governor is taking advantage of a rational budget management tool to provide options if the economic outlook deteriorates in the future.
Remember, revenues are still growing, and there is a $345 million ending fund balance for fiscal year 2025 and $880 million in unrestricted reserves ($1.3 billion in total reserves).
It is because of the state’s strong fiscal management that Fitch recently reaffirmed its top AAA credit rating for Idaho. Fitch noted: “Fitch believes the state is well positioned to absorb multiple rounds of recent tax cuts and dedicated spending allocations from the general fund, given Idaho’s prudently managed budget with significant one-time spending that rolls off to create fiscal capacity.”
Should the economic outlook deteriorate significantly, however, Gov. Little has the option of using the aforementioned holdbacks, budget reserves, or a combination of the two. Realizing that a 10% reserve is considered healthy, Idaho has significant capacity to draw from its nearly 15% unrestricted savings account (22% in total reserves) if needed, without imperiling its budget stability.
As Administrator Wolff noted in June: “Idaho also has 22% of general fund revenues in rainy day funds, greater than almost every other state. While we continue to watch revenue closely, we feel good about the strength of the state budget and our economy.”
State of Idaho ends 2025 fiscal year with approximately $345M ending balance

A July 11 press release from Gov. Little highlighted this positive economic growth for Idaho: “Withholding collections – reflecting job and wage growth – are up 5.9% over last year. Gross sales tax revenues are up 3.7%, and online sales tax collections are tracking 13.2% above last year. Idaho’s GDP has grown 150% in the last five years. Adjusting for inflation, Idaho’s real GDP is up more than 21% in the past five years alone, demonstrating exponential, resilient growth. In addition, Idaho ranks third in the nation for the largest increase in average weekly wages.”
Just to illustrate how prudent Idaho’s budget balance sheet is, let’s compare it with our neighbors in Washington state. Despite imposing the largest tax increase in state history this year, the Evergreen State has only a fraction of the budget discipline Idaho has demonstrated. For example:

Washington’s ending funding balance is only $33 million (or 0.04%) compared to Idaho’s $345 million (or 6.2%).
Washington’s total budget reserves are only 2.7% compared to Idaho’s 22%.

There is no denying that there are economic headwinds facing state budgets across the country, driven primarily by unpredictable fiscal policy at the federal level. The good news for Idaho is that the state’s balance sheet is sound, with a 6.2% ending fund, more than a billion dollars in total reserves, and state revenues are still projected to grow overall.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Rose is reporting more than $6.1 million in fundraising for Tennessee’s 2026 gubernatorial race, calling it an “unprecedented start” for the campaign, though most comes from a personal loan.
The state’s former commissioner of agriculture announced he raised $1.1 million from hundreds of supporters in all 95 of Tennessee’s counties and made an initial loan of $5 million to his campaign after announcing his candidacy in March.
“To receive this level of support in just a few short months from my fellow Tennesseans is huge for our campaign and my mission to protect our shared values,” Rose said in a release. “This is more than just a fundraising number — it’s a clear signal that voters want to defend this state and our freedoms just as badly as I do.”
The Cookeville resident who owns a family farm in rural Temperance Hall put together most of his wealth through an online information technology company he founded in 2000. He is now owner and president of Boson Software.
Campaign chairman Chris Devaney called the initial fundraising total an “unprecedented start” that puts Rose in a “commanding position.” Rose’s campaign had not filed a report with the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance as of Monday.
While Rose’s campaign touts what it calls the largest first filing in Tennessee gubernatorial history, the 2018 Tennessee Republican gubernatorial primary was expensive as well. 
By the end of the campaign, the five candidates — Gov. Bill Lee, University of Tennessee President Randy Boyd, former U.S. Rep. Diane Black, former House Speaker Beth Harwell and former state Sen. Mae Beavers — had spent almost $50 million. 
In the first two months of his initial campaign, Lee raised $1.4 million and loaned his campaign nearly $1.4 million for a total of $2.8 million. Lee, who is wrapping up his second four-year term, still has outstanding loans of $4.58 million.
Boyd, in the first four months of his campaign, raised $4.4 million, about half of which was a personal donation of $2 million. 
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn is expected to enter the Republican primary in the governor’s race but hasn’t made an announcement.
Memphis City Council member Jerri Green said last week she will run in the Democratic primary for the governor’s seat.

One of the primary drinking water sources for the region, the river has high nitrate levels that have led to water restrictions for some 600,000 customers. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
 The role of agriculture

As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.


Central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels.


Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
 Citizen action

The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walton League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.










I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.


– Northeast Iowa retired science teacher Birgitta Meade


While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
 Small towns struggle

Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

FEMA announced Monday that Carroll, Houston and Wayne counties are now eligible for public assistance funding, which helps reimburse some local government costs for debris removal and repairs to public infrastructure or facilities.
Local governments and some nonprofit organizations affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding in April can now apply for assistance. 
The counties join a cadre of other Tennessee counties approved for public assistance in June, including: Cheatham, Davidson, Decatur, Dyer, Fayette, Gibson, Grundy, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, Henry, Hickman, Lauderdale, Madison, McNairy, Obion, Perry, Stewart and Tipton counties.
Private nonprofit organizations that provide “non-critical services of a governmental nature” — including food kitchens, homeless shelters, museums, libraries, community centers and schools — may also be eligible to apply for low-interest federal disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration.
These loans include business physical disaster loans of up to $2 million to repair or replace buildings, equipment or inventory damaged in the disaster. Economic Injury Disaster Loans can be used for capital needs caused by the disaster, even if the business was not physically damaged.
Businesses and private nonprofits in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties can apply for both types of loans. 
Businesses and nonprofits in adjacent counties — including Cannon, Chester, Crockett, Dekalb, Fayette, Gibson, Hardin, Haywood, Hickman, Houston, Humphreys, Lake, Lauderdale, Madison, Robertson, Rutherford, Smith, Stewart, Sumner, Trousdale, Weakley and Williamson — can apply only for Economic Injury Disaster Loans, according to the SBA.
Homeowners and renters may also be eligible to apply for loans of up to $100,000 to replace or repair vehicles, clothing, furniture, cars and appliances. Homeowners can apply for loans of up to $500,000 to replace or repair their primary residence, according to the SBA.
The deadline for homeowners and renters in Cheatham, Davidson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties to apply for FEMA assistance is Aug. 19.
Individual assistance dispersals reach $3M and counting
President Donald Trump’s administration also approved individual assistance for people affected by the storms in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties.
Eligible applicants can receive individual grants for temporary housing and home repairs, support services, and low-cost loans for uninsured losses (FEMA doesn’t cover losses already covered by insurance). 
FEMA has approved 438 applications for individual assistance totaling $3.4 million as of July 14. That includes roughly $1.8 million in housing assistance and about $1.6 million in other assistance, according to FEMA’s website.
FEMA recommends affected individuals file a claim with their insurance company immediately, before applying for FEMA aid.
Affected individuals can apply for individual assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov, through FEMA’s mobile app or by calling 800-621-3362. Help with applications is also available at Disaster Recovery Centers set up in each eligible county. Centers offer assistance information from FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration. All centers are closed on July 4. Hours for each center as well as additional resources can be found at fema.gov/disaster/4878.

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

(Photo: Getty Images)As a former Metro Nashville Public School teacher, I know firsthand what it is like when children do not get enough time to play.
I still remember my days as a middle school teacher, watching students’ attention spans (and attitudes) deteriorate after hours of sitting in class. The attitudes and attention spans would drastically improve after they came back in from playing. It seemed like a reset button had been pressed. 
That’s why Tennessee’s new bipartisan recess law, which requires 40 minutes of daily unstructured play for K-5 students, is such a victory for our children.
This unstructured time, which the law prioritizes to be taken outside, will truly be beneficial to our Tennessee students. This is a change from the current law, which states that elementary schools must have 130 minutes of recess a week. After revising the original bill from 60 minutes a day to 40 minutes a day, the law was approved by every legislator except one. 
As someone who studies the cognitive development of young children, I am extremely happy about this bill. The benefits range far beyond just offering more time for students to run around; it will also give them the time they need to develop self-regulation, a crucial life skill that will pay dividends far beyond elementary school.
Self-regulation is the ability to manage one’s thoughts, feelings, and actions. It’s what helps a child stick with a tough math problem instead of giving up. It’s what allows them to calm down when a friend hurts their feelings.
Research shows that children with strong self-regulation skills do better academically and have better mental health. While children begin developing this skill prior to kindergarten, the elementary school years are crucial. In fact, a child’s self-regulation in elementary school has been linked to reduced unemployment, mental health concerns, and criminal behavior 30 years later. 
This brings me back to the playground, the kingdom of movement and play. On any given day, it’s where you will see self-regulation in action. When playing freeze tag, a child must stop and no longer run until they are unfrozen. That ability to freeze and follow the rules teaches them impulse control. When playing four-square with others, they learn cooperation and conflict resolution. Self-regulation in children shows up as not having a tantrum after being eliminated and cheering on their friends from the sidelines instead. This shift is connected directly to play and is why recess is such an important component of early childhood education. 
Tennessee’s extended recess is thanks to dedicated parents in Clarksville who first pushed their local school district to expand recess and then decided to head to the state to make a change to benefit all students. 
As parents, they saw firsthand the need for play in their children. They formed the “Say YES to RECESS Tennessee” group to help advocate for more recess across the state. With the passage of the bill, they are already hearing some struggles with schools that have to make changes to a packed daily schedule. Rachel Bush, with the group, says, “We’re not talking about cutting math and reading in half, but really just looking at shaving a little bit here and there to increase recess to then help every other subject in the classroom.”
The group succeeded where teachers have struggled since No Child Left Behind — the law intended to improve education, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds — slashed recess time in 2002. For two decades, we’ve prioritized test scores over play, and our children have paid the price. 
Teachers are speaking out on the behavioral issues that are happening in schools across the country. Many of these issues stem from poor self-regulation — kids who never learned to manage their impulses through play. There’s a chance that this recess bill could shift the state’s focus back to teaching the whole child. As children play more this upcoming school year, I hope legislators are looking for more ways to include play within the school day.
How can parents and community members continue to support extended recess and integration of play-based learning? Contact your school board members to ask for more play in school. Support teachers who incorporate play into lessons. And most importantly, celebrate when your child comes home tired and happy from a full day of learning and playing. It’s good for their health — and yours.

The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
 Musk says America Party will focus on a select few U.S. Senate, House seats

Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

 Unite America executive director: Open primaries could improve political representation in elections

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
North Carolina US Sen. Thom Tillis announces retirement after drawing Trump wrath

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.

At one point, one of the volunteer guides caught an interesting looking individual in his net and held it aloft for the crowd of 30 or so firefly hikers to see. They peppered him with questions. 
One asked why the firefly was blinking so furiously. 
“Desperation,” the guide said. 
This firefly was quickly released to rejoin the dazzling light show among the trees, but over the last few years there’s been increasing concern about a decline in the iconic insect that is a staple of summers in Kentucky and beyond. 
Recent viral social media posts claiming that current generations might be the last to see fireflies have stirred nostalgia and, in some commenters, their own resigned desperation. 
Is it really too late to save the firefly? 
Those who research and follow the populations in Kentucky say no. Still, evidence of a decline is there, and rarer firefly species are especially at risk. 
‘How many species do you want to lose?’
Information on the severity of the overall decline is hard to come by, and experts say that’s due to a lack of data. Data on the rarest strains of the about 2,400 firefly species in the world is even more elusive. 
Darin McNeil, an assistant professor of wildlife ecology and management at the University of Kentucky, participated in a study released last year that endeavored to draw conclusions based on the limited anecdotal data that is available. 
The study found a number of threats could be linked to shrinking firefly numbers, including impervious ground cover like sidewalks, roads and buildings. 
But McNeil said the larger than expected impact of weather and climate on the populations of fireflies in any given location was of particular interest. 
“We have to generalize a bit here because we don’t have data on individual species of fireflies,” McNeil said. “So fireflies in the eastern United States as a broad group, seem to really like cool, moist places.” 
If an area sees changes in overall weather patterns, it could see a decrease or increase in common fireflies depending on the temperature and moisture, McNeil said. 
But not all firefly species might be able to move and adapt.

While it doesn’t seem that most common firefly species are in danger of completely disappearing anytime soon, there are a number of more rare species that are at risk. They’re species that the general public might not ever notice being gone, and it’s likely there wouldn’t be a significant ecological impact in losing them, McNeil said. 
“But the thing is, how many species do you want to lose?” McNeil said. “And at a certain point you’re going to start losing so many species that the ecosystem will eventually collapse.” 
The disappearance of one rare firefly species could be an indicator of conditions that could lead to other species going extinct. 
“So I would argue that while, yeah, probably the ecosystem can function without the blue ghost firefly, it serves as a canary in the coal mine for broader ecological issues,” McNeil said.
The blue ghost firefly, a rare species known to be primarily in Southern Appalachia, was spotted at the recent Firefly Friday event at Bernheim. Behind the scenes, researchers at the privately owned forest are taking a closer look at the peculiar insect. 
The blue ghost
The fireflies most Kentuckians are likely familiar with are known for their rapidly blinking yellow-tone glow. 
The blue ghost firefly has a comparatively dim blue glow that is constant for up to 60 seconds at a time. The males also only fly about a foot off the ground.
The females can’t fly at all, which combines with the species’ low numbers to make them especially vulnerable to threats. 
“They’re stuck on the ground, so when companies come through and they clear the land of trees to build apartments or business, you know, offices, whatever that they’re working on, they’re destroying that land and those fireflies are incapable of just moving to a new patch of forest because they can’t move that quickly,” said Kathleen Kerr, a volunteer naturalist at Bernheim who helped lead the recent hike. 
At least 15 species of firefly are known to be in Kentucky, and 13 of those can be found at Bernheim in Bullitt County about 25 miles south of Louisville.

Kelly Vowels, research coordinator for Bernheim Forest and Arboretum, is heading up a collaboration between Bernheim and a lab at the University of Georgia. Two grad students there are looking into two groups of fireflies — one being the rare blue ghost.
The aim of the research is to use genetics to determine the relationship between blue ghost fireflies across their range in the southeastern United States.
A deeper understanding of the species will help with conservation efforts, Vowels said. 
Bernheim’s Firefly Friday events hope to bring some of that deeper understanding to the general public. 
“When you see something in person and you learn to love it and care about it, you’ll take care of it and protect it in the future,” said Lynette Cox, director of marketing and communications at Bernheim. 
‘Feels like magic’
Bernheim’s firefly hikes take place on Friday nights during the best season to see fireflies – late spring into early summer.
“One of the most important things about these events is that it allows people to engage in what feels like magic,” said Jonathan Shirley, one of Bernheim’s volunteer naturalists. “These fireflies, they tie so deeply to our childhood for most of us.”
The fireflies combined with the song of the whippoorwill and the dark skies free of artificial light allow people to “experience something that you might not have access to anymore at your home,” Shirley said. 
Shirley and the other volunteers enthusiastically led the recent group, the last of the season, lit only occasionally by the less-intrusive glow of red lanterns. The hikers included a wide range of ages, including one child who on multiple occasions exclaimed how cute the fireflies were. 
Whitney Nowicke of Louisville surprised her mom with a trip to Bernheim for a firefly hike. She’d seen the social media posts online claiming that fireflies will disappear. 
“While I think there is some truth to that, I think how everything is online, it’s overly sensationalized to make people be like, ‘oh my god, that’s so sad,’” Nowicke said. “And then, you know, when they’re sitting around having a conversation at a bar or whatever, it’s just a talking point for them, but then they don’t really do anything about it.”
Nowicke said programs like the hike at Bernheim showed that there’s still work that can be done to save fireflies. 
Citizen science and backyard conservation 
At the end of the hike, the volunteers gathered the group on a bridge. In the red lantern light, they spoke over the calls of numerous frogs to tell the group about ways they can help preserve fireflies and other species in their own backyards. 
To simplify, Shirley said they could do the most for native species by doing less. Less manicuring of lawns, less nighttime illumination.

In a separate interview, McNeil said that people can also help with the lack of data that has made tracking firefly populations so difficult. The study he participated in at UK relied entirely on data from a project called Firefly Watch, which gathered information through citizen science.
The Firefly Watch project has since changed hands from Mass Audubon to the Xerces Society, but people can still contribute by providing data. 
“You can sign up tonight and submit data from your backyard, or mom’s house or some park up the street, wherever you want, even downtown, and upload data on how many fireflies you’re seeing and some characteristics of that site at the time you’re visiting,” McNeil said. “Even if you see zero, that’s very valuable data.”
McNeil said it’s also a great way to get kids involved and thinking about science. 
Raking leaf litter to the side of your yard instead of getting rid of it is another way to help fireflies, McNeil said. 
Before fireflies become the flying light-bringers we’re familiar with, they spend up to two or three years in a state that looks quite different. And while they’re in that larval state, they need cover like leaf litter to survive. 
‘Tiny little Bengal tigers’
Fireflies have a long lifespan compared to a lot of insects, and only a few weeks of that lifespan are spent flying around and searching for a mate.
After hatching, the firefly will spend up to a few years as a wingless larva that McNeil compared to an “armored grub.” 
And that armored grub is a tiny vicious predator that uses its ability to inject its digestive enzymes to eat things much bigger than itself, including snails and slugs.

“They’re tiny little Bengal tigers,” McNeil said. 
While vicious, fireflies are most vulnerable in that larval state.
So, in instances of singular extreme weather events — like drought, heat waves or flooding — or an overall climate shift or habitat disruption, any change in the number of fireflies we see lighting the night sky might be delayed by a year or two, McNeil said. 
While not as obvious as they are once they start flying, the firefly larvae can still be spotted by observers. McNeil recommends going to a dark park or natural area around April with no flashlight or light source. Once your eyes adjust to the darkness, you can often see the constant glow of the tiny larvae on the ground.
“These animals, they have the ability to glow that is ingrained in every fiber of their being,” McNeil said. 
For now, information on the populations of fireflies remains sparse. Efforts to track them are made more difficult by the fickle nature of the insect, Vowels said. 
“Some nights, they’re all out, and other nights you might miss them, and sometimes they’re early and sometimes they’re late,” Vowels said. “So they’re extremely difficult.”
Still, the efforts will continue. 
“I think now, more than ever, is the time to begin monitoring fireflies so that if there are declines, they’re noticed,” McNeil said.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Texas recently approved $50 million for trials of ibogaine's effectiveness  as a treatment for opioid use disorder. (Getty Images)Kentucky shot itself in the foot by passing up a chance to pioneer a promising opioid treatment — an opportunity that Texas recently seized.
But it’s not too late for the General Assembly to make Kentucky part of an effort to study and legalize ibogaine.
Here is the context: In the late 1990s, Kentucky became ground zero in an emerging opioid epidemic initially fueled by prescription drug fraud and doctor/pharmacy shopping, with much of it paid for by government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare as well as private insurance. 
As an early response in 1999, Kentucky created KASPER, a monitoring system designed to track controlled-substance prescriptions. KASPER is used by both health care providers and as an investigative tool for law enforcement to combat the fraud which had crept into the prescribing of pain-killing medications.
Even with this useful tool, opioid consumption swelled, particularly preying on poorer counties and populations, as well as veterans returning from the new combat zones. Eastern and Southeastern Kentucky were particularly overwhelmed. 
New research and treatment options emerged, including medication-assisted treatments such as Suboxone, and began to be widely used. Drug rehabilitation facilities seemed to be everywhere, advertised on every type of media. 
But nothing seemed to be having an effect, and the epidemic continues to this day. The consequences have been disastrous for Kentucky — from overcrowded prisons and county detention centers to increased unemployment and disability rolls to the serious toll on the state budget and economy.
In a positive turn, state attorneys general banded together to file lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies like Purdue Pharma and chain stores with pharmacies like Kroger. This began under then Attorney General Jack Coleman with major settlements under his successors Attorneys General Andy Beshear, Daniel Cameron and Russell Coleman. 
Woodford County partnered with other Kentucky municipalities to join the wave of litigation. This soon led to hundreds of millions of dollars funneled into state, county and city coffers to be used to fight the epidemic.
The Woodford County Agency for Substance Abuse Policy (ASAP) Opioid Task Force was created to receive and administer the local share of funds by developing local programs.

However, the state’s biggest government player is the Kentucky Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission, created by the legislature in 2021 and tasked with making grants from the state’s portion of the $900 million in settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors, with half of the money going to the state and half going to local governments
The commission has nine voting and two non-voting members, and is housed in the attorney general’s office. 
Cameron was the attorney general who oversaw the first commission and appointed Bryan Hubbard as its executive director. 
Hubbard developed a plan he described as a “moon shot” focused on an emerging treatment protocol using the plant-based hallucinogenic drug ibogaine. 
Ibogaine was successfully being used in two physician-controlled clinics in Mexico and being studied by researchers at Stanford University and top European medical research institutions. 
After months of investigation, consultations with experts as well as meetings with various veteran groups that were focusing on opioid addiction in combat vets, Hubbard met with Cameron and his deputies in the fall of 2021 to present his proposal.
Research and clinical experience demonstrated that administering ibogaine to someone who has addiction eliminates that person’s mental and physical “switch” for the drug and, significantly, eliminates the horrific withdrawal period, which is, more often than not, the formidable barrier to recovery.
Ibogaine alone does not ensure long-term recovery; the person with the addiction still needs the mental health and spiritual support of the recovery process post-withdrawal, but it turns a heretofore rare road to recovery into a wide door of success.
For a state as crippled as Kentucky is by the opioid epidemic, the ibogaine option presented real hope. 
Cameron was persuaded by Hubbard, and $42 million of the initial tranche of opioid settlement funds were dedicated. After months of public hearings across the state, presentations and testimonials from veterans’ groups and science researchers, Hubbard’s proposal was ready to be presented to and approved by the commission. Hubbard, and other supporters expected it to be passed given the makeup of the commission.  
Success would mean funding research, analyzing and working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Congress, partnering with research universities — though the University of Kentucky, via its representative on the commission and lobbying the Beshear administration, fought the initiative — developing trials, and particularly valuable to the state’s treasury, ensuring ownership of patents and other intellectual property. 
After several meetings and scientific presentations, Hubbard gained the support of the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, the preeminent Kentucky health policy foundation, and its then-CEO Ben Chandler, a former state attorney general, who testified and lobbied in support of the ibogaine initiative. (Chandler also is publisher of The Woodford Sun.)
Hubbard spoke to Woodford County’s ASAP opioid commission last year. Nancy Blackford, a board member who lost a son to opioid addiction, told me how impressed she was with Hubbard and the promise ibogaine held.
A sure thing? No. There were legal hurdles yet to overcome given that ibogaine is illegal due to its hallucinogenic properties, as well as posing a serious cardiac clinical side effect that is sometimes seen during its use. 
But Kentucky was with open eyes and an investment of $45 million — a modest amount given the total size of the opioid settlements — ready to step forward.
But that did not happen. Instead, Kentucky shot itself in the foot.
At this point, we don’t yet know all the actors and circumstances that led to the decision, but newly elected Attorney General Coleman fired Hubbard and pulled the plug on the ibogaine program. The proposal was rejected by the commission on Jan. 4, 2024, the first meeting with Coleman as attorney general and his appointee Chris Evans, a former chief operating officer for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, leading the commission. 
In one of his first major decisions as attorney general, Coleman opted for the safe, same ol’, same ol’. 
But the ibogaine initiative did not die. Hubbard created the American Ibogaine Initiative (AII) and partnered with former Texas Gov. and U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.
Perry became so convinced this was a miracle opportunity that he  testified to the Kentucky commission and helped fundraise and support Hubbard’s new endeavor. 
The two appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Jan. 2, 2025, for two hours explaining and discussing the promise of ibogaine as the new frontier for opioid addiction.
In June, the Texas legislature approved $50 million for ibogaine development trials based on the drug’s “extraordinary promise as a breakthrough treatment for substance use disorder, trauma-related conditions, and traumatic brain injury, according to a new release from the Texas legislature. Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bill on June 11. 
Texas will be partnering with two of its major medical schools and research facilities in Austin and Houston on the project.  
Colorado, Ohio, West Virginia and other states are actively seeking to partner with Hubbard and Perry’s AII to develop programs in their states. And U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr. recently announced his agency is ramping up government-run clinical studies of hallucinogenic pharmaceuticals to address opioid addiction and other mental illnesses.
“Ibogaine is the Manhattan Project of our time,” Hubbard said after the Texas law was passed. “We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change the fabric of this country. And mighty Texas, in all its strength and independence, is the first state to stand up and lead a revolution in the treatment of trauma and addiction.” 
Hubbard, who resides in Lexington but was raised in the Central Appalachian region of Virginia, told me a few weeks ago, “What began in Kentucky will return to Kentucky. Not in the timeline or terms we would have wished, but it is my hope and fervent prayer it is coming.” 
According to Hubbard, the legislature could still become part of a coalition of states to accelerate ibogaine’s pharmacological development and ultimate widespread availability by establishing, with an appropriation, drug trial sites in partnership with the drug companies already involved (what Texas is doing). He says Kentucky could still benefit from some intellectual property rights.
Though Hubbard declined to go into details, the cleanest and best path appears to bypass Gov. Beshear and Attorney General Coleman to get the deal done in the legislature during the 2026 session, which is a long one and well suited to this type of issue.
For the rest of us, let’s hope our political leaders don’t shoot the other foot when the ibogaine boat sails back.

Janet Mills unveiled the state's updated climate action plan. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Environmental advocates secured several key victories in Maine’s latest legislative session, including the establishment of a state energy department and a new clean power goal. But some priority climate bills were voted down or left unresolved until next year.
Still, advocates said there are several policies to celebrate. 
At the beginning of the legislative session, a statewide alliance of 39 conservation, climate action, and public health organizations known as the Environmental Priorities Coalition highlighted its nine priority areas with corresponding legislation for this year. 
In a post-session look back, Maine Conservation Voters, which is part of the coalition, and the Maine Labor Climate Council also highlighted other key pieces of legislation related to labor, climate action and a responsible transition to clean energy.
“The last six months of advocating in Augusta were not without some nail-biting moments and disappointments, but the overall results for people and nature were positive and a testament to the hard work of legislative champions, strong coalitions, and the advocacy and activism of Maine people who care deeply about protecting the Maine we all love,” said Nick Janzen, director of policy and partnerships for Maine Conservation Voters.
Here’s a closer look at the wins, losses and what’s yet to be determined.
Environmental wins 
Lawmakers approved LD 1270, which will transition the current Governor’s Energy Office into a cabinet-level Department of Energy Resources. The new department will oversee the planning and coordination of state energy policy, as well as gain the authority to conduct competitive energy procurements. 
“Maine families and businesses deserve access to energy they can count on and afford — and establishing the Maine Department of Energy Resources is an important step toward an energy future that works for Maine people,” said Gov. Janet Mills after signing the bill into law.
The department is expected to formally launch later this year and will be led by a commissioner appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature. 
Mills also signed LD 1868, which enshrined a goal she set in 2023 of 100% clean electricity by 2040 into law. 
“These bills passed at a moment when the federal government is actively undermining entire clean energy industries and putting skilled tradespeople out of work,” said Francis Eanes, executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council. “Together, these ambitious bills put Maine on a pathway to energy independence and affordability, and will create thousands of good-paying Maine jobs.”
President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” signed into law earlier this month phases out clean energy tax credits while making it cheaper to drill and mine for fossil fuels on federal land.  
As the state works toward its clean energy goal, there may also be a new database of clean energy construction projects to identify trends, improve interagency coordination and increase public transparency. Lawmakers passed LD 1850 directing the Governor’s Energy Office to compile such information, but Mills won’t decide on that legislation until January. 
Though opponents saw another bill as an affront to supporters of a 2021 transmission line referendum, some environmental advocates were pleased Mills signed LD 810 into law. They argue it will streamline the approval process for transmission lines that may be necessary for the buildout of clean energy.
Advocates also celebrated passage of LD 1619, which will establish a commission to look into bringing a thermal energy networks program into Maine. Thermal energy networks use shared underground water-filled pipes to more efficiently distribute heating and cooling across buildings or a community.
Priorities voted down 
There were two key climate priorities that lawmakers voted down.
Though it passed in the Senate, LD 1138 didn’t garner enough votes in the House of Representatives. That bill laid out a series of provisions that sought to reduce air pollution from the state’s transportation sector. 
Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Maine, with most of it coming from personal vehicles. 
Lawmakers in the lower chamber also rejected LD 1940, despite support from the Senate. That bill was seen as a way to ease the administrative burden on municipalities in growth management and comprehensive land use planning.
Bills carried over 
Since lawmakers were juggling a difficult budget season, there were a number of climate-related bills that went unfunded and will be carried over to the next session, which starts in January. 
This includes LD 646, which seeks to study the effects of stormwater pollution on waterways in the state. Additionally, there were multiple bills that passed but were ultimately not funded by the budget committee to bolster the Land for Maine’s Future program, which keeps forests, farmlands and working waterfronts open for natural and recreational use. 
Advocates will also have to wait until next session to learn the outcome of LD 1870, which would establish a superfund for large fossil fuel companies to pay for infrastructure repairs, resiliency efforts and other costs in the rural and low-income communities disproportionately affected by flooding and other climate-related disasters. 
Since other states have found themselves in a federal legal battle for passing similar legislation, lawmakers opted for more time to see how those pan out. 
LD 1949, which was a late session bill that seeks to address the “twin challenges” of high energy costs and harmful fossil fuel emissions, was also left undecided. It passed the Senate 22-13, but did not receive a vote on the House floor so it was carried over to next year.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)These are fraught times in the United States. Elected leaders are racing headfirst down some treacherous and uncharted paths, and at such a moment, it’s easy to lose perspective and get carried away with “sky is falling” hyperbole.
And yet, it’s also undeniably true that some of the changes coming to the American social contract as a result of President Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” are the most extreme in U.S. history. The new law will, for instance, slash hundreds of billions of dollars in federal appropriations for Medicaid health insurance and SNAP food assistance.
Nearly 12 million people across the nation and hundreds of thousands in North Carolina are projected to lose their health insurance over the coming years. Meanwhile, as North Carolina’s food banks explained in a recent urgent plea, the SNAP food assistance that will be cut by almost $200 billion over the next decade provides more than two billion meals each year to the 1.2 million North Carolinians classified as “food insecure.”
The proponents of the legislation allege that it will merely root our “waste, fraud and abuse” in these programs, but as even North Carolina’s Republican senior senator, Thom Tillis, has made plain, that’s just not so.
A report from his office estimates North Carolina will lose $32 billion in Medicaid funds over the next decade and the notion that the state’s health care system could somehow absorb such a hit without dramatically reducing coverage and care is beyond absurd. As the senator said prior to voting against the bill, “So what do I tell 663,000 people [people who’ve gained Medicaid coverage in recent years as the result of the bipartisan expansion law passed in 2023] in two years or three years, when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding is not there anymore?”
And so it is that a huge number of people are quite understandably terrified about what the future holds – both for their own personal financial wellbeing and, indeed, for their life expectancy as the new law takes effect.
This fact was powerfully exemplified last week at a press event in Raleigh at which Wake County Democratic state Senator Jay Chaudhuri spoke alongside a pair of local women who explained how their lives have been dramatically transformed for the better by Medicaid.
  Wake County mom Maddie Wertenberg praised Medicaid for changing her family’s life by covering costs associated with her son Oliver’s premature birth. (Photo: Rob Schofield)
Maddie Wertenberg is a Wake County mom who told the story of her son Oliver’s premature birth at which he weighed less than a pound. Wertenberg and her husband had private health insurance when Oliver was born, but even with that, they would still have been left with a crippling and life altering share of the $1.2 million bill his five-month hospital stay ran up.
Fortunately for them, Oliver’s tiny size – she described him as a “nano-preemie” – qualified as a disability for Medicaid purposes and their family’s financial future was rescued as a result. “Medicaid changed my family’s life,” Wertenberg said.
Wertenberg’s gratitude for Medicaid was echoed by a lifetime Raleigh resident named Crystal Upchurch. She explained how she was diagnosed with Lupus in 2009 and how that disease ultimately led to a serious renal condition that requires her to receive regular dialysis treatments — treatments that are, thankfully, covered by Medicaid. As she explained, her ability to continue receiving dialysis treatment is quite literally a life and death matter. “I can’t say it more clearly than this: these cuts could cost me my life,” Upchurch observed.
  Raleigh resident Crystal Upchurch says cuts to Medicaid could cost her her life if they jeopardize her dialysis treatments. (Photo: Rob Schofield)
Similar stories will no doubt abound when it comes to hunger and nutrition. Unless state and local governments somehow find hundreds of billions of dollars to fill the gap caused by the SNAP cuts, food assistance will quickly dry up for millions. This is especially worrisome given the fact that huge numbers of children gain eligibility for free school meals by virtue of their family’s enrollment in SNAP.
Of course, many proponents of Trump’s big bill will tell you they have no intention of cutting off people like Maddie, Crystal and hungry school children. Unfortunately, when experts run the numbers, such arguments are quickly exposed as simply not credible.
Like it or not, the massive Medicaid cuts contained in the legislation will, in fact, make it inevitable that vast numbers of people with stories very similar to Maddie’s and Crystal’s will be sentenced to crippling debt, and/or premature death. After all, that’s what happened in North Carolina during the years GOP lawmakers delayed Medicaid expansion, and the new cuts make a return to those days all but inevitable.
Similarly, the SNAP cuts will cause hundreds of thousands of food insecure people to fall deeper into the abyss of hunger and poverty.
Given this reality, it’s no wonder that so many people already living on the edge are experiencing one of the worst immediate impacts of the mega-bill’s passage: simple terror over what their future holds.
And the utter cruelty involved in intentionally giving rise to such a situation is almost impossible to overstate.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 06:01:30.872981

Dugan was indicted in May by a federal grand jury and has pleaded not guilty to charges that she impeded the arrest by federal agents of an immigrant who was appearing in her court room.  She was arrested by FBI agents in April.
Critics have condemned the arrest as an example of the Trump administration discouraging pushback to mass deportation efforts and a worrying sign for democracy. Federal and state Republicans have supported the arrest of Dugan, saying those who stand in the way of deportations should be arrested and that Dugan should resign or be removed.
The bill, cosponsored by Sen. Cory Tomczyk (R-Mosinee), Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) and Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers), would require that if the state Supreme Court imposes a suspension as proceedings are pending or as a disciplinary sanction due to misconduct, it must be without pay. 
The Wisconsin Supreme Court chose to suspend Dugan in April, saying it was in the public interest to relieve her of her duties for now. Dugan is still being paid her nearly $175,000 annual salary.
The lawmakers noted that Dugan’s trial was postponed from July 21 and may not take place until 2026. They said taxpayers will be paying for “an extended vacation” even as reserve judges have to fill in for her and they argued the bill is needed to stop suspended judges from getting paid in the future.
According to the Wisconsin Judicial Commission, 15 judges have been suspended by the Supreme Court from 1978 to 2024.
“In these rare circumstances, these judges’ actions and alleged misconduct rose to such a level that suspension was warranted,” the lawmakers said in a memo.  “Simply put, Wisconsin taxpayers must be protected from the misconduct and/or commission of a crime by rogue judges.”

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) Public officials are advising locals to avoid the James River in Hopewell and Richmond, after a weekend water treatment plant malfunction released raw sewage into the waterway. They also said the region’s recent heavy rains play a part in pollution in the river but don’t expect long-term effects. 
On Friday night, Hopewell’s water treatment lost power and deposited about a million gallons of raw sewage into the James River. The most affected areas were Gravely Run Creek and sections of the James from the Old City Point Waterfront Park in Hopewell downstream to the Berkley Plantation — areas local and state officials have advised people and pets to steer clear of for the time being. 
“As long as there is no additional discharge, (Virginia Department of Health) expects to lift the advisory on Friday after the river system has time to flush out the sewage through dilution and degradation,” Brookie Crawford, risk communications manager with VDH, said Monday. 
Crawford also recommended that people practice safe food handling if consuming fish they’ve caught and pointed to VDH’s fish consumption advisory dashboard. As of Monday afternoon, there was no fish consumption advisory in place near Hopewell.
A Hopewell communications worker also confirmed that a permanent repair at the plant is expected to be done by the end of the week. 
WTVR first reported that faulty wiring at the water treatment plant had caused a power outage which led to the overflow. Residential sewage and drinking water were not affected, but untreated sewage flowed unabated into the James River during the incident. The plant was fully operational by Saturday, officials said.
The Department of Environmental Quality is investigating the incident. They visited the facility on Saturday and will be working with the plant to find solutions to ensure another leak won’t happen again.
A DEQ spokesperson said the sewage that entered Gravelly Run and the James River would have mixed in the water, making it impossible to clean up. Bacteria will die off over the next several days.
The swim advisory area is not expected to be expanded as the sewage moves downstream; DEQ believes it will be diluted and degraded. Recent heavy rains have led to more turbulent waters, which can also help with the breakdown of the sewage. If the plant remains operational, the swim advisory is anticipated to be lifted on July 18.
There are no long-term effects expected to impact the waterways. However, DEQ and VDH stress that people should not drink any untreated water, should shower after swimming, and should avoid swimming for three days after any significant rain.
Meanwhile, heavy rain poses additional health risks around Richmond since the city uses a combined sewage-overflow system. This means that heavy rains can allow a mix of stormwater runoff and sewage to become present in the river. Richmond has seen heavy rains most nights in recent weeks. 
“Heavy rain picks up anything it comes in contact with, including germs from overflowing sewage, polluted storm water, and runoff from land,” Crawford said. 
If a river or lake has a green film,  a chemical odor, appears cloudier than usual or has multiple dead fish, Crawford said it’s best not to get in. 
State lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully for years to earmark $50 million in the state budget to overhaul the system, though it survived negotiations earlier this year. 
 Region’s previous water woes

Hopewell’s water treatment incident is the latest central Virginia municipal water issue this year. Richmond faced two water boil advisories in January and May as its water treatment plant also faced a power outage, and later, filter clogs.
Richmond issues boil water advisory after storm disrupts water system

Richmond residents were without safe drinking water for nearly a week in early January following a power failure that signaled overdue maintenance repairs for the plant’s infrastructure. Residents in Richmond and Henrico County had to boil their water before consuming it, while those without pressure took advantage of a recent snowfall to melt and boil snow for use. Some residents also sought out natural springs in the area. The state penalized the city for the crisis.
By April, the installation of a new pump led to increased fluoride levels in local drinking water, but officials said it was still safe for consumption. Then in May, clogged filters prompted a water boil advisory for parts of the city and requests for conservation in others. 
In late June, officials from Richmond and Henrico County, which taps into part of Richmond’s water, held a water summit to dissect what went wrong and brainstorm plans for future collaboration on water infrastructure.

(NBC12)Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.	
The National Center for Education Statistics’ data shows that public school enrollment in Virginia decreased 2.9% from fall 2019 to fall 2023.

According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.

A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)The Appalachian region in Ohio and elsewhere is bracing for a big hit as President Donald Trump proposed a 93% cut to funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission.
The proposal is included in a discretionary budget, a year-to-year funding proposal that is different than the mandatory funding included in the recently passed Trump-Republican megabill.
In the discretionary budget, Trump proposed a cut of 93% for the regional commission, from $200 million to $14 million in the 2026 fiscal year, according to the commission.
Local and state officials and organizations from around the region sent a letter to members of Congress asking that the funding the commission has received in the past be maintained.
“The ARC has been instrumental in driving forward (the region’s) potential,” the letter stated. “Reductions to its programs pose a risk to innovative initiatives in workforce development, community revitalization and American-made resilient energy.”

Residents of the Appalachian region spoke out against the funding cuts, saying the commission is part of the momentum that is bringing growth to the region, from skilled trades and leadership development to technical support and grants for local programs.
“The ARC is a critical organization to those of us in Appalachian Ohio,” said Amesville mayor Gary Goosman in a statement. “Funding for infrastructure, broadband and informational services is key to our success.”
According to the commission, a partnership between the ARC and the Ohio Governor’s Office of Appalachia for fiscal year 2024 created $12.5 million in investments for “affordable broadband, clean water and updated wastewater systems, highways and more,” along with $6.8 million in investment toward the Appalachian workforce.
In a report of the most recent data for the region, the commission found positive trends in unemployment rates and labor force participation, but also found that the growth in population in the area is happening at a slower rate than the nation as a whole, and the population is older than the national population, with 1 in 5 Appalachian residents ages 65 or older, according to the report.
The number of Appalachian residents living in poverty or “deep poverty,” according to the commission, stands at more than 14%. The median household income in the region is just under $65,000, which is $14,000 less than the national average.

“The data shows that Appalachian’s rural areas continue to be at increased risk for economic distress compared to its urban areas,” a release on the report stated, adding that those counties fall behind on “educational attainment and household income.”
Ohio’s 32 Appalachian counties wrap from the southwestern edge of the state, all the way around the eastern border, from Clermont County up to Ashtabula County.
Of those, Scioto, Athens, and Noble County are considered by the commission to be economically “distressed,” with 15 other counties considered “at risk,” including Highland, Adams, Pike, Vinton, Jackson, Lawrence, Gallia, Morgan, Monroe, Guernsey, Coshocton, Jefferson, Mahoning, Trumbull, and Ashtabula.
The commission report found that 90% of Appalachian adults between ages 25 and 64 have a high school diploma, but only 28.8% have a bachelor’s degree.
A separate report by the Appalachia Funders Network said the region faces “stark philanthropic inequities” as well, with a lack of nonprofit presence and “chronic underinvestment” in many areas, and 66 counties in Central Appalachia holding less than $1 per person in philanthropic assets, according to the May report.
“The findings make clear that philanthropy must do more to show up equitably in places like Central Appalachia – but it cannot do this work alone,” the report stated. “Public systems and civic infrastructure are critical to sustained, long-term impact.”
Ryan Eller, executive director of the network, said because of generations of “underinvestment and extraction,” the Appalachian Regional Commission is “one of the only consistent partners helping communities rebuild and thrive.”
“The region that helped power this nation’s growth deserves more than to be sidelined,” Eller said in response to the potential cuts. “Maintaining robust support for ARC is not only sound policy – it’s a smart investment in the resilience and prosperity of America’s heartland.”
Congress has a deadline of Sept. 30 to finalize the discretionary funding, and appropriations committees are currently working on the legislation to lay out the funding for 2026.

Here’s a look at some of the legislation that could affect the hospitality landscape in the months to come.
Tightened brewpub regulations
House Bill 242, signed into law Friday by Gov. Kelly Ayotte, tightens how brewpubs are allowed to operate in New Hampshire. Under the law, which is set to take effect at the end of August, brewpubs that want to sell their beer at other restaurants and businesses will be allowed to do so only at one other establishment.
“This is what we call a very inside baseball bill,” said state Rep. John Hunt, sponsor of the bill and chair of the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee.
Hunt said HB 242 was about keeping the brewpub industry small to maintain the status quo in the state’s regulatory framework.
“We have this fantasy that we are a three-tier state,” Hunt, a Rindge Republican, said. “And a three-tier state means that you’re either a beverage manufacturer or you’re a distributor or you’re the retailer.”
Hunt said the bill is about protecting the beer distributors’ “monopoly” on the middle tier of this three-tier system.
“The brew pub is a total, total trashing of the three-tier system,” he said. “Because now you have one location and he is the bottler, he’s the distributor, and he’s the retailer.”
The new law is a follow-up to one Hunt sponsored in 2024 — which limited the amount of beer brewpubs are allowed to sell and allowed the ownership of both a pub and a restaurant at the same time. (It had previously been illegal for the owner of a restaurant to also hold a brewpub liquor license.) He said that legislation, which is now law, was a compromise between the beer distributors and retailers. However, a provision about how many other businesses brewpubs can sell to was cut from the final version. This year’s bill revived and enacted the provision that was removed last year.
Asked why it’s important for the state to protect distributors’ monopoly and the three-tier system, Hunt said: “Frankly, I think the relationship between the distributors and the licensees (retailers) is pretty sacred, and it works well, and there’s no reason to upset them.”
Mike Somers, president and CEO of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, which represents hotels and restaurants in the state, said the industry was unfazed by the restriction.
“You have to understand, in order for one of these brewpubs to make enough beer to self distribute to more than one additional location, they would have to make an enormous amount of beer,” Somers said. “And frankly, most of the folks in the industry that I’ve talked to didn’t really feel that the restriction was much of a restriction, because they could now own multiple brewpubs and restaurants. They could have different brands going in different places. It’s just that each one of them could only just self distribute to one other location, and frankly, most of them didn’t think they could make enough beer to even distribute to another location.”
Social districts
Another new law, House Bill 467, allows cities and towns to create “social districts,” areas in which people are allowed to purchase alcohol at restaurants and bring the drinks outside. It goes into effect in September.
Cities and towns will have to opt into the program in order to create a social district, which they would do by passing an ordinance and submitting a plan to the liquor commission. That plan would include boundaries and time limits, and the new law outlines rules they’d have to follow. Those rules include requiring all alcohol to be in the same kind of container and signage requirements.
Somers said his organization is in support of social districts. Still, he predicts it will be a sort of niche thing.
“I’ll be perfectly honest with you: I really don’t think it’s going to get huge, widespread, year-round or at least season-long adoption,” Somers said. “And the reason I say that is these areas would have to essentially be roped off. They would have to have some sort of police or monitoring at the entrances and exits to these areas. And so I think that with the sheer cost of setting it up and monitoring it on a regular basis, I suspect this is essentially going to become more for large events.”
He pointed to Manchester’s annual “Cruising Down Manchester” antique car show or Concord’s “Market Days” festival as examples.
Alcohol in the restroom
House Bill 81, which goes into effect in August, allows patrons to bring alcoholic beverages into a restroom at a bar or restaurant — an act that is currently forbidden. While the bill had bipartisan support, it became law without Ayotte’s signature. Because she didn’t sign it within five days (excluding Sundays) of it arriving on her desk, it entered law without her signature, per the rules of the New Hampshire Constitution. HB 81 was pitched as an effort to allow patrons to protect themselves from date rape drugs being placed in their drinks while they’re using the restroom.
However, Somers said the industry is concerned about the law.
“We are required to monitor the consumption of our customers to make sure they’re not overserved and those kinds of things,” he said. “And when they go into the bathroom, they are not monitored. And so we don’t know what they’re consuming in there. We don’t know who they’re giving their drink to while they’re in there. So there was a concern for underage consumption, those kinds of things. There was also the concern that, you know, once you bring a drink into the bathroom, what is the bottom of your drink picking up in the bathroom, and then bringing back out into the dining room, from a sanitary standpoint. There are just a lot of unknowns about the various things that could happen.”
He said his organization and its members “certainly appreciate the intent of the bill,” but “think that there is a much smarter way to do this.”
“I’d be shocked if there was a bar in New Hampshire or a restaurant in New Hampshire that wouldn’t basically take somebody’s drink for safe keeping as somebody went to the restroom,” Somers said.
A failed attempt to end New Hampshire’s ban on true bars
One bill that didn’t become law would’ve done away with New Hampshire’s ban on bars that don’t serve food. New Hampshire law has long required bars to serve food as a condition of their liquor license. House Bill 276 sought to create a new liquor license in the state called a “tavern license” that would allow bars to sell hard liquor, beer, and wine without serving food. The proposal was tabled by the state Senate.
Somers said his organization was glad the bill failed because many of those he represents felt it was unfair that they were subject to the requirement for so long and now new entrepreneurs would get a leg up.
“In New Hampshire, we don’t have bars. We have restaurants,” he said. “And those restaurants have to have the ability to cook and produce food. They have to have an ANSUL (fire safety) system, cooking equipment, refrigeration systems, trained staff, food safety, all of that kind of stuff. So you have all of that overhead to get your license currently.”
He said new bars wouldn’t have had those overhead expenses.
“So the concern was that that would then allow those businesses to have a competitive advantage, because they don’t have any of the overhead for the kitchen equipment, staff, product storage, etc. And so therefore they could sell their drinks to a cheaper price, which would siphon off all of the profitable business away from the restaurants.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cocktailbar-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 06:01:30.872981

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
[Editor’s note: North Carolina experienced a decline of 1%. Raleigh’s News & Observer reported on July 9 that this coincides with rise in the number of students attending private schools and home schools and a decline of more than 10% between 2010 and 2024 in the percentage of total students who were enrolled in the state’s 115 school districts.]    
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Courtesy of Matt Cashore for the Kishla Askins campaign)LINCOLN — The Democratic primary for the open U.S. House seat in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District is getting crowded. 
Retired U.S. Navy veteran Kishla Askins, a former deputy assistant secretary of Veterans Affairs under President Joe Biden, is running to be the first Democrat to represent the district in nearly a decade.
“I am the only one ready on day one,” Askins told the Nebraska Examiner. “I am the only one who can walk into Congress and understand how Congress works.” 
For 30 years, Askins said she and her wife have lived where the military told them to live. She grew up in Toledo, Ohio, but her wife, Alison, grew up in Omaha and Lincoln, and now they get to live “back home.” 
They moved to Omaha after Askins’ wife retired from the Marine Corps in the fall.
Askins said she wants to run for the House seat because she wants to serve something greater than herself and fight for people who “deserve strong, steady leadership” and continue her 35 years of service. 
Askins said her focus in Congress would be on improving health care, affordable housing, education and national security. She said people in the 2nd District are concerned about the recent GOP mega bill, the one President Donald Trump called the “big beautiful bill” and its “cuts” to the social safety net. 
She said she would “translate” those concerns to national policy that make access to health care more “fair and equitable.”

In a launch video her campaign shared, Askins said, “Nebraskans are yearning for leaders who can work through our differences, find common ground and wage a selfless fight for a better future.” 
The video highlights her military experiences as she responded to an attack on a U.S. naval destroyer in 2000 and her deployment to Iraq, as well as her service during the nation’s longest war, in Afghanistan. The video also says she helped pass a bill that expanded military mental health care. 
She was appointed to the VA role in 2022. 
Earlier this year, State Sen. John Cavanaugh, the son of a former Democratic congressman from Omaha, formally announced his candidacy. Denise Powell, the co-founder of a political action committee and a business owner, announced her bid in May. Besides the two highest-profile Democratic candidates, Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis have confirmed they are running. And Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades is considering a bid.
Askins says she “loves” that it will be a large primary, because it gives Democratic voters in the district a lot of options and a chance to pick the best qualified candidate who can also win the general election.
The district, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and a slice of western Sarpy County, is typically a target of both national parties, as one of the rare remaining districts that is politically split. It retains a slight GOP lean. 
With five-term U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring, the open-seat race is drawing a politically diverse and competitive field. Observers expect it to prove one of the costlier races in Congress for the 2026 midterms.  
Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha have announced bids to be the Republican nominee. 
Askins took a centrist tone. She said it’s important to approach Congress with the goal of building coalitions, because nothing can get done without building relationships. 
“​​If I’m elected, I will represent all Nebraskans and not just a certain party,” Askins said.

(Photo courtesy of Western Dairyland EOC)A new Trump administration federal rule would bar immigrants without legal status from a range of public programs, canceling a policy that was implemented nearly three decades ago.
The change bars the children of those immigrants from the Head Start child care program. It also closes the door to immigrants lacking legal status for various programs that provide mental health and substance abuse treatment, job training and other assistance.
Head Start, which provides early education and child care for low-income families, has never been required to ascertain the immigration status of its families, said Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.
Families enrolling in the program have to provide a variety of pieces of information to verify they are eligible, Mauer told the Wisconsin Examiner Monday, and the programs are “very compliance oriented” and collect “exactly what they have to collect.”
Mauer said a trusting relationship between Head Start programs and the families they serve is important.
“We’re serving some of the neediest families in our community,” she said. Some have had “challenging relationships” in the past with schools and other government agencies — making nurturing that trust even more critical, she added.
The federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a notice July 10 that declared Head Start and a list of other federally funded programs would now be considered “public benefits” that exclude immigrants without legal status under a law enacted in 1996. The notice revokes a policy enacted in 1998 that had exempted the affected programs from the 1996 law.
The federal announcement said that the policy change was instituted to “ensure that taxpayer-funded program benefits intended for the American people are not diverted to subsidize illegal aliens.”
Mauer said there has been no implementation guidance from HHS since the notice.
The Wisconsin Head Start Association is among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in April by the American Civil Liberties Union opposing Trump administration actions against Head Start. The other plaintiffs include parent groups in Oregon and in Oakland, California, along with state Head Start associations in Washington, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
In a statement Friday the plaintiffs said they will amend the lawsuit if the administration follows through with the limits in the July 10 announcement.
Mauer said that the Wisconsin association is advising Head Start providers to “refrain from making any immediate changes to enrollment policy until they have an opportunity to fully evaluate their legal obligations.”
She said the notice has heightened concern about the safety of children whose families might be targeted by the new federal stance. But it will affect the entire program, she said.
Mauer said a second concern is that the policy could lead some families to take their children out of the program despite their need for it. If enrollment falls below the federally prescribed level of 97% of capacity, she’s concerned that the federal government might then take back grant money — creating “a negative feedback loop,” she said.  
“I am so afraid for our families,” Mauer said. “This is fracturing the safety of all of our children. This will hurt all of the children in Head Start.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has joined a growing chorus of voices calling for the return of political contributions from the now-defunct First Liberty Building and Loan, a Newnan-based lending firm with longstanding ties to the Republican Party.
The company has come under fire after federal officials filed a lawsuit accusing First Liberty’s founder, Brant Frost IV, of running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors out of at least $140 million. According to the complaint, Frost misled investors about the nature of his business while funneling over $5 million to himself and his family members. He also improperly used investor funds to make more than $570,000 in political contributions, the complaint alleged, all of which went to Republican candidates and committees.
“I take full responsibility for my actions and am resolved to spend the rest of my life trying to repay as much as I can to the many people I misled and let down,” Frost said in a statement issued through his lawyer. “I will be cooperating with the receiver and federal authorities and ask that everyone allow the receiver time to sort things out and do his best to repair the damage I created.” 
The allegations have shocked Georgia’s Republican political network, of which the Frost family has long been a part. In 1988, Frost served as Georgia state director for Pat Robertson, a conservative televangelist-turned-Republican presidential candidate. His son, Brant Frost V, worked as a principal at First Liberty and also served as a former vice-chair of the Georgia GOP. His daughter, Katie Frost, chairs a regional committee for the state party. Until last month, both siblings held leadership roles in the Georgia Republican Assembly, a far-right wing of the Georgia Republican Party.
Past recipients of Frost’s political contributions include Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp — who last received a donation from Frost in 2019 — as well as state Sen. Colton Moore and state Rep. Charlice Byrd, according to data from the Georgia State Ethics Commission. Other out-of-state candidates who have received major contributions from Frost include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado.
  Brad Raffensperger. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Raffensperger, whose office is investigating First Liberty alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission, urged recipients to return political contributions they have received from the company or from the Frost family.
“Now is the time for every elected official, candidate, or political action committee who received financial support from this entity currently under investigation to stand up and help the victims,” Raffensperger said. “Ill-gotten gains do not belong in the State Capitol.”
The Democratic Party of Georgia has also urged Republican officials to return the funds.
“We have just learned that numerous Republican elected representatives are funded by money defrauded from unsuspecting Georgians,” said DPG Chair Charlie Bailey. “Now the question is whether Brian Kemp, the Georgia Republican Party, and all the electeds who received this money will do the right thing and return it to the hardworking Georgians from whom it was stolen.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday it has approved its fourth naturally derived color ingredient in the past two months.
The latest color is gardenia blue, or genipin, which comes from the fruit of gardenia flowers. The announcement was billed as another step in the Make America Healthy Again initiative headed by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“Every day, children are exposed to synthetic chemicals in food that serve no purpose and threaten their health,” Kennedy said in a statement. “The FDA’s approval of gardenia blue shows we’re finally putting kids first.”
Per the announcement, the gardenia dye can be used in sports drinks, flavored or enhanced noncarbonated water, fruit drinks, ready-to-drink teas, hard candy, and soft candy.
FDA previously approved two naturally derived blue dyes, galdieria extract and butterfly pea flower extract, which can also make green and purple hues. It also approved calcium phosphate as a naturally derived white dye to be used in ready-to-eat chicken, candy melts and sugars.
HHS and FDA announced plans in April to “phase out all petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation’s food supply,” and to fast track the four natural color additives that are now approved, along with other natural dyes.


SC legislation
Legislation introduced in the House and Senate this spring would ban dyes from meals served at South Carolina’s public schools.
Neither got a hearing before the 2025 session ended. But they could be taken up next year.


The announcement set a goal for the industry to “eliminate” food, drug and cosmetic synthetic dyes, including Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, and Blue No. 2 by the end of next year.
FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, said in the announcement about gardenia approval that the “expedited timeline” the administration has taken shows its “serious intent” to move away from petroleum-derived dyes.
“Now, by expanding the palette of available colors derived from natural sources, food manufacturers have a variety of options available that will make it easier to end their use of petroleum-based dyes,” Makary said in the release.
The administration also urged manufacturers to expedite their phaseout of Red No. 3 dye. FDA revoked authorization of it in January and called for a phaseout by January 2027.
According to the release, about 40% of the food industry has committed to a voluntary phaseout by 2027 of the petroleum-based food dyes.
The industry group Consumer Brands Association announced Friday its plans to voluntarily phase out synthetically derived dyes from products served at schools by the start of the 2026-2027 school year.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
The feds pull back
Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
Disaster declarations
In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

 
There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-15 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawmakers carve a new path around CT budget cap,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/15/ct-budget-cap-underfunding/,Conservatives say the move is a push toward irresponsible spending. But progressives counter it’s the only way to protect core services.,"State officials have underfunded key contractual obligations in Connecticut’s budget by hundreds of millions of dollars for the second consecutive year, knowing the rest of the plan will generate more than enough surplus to cover the problem.
This underfunding allows legislators to assign more dollars to education, municipal aid and other core programs without violating budget caps.
And then, once the budget is in force — and those seemingly intentional shortfalls have been certified officially — legislators have the emergency authority to order extra spending and meet all legal obligations, also without violating the caps.
Conservatives say the latest underfunding problem, identified two weeks into the new fiscal year, represents a push toward deceptive, irresponsible spending. But progressives counter it’s the only way to protect core services from hyper-aggressive budget caps that mandate excessive savings.
“The least we could do is provide the taxpayers with an honest budget, and we haven’t even done that,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “It’s eventually going to lead us to a [problem] when we’re not going to be able to solve it.”
Officials learned this week that projected health benefit costs for state employees and retirees will exceed budgeted levels by $66 million. The gap grows to $144 million in 2026-27.
Though relatively small given the overall budget’s $27.2 billion bottom line, the problem isn’t insignificant, given that the fiscal year is barely underway.
“It’s certainly something that we’re going to have to figure out,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Monday, adding that it could be addressed this fall when legislators meet in special session to review the impact of federal budget cuts on state revenues.
The health care shortfall confirmed by Comptroller Sean Scanlon would be larger had he not negotiated savings worth almost $77 million across two years with insurance carriers earlier this summer.
The comptroller added that “we are very conservative with our estimates” and that his office would continue to search for efficiencies. “We try to get the best cost that we can.”
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that the administration “continuously monitors spending and revenue on a monthly basis and advises the governor and legislature on potential actions that may be necessary in response.”
But a solution won’t be that hard to find.
This fiscal year, the first of the new biennial budget, has a built-in operating surplus of $309 million, and the cushion grows to $557 million next year. 
And a second savings program, which bars legislators from spending a portion of income and business tax receipts, will capture more than $1.3 billion in the first year of the biennium and $1.25 billion in the second, according to state analysts.
The combined budgetary safety net is 24 times the size of this year’s projected health care cost overrun, and 12 1/2 times larger than the second year’s estimated problem.
In other words, state government has more than enough money to adequately fund employee and retiree health care.
Adding to the confusion, Scanlon warned Lamont and the General Assembly about these health care cost challenges months before the new budget was adopted.
Connecticut faced a similar situation one year ago.
Despite early warnings from Lamont, legislators opted not to adjust a preliminary budget to avert likely shortfalls tied to Medicaid and retirement benefits.
But within a few weeks after that fiscal year had begun, about $170 million in projected cost overruns were reported in these areas. Officials brushed them off, as overall state finances were on pace for yet another massive surplus. 
Final numbers from the just-completed fiscal year won’t be reported until September, but Lamont’s budget office pegs that windfall at almost $2.2 billion. That’s about 10% of last year’s General Fund and the second-largest surplus in Connecticut history.
COVID grants had offered a path around spending cap
So why didn’t legislators and Lamont budget more for problem areas over the past two years?
The answer lies chiefly within budget controls and particularly within a spending cap that tries to keep program growth in line with household income and inflation.
Critics have argued for years that the spending cap, which dates to 1991, is flawed, particularly because it doesn’t recognize that certain large budget accounts, such as Medicaid, often grow faster than do household income or inflation. The same was true in the 2000s and much of the 2010s for contractually mandated contributions to pensions for state employees and municipal teachers.
Other budget caps, including the program that captures a portion of income and business taxes, have cooperated with the spending cap to force overall surpluses averaging more than $1.8 million, or roughly 8% of the General Fund, since 2017.
That’s a huge number, given that about three-quarters of the entire state budget largely is fixed by contract or other legal obligations.
State officials were able to craft budgets, despite those savings rules, between 2020 and 2024 largely because Connecticut had received billions of dollars in emergency federal COVID grants. That assistance could be spent outside of normal fiscal cap rules on nearly all programs. So if the spending cap blocked more funding, for example, for social services, federal grants picked up the slack.
But those funds largely had been exhausted by the close of last fiscal year on June 30.
So the conscious underfunding of certain accounts becomes another method to work around the spending cap. By paying less into worker health care or Medicaid accounts, legislators can dedicate more money for education, municipal aid or other core services without, officially, exceeding the spending cap.
And because those worker health care and Medicaid expenses ultimately must be covered because of contracts or other legal agreements, the legislature then has emergency authority to appropriate extra funds. This usually is done many months later, long after the shortfall has officially been reported.
“This is federal government-style budgeting,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. “Sadly, the Connecticut residents are the ones that are going to pay for it.”
Candelora noted his caucus fully funded worker health care benefits in a biennial plan it offered back in early May. 
But all officials — not just progressive Democratic legislators — have found it hard to live within these budget caps as federal COVID grants have been exhausted.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, underfunded contractually mandated health care benefits for state workers and retirees by almost $230 million in the biennial budget proposal he submitted to lawmakers last February, despite warnings from Scanlon.
The governor also convinced legislators to use an accounting gimmick to shift hundreds of millions of dollars outside of the traditional state budget to launch his new initiative to dramatically expand affordable child care program slots by the early 2030s.
House Republicans also used an off-budget account to support a similar child care program expansion effort in a biennial plan they pitched in early May.
And while Senate Republicans called many of these initiatives “gimmicks,” their caucus didn’t even propose a new two-year budget.
CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations, has joined other progressive organizations in calling for these savings rules to be eased and for greater investments in core services.
“We cannot continue to excuse the sufferings of our communities in order to irresponsibly manage our long-term liabilities,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0602_SR_Session_039-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 06:01:30.872981

At a time in which our nation continues to experience the regular horror of school shootings, it’s understandable that everyone grasps for ideas – anything – that seems like it might prevent or reduce the terrifying carnage.
The gruesome notion of a disturbed killer gunning down innocent children is enough to make anyone wish that they could be present with a weapon of their own to stop them.
Unfortunately, as understandable as that instinct is, it simply can’t be the basis of public policy. That should be based on a dispassionate assessment of the facts and data, and it’s for that reason that Gov. Josh Stein did the right thing last week by vetoing a bill that would allow private school personnel and volunteers to carry loaded firearms on campus while children are present.
The bottom line: As the Governor rightfully noted, it’s one thing to have armed law enforcement officers with hundreds of hours of training on campus. Turning security over to volunteers with just a few hours as the bill permits would be much more likely to compromise school safety than enhance it.

Jon Husted. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The office of Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted has deleted a social media post after being asked about the message it sent. The post on X claimed that President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a “pro-family” bill” for “working class families.” 
The law will take health insurance and food support away from thousands of low-income, working Ohioans. The post touting it pictured Husted laughing it up with two men who appear to be prominent special-interest lobbyists.
Husted’s office hasn’t responded to a request for comment.
Gov. Mike DeWine earlier this year appointed Husted — who was then lieutenant governor — to fill the Senate seat vacated by JD Vance when Vance became Trump’s vice president. 
Husted, who will run next year in a special election, has since supported Trump’s appointments and his legislative agenda. 
That includes Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a controversial piece of legislation that squeaked through with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress, and Vance casting a tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate. 
On Thursday in a 9:10 a.m. post on X, Husted lauded the bill and attacked Democrats who opposed it.
“Democrats want this president to fail,” it said. “And, if that means Americans fail, too, Democrats are OK with that. That’s not acceptable. Republicans just led by passing a pro-family, pro-business, pro-growth, pro-America bill for working class families.”
  A screen grab of a post by U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, that his office later deleted.
One of the reasons that the bill is so controversial is that it provides giant tax cuts that will increase deficits by $3.8 trillion, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation reports. 
Husted’s office didn’t respond when asked whether he agreed with that estimate and to explain how ballooning the national debt was pro-business, pro-America, or pro-growth.
Of the tax cuts in the bill, $1 trillion will go to the richest 1% of Americans over the next decade, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
Proposed SNAP changes could swamp Ohio’s overburdened system

Meanwhile, it will cut more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
In sum, the Yale Budget Lab concluded, the bill will give the richest 1% — about 3 million Americans — $30,000 more a year on average. Meanwhile, the poorest 20% — 68 million Americans — will get $700 less, the analysis said. 
The legislation delayed the deepest pain from the cuts until the beginning of 2027 — just after the 2026 midterm elections in which Husted must run.
Ohio food bank officials said that when the food cuts take effect, they’ll be overwhelmed. 
And emergency doctors say the Medicaid cuts will explode wait times and degrade care for all Ohioans. That’s because the cuts threaten to take health coverage away from hundreds of thousands of Ohioans and swamp providers with patients who can’t pay.
Husted’s office also didn’t respond to questions asking how those policies are pro-family or good for the working class. 
And it took down the post on X after being asked by the Capital Journal about the men Husted was pictured with in it. 
They weren’t identified in the post, but one appears to be Tom Balzer, CEO of the Ohio Trucking Association. His web bio boasts “significant legislative wins. Including a 1,400% increase in assets, greater transparency and membership engagement, increased donations to the Political Action Committee and a heightened presence in Ohio politics.”
He’s listed as an agent for the Trucking Association and the Ohio Chapter of International Warehouse and Logistics Association on a database maintained by the Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee.
The other man pictured laughing with Husted appears to be Victor Hipsley of the Governmental Policy Group. He’s registered as lobbying for dozens of special interests, including the Ohio Coal Association, Koch Government Affairs, and Duke Energy Business Services.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Cincinnati-area imam and hospital chaplain Ayman Soliman is currently being held at the Butler County jail. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him at a routine check-in last week.
Soliman fled Egypt in 2014 and was granted asylum status in the U.S. in 2018. Since then, he’s applied for a green card, and worked as a chaplain, including at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.
Soliman has no criminal record in the U.S., but in June, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services revoked Soliman’s asylum status. He’s currently challenging the move in court.
Attorneys for Soliman have also filed a habeas corpus petition to keep Soliman in the Butler County jail. They worry the government might move him a different facility, potentially putting him in a less favorable jurisdiction while cutting him off from legal counsel.
“We have witnessed numerous incidents of detainees being removed under the cover of darkness and hastily shuffled from one location to another without legal contact,” Muslim Legal Fund of American Attorney Kate Brady said. “This filing is an attempt to shield Mr. Soliman from these detrimental tactics, and we urge the Court to fulfill our request.”
Cincinnati’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Greg Landsman said on Facebook he’d gotten commitments that ICE would not move Soliman.
On Monday, District Court Judge Michael Barrett directed parties in the case to figure out timing for an immediate conference, but as of Monday afternoon there’s been no official decision on the habeas petition.
In an email, an ACLU of Ohio spokeswoman said they expect Soliman to have a bond hearing July 23.
In a written statement a Department of Homeland Security spokesman stressed that a pending application or lawful status don’t shield a person from immigration enforcement action.
“USCIS is responsible for administering America’s lawful immigration system, ensuring the integrity of the immigration process, and protecting the interests of the American people by screening and vetting aliens,” the statement continued. “But generally speaking, and as a matter of practice, USCIS does not discuss the details of individual immigration cases and adjudication decisions.”
How we got here
According to Soliman’s habeas petition, federal authorities informed him last December that they would begin the process of revoking his asylum status. On June 3, his asylum status was officially terminated.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to an affidavit, Soliman challenged his revocation and initially got a July 3 court date. The court date got pushed back and ICE asked him to show up for a regular check-in.
Instead, when he showed up July 9, Soliman was met by an ICE and FBI agents who subsequently interrogated him for more than two hours.
They asked about his “views on Egyptian politicians and well known organizations in Egypt and in the surrounding Middle East area,” Soliman’s affidavit described. They also asked about Soliman’s time in the U.S. and his family’s political affiliations.
At the end of the interview, the agents placed Soliman under arrest. His attorney argued Soliman is not a flight risk or a threat to the community, and offered to have him wear an ankle monitor or check in regularly on a phone app. The agents turned her down.
In a press release, Soliman’s attorney Nazly Mamedova argued, “Mr. Soliman overcame hurdles to create a home in the United States, following every rule and process along the way. We remain steadfast in our commitment to securing his safety and release.”
Soliman’s case has prompted pushback from local leaders and state lawmakers who argue federal officials aren’t being transparent.
State Rep. Rachel Baker, D-Cincinnati, called Soliman “a man of peace and empathy — a caregiver, a faith leader, and a bridge-builder in our community.”
“It is deeply disturbing that we are now detaining non-criminal religious leaders who are following the legal process,” she added. “We are calling for answers and accountability following his unexpected detention. The America I believe in prioritizes compassion, common sense, and due process.”
The problems came to light in 2021, when Soliman was offered a job as a chaplain with the Oregon Department of Corrections. Soliman’s job offer was eventually rescinded because he was unable to clear up an FBI flag in his background check.
Looking for answers, Soliman filed record requests with federal agencies and eventually took them to court.
“The Department of Corrections could not fully clear him to begin his position because of an unresolved ‘FBI flag’ on his background check,” his complaint states. “That, combined with the numerous “SSSS” designations on his boarding passes when he travels, give him reason to believe he is included in the Terrorist Screening Database.”
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to the FBI about Soliman’s status.
“The FBI does not confirm or deny an individual’s watchlist status,” a spokesperson wrote back. “The Threat Screening Center (TSC) is dedicated to ensuring watchlisting and screening activities are conducted in a manner consistent with protecting privacy and civil liberties.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Legal battles over President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship continued on July 10, 2025, after a New Hampshire federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction that will, if it’s not reversed, prevent federal officials from enforcing the order nationally.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante, a George W. Bush appointee, asserts that this policy of “highly questionable constitutionality … constitutes irreparable harm.”
In its ruling in late June, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to deny citizenship to infants born to undocumented parents in many parts of the nation where individuals or states had not successfully sued to prevent implementation – including a number of mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southern states.
Trump’s executive order limits U.S. citizenship by birth to those who have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident. It denies citizenship to those born to undocumented people within the U.S. and to the children of those on student, work, tourist and certain other types of visas.
The preliminary injunction is on hold for seven days to allow the Trump administration to appeal.
The June 27 Supreme Court decision on birthright citizenship limited the ability of lower-court judges to issue universal injunctions to block such executive orders nationwide.
Laplante was able to avoid that limit on issuing a nationwide injunction by certifying the case as a class action lawsuit encompassing all children affected by the birthright order, following a pathway suggested by the Supreme Court’s ruling.
Pathways beyond universal injunctions
In its recent birthright citizenship ruling, Trump v. CASA, the Supreme Court noted that plaintiffs could still seek broad relief by filing such class action lawsuits that would join together large groups of individuals facing the same injury from the law they were challenging.
And that’s what happened.
Litigants filed suit in New Hampshire’s district court the same day that the Supreme Court decided CASA. They asked the court to certify a class consisting of infants born on or after Feb. 20, 2025, who would be covered by the order and their parents or prospective parents. The court allowed the suit to proceed as a class action for these infants.
What if this injunction doesn’t stick?

If the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit or the Supreme Court invalidates the New Hampshire court’s newest national injunction and another injunction is not issued in a different venue, the order will then go into effect anywhere it is not currently barred from doing so. Implementation could begin in as many as 28 states where state attorneys general have not challenged the Trump birthright citizenship policy if no other individuals or groups secure relief.
As political science scholars who study race and immigration policy, we believe that, if implemented piecemeal, Trump’s birthright citizenship order would create administrative chaos for states determining the citizenship status of infants born in the United States. And it could lead to the first instances since the 1860s of infants being born in the U.S. being denied citizenship categorically.
States’ role in establishing citizenship
Almost all U.S.-born children are issued birth certificates by the state in which they are born.
The federal government’s standardized form, the U.S. standard certificate of live birth, collects data on parents’ birthplaces and their Social Security numbers, if available, and provides the information states need to issue birth certificates.
But it does not ask questions about their citizenship or immigration status. And no national standard exists for the format for state birth certificates, which traditionally have been the simplest way for people born in the U.S. to establish citizenship.
If Trump’s executive order goes into effect, birth certificates issued by local hospitals would be insufficient evidence of eligibility for federal government documents acknowledging citizenship. The order would require new efforts, including identification of parents’ citizenship status, before authorizing the issuance of any federal document acknowledging citizenship.
Since states control the process of issuing birth certificates, they will respond differently to implementation efforts. Several states filed a lawsuit on Jan. 21 to block the birthright citizenship order. And they will likely pursue an arsenal of strategies to resist, delay and complicate implementation.
While the Supreme Court has not yet confirmed that these states have standing to challenge the order, successful litigation could bar implementation in up to 18 states and the District of Columbia if injunctions are narrowly framed, or nationally if lawyers can persuade judges that disentangling the effects on a state-by-state basis will be too difficult.
Other states will likely collaborate with the administration to deny citizenship to some infants. Some, like Texas, had earlier attempted to make it particularly hard for undocumented parents to obtain birth certificates for their children.
Potential for chaos

If the Supreme Court rejects attempts to block the executive order nationally again, implementation will be complicated.
That’s because it would operate in some places and toward some individuals while being legally blocked in other places and toward others, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in her Trump v. CASA dissent.
Children born to plaintiffs anywhere in the nation who have successfully sued would have access to citizenship, while other children possibly born in the same hospitals – but not among the groups named in the suits – would not.
Babies born in the days before implementation would have substantially different rights than those born the day after. Parents’ ethnicity and countries of origin would likely influence which infants are ultimately granted or denied citizenship.
That’s because some infants and parents would be more likely to generate scrutiny from hospital employees and officials than others, including Hispanics, women giving birth near the border, and women giving birth in states such as Florida where officials are likely to collaborate enthusiastically with enforcement.
The consequences could be profound.
Some infants would become stateless, having no right to citizenship in another nation. Many people born in the U.S. would be denied government benefits, Social Security numbers and the ability to work legally in the U.S.
With the constitutionality of the executive order still unresolved, it’s unclear when, if ever, some infants born in the U.S. will be the first in the modern era to be denied citizenship.

The Central Ohio Poison Center reported 582 marijuana exposures to children under six in 2024 — compared to 79 in 2019 and 11 back in 2015, said Natalie Rine, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center, which covers 64 of Ohio’s 88 counties and receives more than 42,000 poison exposure calls annually.

“There’s been a pretty significant increase in exposures in that age group since legalization,” she said. “It’s odd for us to go a day without having a call about a kid getting into one of these products. … As access to something increases, it’s not surprising that the exposures increase with it.” 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. Ohio medical marijuana sales started in 2019. 
Children
Children who have ingested marijuana tend to be drowsy, sleepy, confused and, in some cases, have trouble breathing, Rine said. It can take hours after a child has consumed marijuana until the symptoms appear. 
“These kids can have seizures sometimes as well,” she said. “… We don’t really have an antidote or anything that we can really reach for. A lot of the care that they’re going to receive when they go to the hospital is going to be direct monitoring.” 
Although it’s not common, there have been times — depending on the amount of  marijuana ingested — where doctors have to put a child on a ventilator for a day or two until the drug gets out of their system, Rine said.
She recommends parents keep their marijuana products out of sight and out of reach in lock boxes. 
“We don’t recommend using them in front of children because children like to mimic what their parents do,” she said. “Don’t store these products where they can be confused with other snacks.”
It’s not just the youngest children who have seen an uptick in marijuana exposures. Children ages 6-12 had 192 marijuana exposures and teenagers 13-19 had 254 in 2024, according to the Central Ohio Poison Center. In 2019, there were 20 exposures to children 6-12 years old and 119 to teenagers 13-19.
 Pets

Marijuana is listed as ninth most common toxin for pets in Ohio, according to Pet Poison Helpline. 
Dr. Edward Cooper, professor of small animal emergency at Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, said he has seen a bit of an increase of pets accidentally ingesting marijuana after recreational sales started last summer, but was expecting more of an uptick. 
“In fairness, part of it may be we’re college campus adjacent, so we’ve always had a, we’ll say, a decent measure of patients presenting with suspected or confirmed THC or marijuana exposure,” he said. 
Sometimes pet owners would be a bit hesitant to admit their pet ingested marijuana before it was legal in Ohio, Cooper said. 
“We’d have to do a little bit of sleuthing … versus people being a little bit more forthcoming,” he said. 
Pets that have ingested marijuana tend to wobble on their feet, stumble when they walk, dribble urine, have smaller than normal pupils, be sleepy and quiet, but tend to overreact when stimulated, Cooper said. 
Pet owners should seek veterinary care if their pet has ingested a significant amount of marijuana or THC products, Cooper said. 
“If smaller dogs get exposed to some of the higher concentration THC containing products then it can be a medical emergency,” he said. “They can progress to loss of consciousness. It can affect their breathing, and that’s something that we definitely would need to intervene on.” 
There are medications that can bind up the THC in their blood, Cooper said. 
He said it’s more of a gray area if the pet has ingested a mild to moderate amount of THC, but “erring on the side of caution (and) seeking some veterinary care … would be a very reasonable thing to do.”

Ohio House Republicans plan to override Gov. Mike DeWine’s vetoes on provisions they say would provide property tax relief but that public school advocates say come at the expense of education.
It is expected to be a tight vote.
Many teachers were relieved when DeWine vetoed several school-related provisions in the state budget, ones that Cleveland Heights School Board Member Dan Heintz said would harm public education.
“It would have been a race to the bottom,” Heintz said. “It would have put school districts around the state in a constant levy cycle.”
DeWine vetoed restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. That provision would have eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions.
For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy, and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
He also removed a provision that would have allowed county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away from passed school levies if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
The governor vetoed another that would have required that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
But the relief that educators felt didn’t last long, as Ohio House Republicans announced their intention to override the governor.
“To make sure that our taxpayers across Ohio see some type of decrease or prevention of the spikes that will happen, we have to override the governor’s veto to essentially be effective for Nov. 1,” state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, said Friday.
Thomas and House GOP leaders have asked lawmakers to come back from their summer recess and override the three school-specific vetoes.
“What I’m hearing constantly from my taxpayers is that they need decreases and they need tax reform now,” Thomas said.
But not every Republican is on board, like former House Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, who said this will hurt schools more than it will help.
“An override — it’s a big deal,” Stephens said. “My concern is if the legislature overrides these particular vetoes, it’s really not going to do that much to lower people’s property taxes.”
Stephens isn’t coming back for the override session. We’ve confirmed that at least three other GOP lawmakers aren’t returning or are voting no.
Several others who had previously told OCJ/WEWS they were no votes could not be reached on Friday.
“The summer is busy,” Stephens said.
To override the governor takes 60 votes. With only 65 Republicans, Thomas can only afford to lose six people.
“I would say that members who are saying they’re not coming back — it’s our job, it’s our duty as elected representatives of the taxpayers of Ohio to make these votes and to do what’s in the best interests of our residents,” Thomas said.
On Thursday, we asked the governor for his thoughts.
“They have every right to come back and make their decision,” DeWine said.
In an attempt to prevent an override, the governor created a new property tax working group to evaluate the best solutions.
“We have to give them some relief, at the same time, we have to balance this so that we continue or able to fund our schools,” DeWine said.
The working group will be run by former Cincinnati Republican lawmaker Bill Seitz and Ohio Business Roundtable CEO Pat Tiberi.
Seitz said that he is helping to point out to lawmakers that the vetoed provisions could be improved by changing their language.
Heintz said he hopes that the lawmakers will listen to the governor, Seitz, and Tiberi.
“We stretch every dollar we have,” Cleveland Heights School Board Member Heintz said. “This can be done without the micromanagement of Mr. Thomas and the Ohio legislature.”
The vote is set to take place on July 21, with the Ohio Senate following that day or later that week.

(Getty Images)During a recent conversation with folks from across Kansas, someone shared a story about a child speaking disrespectfully to a parent in public.
As they told the story, their body language shifted, their tone tightened, and it was clear they were reliving the moment with visible intolerance. The story was presented as evidence of a parent who simply didn’t care about how their child spoke to them. That moment opened a broader discussion on parenting, “out of control” kids, and the belief that today’s parents need to do better.
As a child trauma therapist, I’ve seen those moments play out more times than I can count. As a single mother many years ago, I was that parent. And every time I found myself on the receiving end of glares, unsolicited advice, or outright judgment, I hoped the people watching wouldn’t break their ankles jumping to conclusions. Instead, I prayed they’d walk, carefully, intentionally, down the path of empathy, if only for a few steps.
If they had asked (and most didn’t), they would have learned that I was a single mom working full time, going to school full time, and raising a child with undiagnosed autism. Meltdowns, yelling, boundary-testing — those were daily experiences in our home. Sometimes the goal was just to make it to bedtime without either of us breaking. I didn’t forget how I was raised. I just had to decide which battles were worth fighting.
“Pick your battles” wasn’t a parenting strategy. It was survival. I needed to save my energy for the moments that felt like life or death, not for preserving the comfort of onlookers.
There’s a kind of disconnect I often see, especially from those who’ve never had to live in survival mode, or who didn’t even realize they were in survival mode because someone else was shielding them from it. At some point, that child becomes an adult, and hopefully, they begin asking uncomfortable questions. Why did we only eat rice for dinner every night? Why did we play “indoor camping” with candles and flashlights when it was not storming outside?
Those realizations matter. They are the first cracks in the lens of innocence. And while childhood protection is necessary, it allows our children to hold onto wonder just a little longer. It also can unintentionally create a bubble that limits compassion.
When that bubble stays intact too long, it can create adults who ignore a mother begging for her child to use a locked restroom because she hasn’t bought a drink yet. A child who needs to use the bathroom urgently shouldn’t be up for a policy debate. But when policy is prioritized over people, we become complicit in inflicting pain. The question is: Do we want to be right, or do we want to be human?
Empathy is not about perfection. It is not always convenient. But it is powerful. It pauses judgment. It redirects the impulse to react and replaces it with a willingness to listen. It opens the door for the kind of response that stings the eyes and chokes the throat, not out of guilt, but out of the realization that there’s a world we’ve been blind to.
Nicole Price, my mentor and a leadership strategist with a doctorate in education, recently posted about the shift in the Black vote from Republican to Democratic. There is plenty of debate about what the actual turning point was. But the part we often miss is this: Coretta Scott King was desperate for her husband to be released from jail. She appealed to John F. Kennedy. As a result of his response, her father-in-law, Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., changed the course of an entire voting population with his voice.
Regardless of where you fall on the politics of that moment, the focus here is empathy. Empathy moved her. It moved him. And in that moment, empathy moved a nation.
Empathy is not a weakness or passivity. It is a radical, active force that demands courage, humility, and perspective. It is time for an empathy revolution.
In our families, in our communities, and in our politics, it is not enough to observe, we must choose to understand. The next time you see a human being reaching their limit, pause without mocking or questioning their struggle. Listen to their story, and then act with compassion. Because when we choose empathy, we don’t just change outcomes, we change the world.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Minutes before the surreal show of force by masked, heavily armed federal agents, kids were playing on the soccer field in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, and a children’s summer camp in the historic immigrant neighborhood was having fun.
“Better get used to us now because this is gonna be normal very soon,” said Customs Border Chief Gregory Bovino after ICE agents and military units arrived at the local park carrying rifles and traveling on foot, horseback, and in armored vehicles.
Children and families scattered in terror.
Mission accomplished?
Faceless federal law enforcement moved, unprovoked, on a city park in a major American city in the middle of the day to conduct an apparent immigration sweep with weapons mounted on tanks.
 I cannot get the video out of my head. It should rattle every one of us to our core. Boots on the ground in the land of the free? You okay with that? 
The armed occupation scene in LA that went viral is not a one-off, people. 
Expect the camouflaged army of state police — deployed in full tactical gear to a mostly empty urban park — to greatly expand its militaristic campaign against the racially suspicious in the U.S., citizens or not, following a massive budget infusion from congressional Republicans. 
Unlimited funding has evidently convinced heady enforcers of state-sponsored intimidation and cruelty tactics that they’re untouchable. 
When a rightly livid LA mayor demanded the outrageous ICE assaults on her city stop, the democratically elected leader of over 3,770,000 Angelenos was simply dismissed by the top border official. 
“The federal government doesn’t work for Karen Bass,” huffed Bovino. (So, who does it work for?) 
Moreover, he declared, the veiled federal agents dressed for war weren’t leaving LA until they were good and ready. 
Until their indiscriminate dragnet of people with brown skin met an indefinite quota of no mercy, i.e., prolonged detention without due process and deportation to third countries where the human cargo lacks citizenship, family ties, and protection.

By now you know the vast majority of people being grabbed off the streets, slammed up against walls, ripped from their children, ambushed outside courtrooms, chased down farm fields, and generally terrorized by tough guys who hide behind neck gaiters, are not hardened criminals who threaten anybody. 
They are not even close to being the “worst of the worst” that Trump pledged to deport, according to the government’s own data. 
The besieged populations are the present-day huddled masses whose only crime is working hard and paying taxes in the United States without legal status. 
Some are parents and grandparents with first- and second-generation progeny. 
Many have been on the spectrum of regular ICE check-ins to asylum-seekers and those on the long path to citizenship for years, if not decades. 
They are fixtures in their communities, neighbors, friends. Today they are hunted as prey. Deprived of dignity. Treated as less than human. Wrestled into submission and stuffed into unmarked vehicles bound for unknown destinations. 
Are you ready for armed occupation on steroids in Ohio tearing immigrant communities apart for sadistic spectacle? It is coming. Every single Ohio Republican member of Congress voted for it, while showering billionaires with tax handouts.
With a three-fold increase in its budget, ICE is poised explode its militarized immigration enforcement and detention operation to a level never seen before. Picture thousands of new agents deployed throughout the country. Double the detention centers.
Immigration-related arrests across Ohio have already tripled across the state under Trump. (Imagine it six months from today.) 
A New York Times analysis of the pattern and pace of immigration enforcement from Jan. 20 to June 10 showed raw arrest numbers in Ohio spiked by 209% since Inauguration Day. 
The state’s ICE detention capacity also shot up significantly from two facilities and roughly 120 beds to half a dozen county jails with 1,450 beds.
Ohio’s Geauga County continues its fight to keep ICE contract secret

Housing ICE inmates is a money-maker for counties with struggling budgets and some zealously guard their contractual arrangements with ICE from the public.  
Meanwhile, hundreds of Ohio migrants have been incarcerated, cut off from family and work not for criminal conduct — they pose zero threat according to even ICE metrics — but for navigating a civil immigration system replete with problems. 
Yet for weeks that can stretch into months, prisoners with no criminal histories sit behind bars denied bond and hope. 
Human beings who have been a rich part of the fabric of Ohio, who have filled acute labor shortages in the state and revitalized declining economies are left to rot in cramped cages before, with little notice, they’re shipped back to their origin country or some distant place they’ve never been.
Adding to the depravity that paralyzes Ohio immigrants with fear are Republican state lawmakers pushing several bills through the legislature to enhance the arrest and detention of “any person who is, or is suspected of being unlawfully present in the U.S.”  
They are, in effect, setting the stage for something Ohioans are wholly unprepared to process — the expansive overreach of militarized ICE operations moving, unprovoked, on Ohio cities and towns to seize and disappear even any person suspected of being unlawfully present in the state. 
Get used to a police state and tanks in the road, border chief? Normalize gut-wrenching inhumanity on a mass scale in America?
Never. Never. Never.

Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.

A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

Photos contributed by the candidatesIt’s election day again in Georgia and voters will decide which candidate in the Democratic primary runoff will advance to November’s general election for a chance to win the District 3 seat on the Georgia Public Service Commission.

For more information about the candidates and where they stand on the big issues, read our previous coverage here. 

Keisha Waites, a former Atlanta City Councilwoman and ex-state representative, joins Peter Hubbard, a clean energy advocate, on Tuesday’s ballot. Waites was the frontrunner in the special primary election with a 16,110-vote advantage over Hubbard. Waites was just shy of the 50% vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff. 
Robert Jones and Daniel Blackman were also competitors vying for the District 3 seat last month. Jones received just over 20% of the vote, and Blackman’s votes were not counted after a residency-based disqualification. District 3 includes Clayton, DeKalb and Fulton counties. Commissioners are elected statewide but must live in the district they hope to represent. 
Tuesday’s runoff comes after a week of early voting where polls across the state saw a limited number of Georgians cast their ballots, with less than 33,000 cast ballots last week. 
With only a 0.4% turnout so far, underwhelming voter participation is expected to continue through election day. Critics have warned that low turnout could be costly for several counties across the state. The cost to hold the election could exceed $100 per voter, according to the Associated Press.
The runoff winner will face GOP incumbent Commissioner Fitz Johnson in November’s general election. Johnson was appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021. 
If the election stays on track this year, it will be the first time in years since voters have elected commissioners to the regulatory panel. The commission oversees utilities like Georgia Power and helps decide what Georgians pay for those services. 
A 2020 lawsuit argued that a statewide election for regional districts dilutes the voting strength of Black Georgians, noting that only one Black commissioner has ever been elected under that system. The lawsuit ultimately delayed regularly scheduled PSC elections and is currently pending with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Registered Georgia voters who did not cast Republican ballots in the June 17 primary are eligible to vote Tuesday through 7 p.m. Registration and polling place information can be checked at the Georgia Secretary of State’s My Voter Page.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the Trump administration to make deep cuts to U.S. Department of Education personnel after it lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked the cuts.
The court granted the emergency relief sought by the administration without comment, as is typical in its orders.
But in a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the cuts — firing more than half the department’s staff — amounted to shutting down the agency by crippling its ability to do its job, a step that only Congress can take. She called the majority’s decision to lift the injunction “indefensible.”
“It hands the Executive the power to repeal statutes by firing all those necessary to carry them out,” wrote Sotomayor, who was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. “The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave.”
The Trump administration argued that its plan to slash staffing at the department fell within the president’s authority to streamline operations at executive agencies and eliminating “discretionary functions” that it thought were best left to the states.
Despite what critics claimed, the administration said it its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court that it “has been crystal clear in acknowledging that only Congress can eliminate the Department of Education,” and the planned cuts kept enough staff to “continue fulfilling statutorily mandated functions … [that] in its judgment, are necessary for those tasks.”
Maryland joins 24 states suing White House over refusal to release $6.8 billion in school funds

U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon welcomed the ruling, which she said allows the department to “carry out the reduction in force to promote efficiency and accountability and to ensure resources are directed where they matter most – to students, parents, and teachers.”
But Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Maryland) called the court’s decision “disastrous.”
“It allows mass layoffs of the dedicated civil servants at the Department of Education and puts our children’s future in jeopardy,” Alsobrooks said in a text message. “The investments we make in education now impact the future of our country — we must keep fighting for our children to get the education they deserve.”
President Donald Trump (R) had campaigned on a promise of eliminating the department, and Secretary Linda McMahon called the job cuts the “first step on the road to total shutdown” of the department.
Those cuts, announced on March 11, “eliminated whole offices and teams within the Department” without notice, according to Sotomayor, and the more than 1,378 employees targeted were immediately denied access to their work files, prohibiting any handoff of responsibilities to the remaining workers.
The job cuts were quickly challenged by Democratic attorneys general Maryland and 19 other states —  Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin — as well as the District of Columbia.
A second lawsuit was subsequently filed by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts.
The two lawsuits were combined, and on May 22 U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun of Massachusetts granted a preliminary injunction. Joun agreed with the plaintiffs that the action amounted to dismantling the department without congressional approval, violating the separation of powers.
He ordered the reinstatement of the fired workers and other efforts to return the department “to the status quo prior to January 20, 2025,” the date of Trump’s inauguration. He also prohibited Trump and McMahon from taking any actions to enact a March 20 Trump executive order on “Closing the Department of Education and Returning Authority to the States.”
The government appealed, but the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Joun’s order, saying the government had done little to defend itself. The prompted the emergency request that the Supreme Court granted Monday.

Maryland House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said in a text message Monday evening that the ruling “to allow Trump to continue to gut the Department of Education is truly indefensible.”
“Working families — and particularly our Black and brown students — will suffer the most to benefit those who need it least,” Jones’ text said.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) noted the that majority did not explain its ruling, that he called a “cavalier and callous approach [that] represents a total disregard for our students and the public education system.”
Paul Lemle, president of the Maryland State Education Association, said in an emailed statement students who receive federal support for special education services, are multilingual learners, or come from “backgrounds of poverty” will hurt by the ruling.
“This is a deeply disappointing decision that will cause more chaos and make it harder for educators, parents, and students to get the support that they need and deserve,” his stement said. “This redoubles the importance of doing all we can in Maryland to strengthen and protect our commitment to our students.”
Sotomayor said the majority’s ruling clears the way for the administration to break the law.
“When the Executive publicly announces its intent to break the law, and then executes on that promise, it is the Judiciary’s duty to check that lawlessness, not expedite it,” she wrote. “Rather than maintain the status quo, however, this Court now intervenes, lifting the injunction and permitting the Government to proceed with dismantling the Department. That decision is indefensible.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/educationdepartment2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 01:58:44.741034

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Baltimore’s federal delegation gathered in City Hall Monday to highlight progress on some of the city’s longest-running struggles, such as lowered crime rates, fewer vacant properties and reductions in overdose deaths.
But the successes were overshadowed by recognition that actions from the Trump administration could disrupt future progress in those areas.
“It’s great to be here with the best federal delegation in the country,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott told reporters after a meeting with some of Maryland’s top Democrats. “Especially right now as congressmen across the country are voting to raise costs and strip them of their basic rights and needs, and we are grateful to have this team fighting for us.”
The conversation was part of an annual check-in by members of Congress on how the city is faring and how the federal delegation can help further the city’s goals. Scott was joined by Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, both Democrats, and Reps. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) and Johnny Olszewski (D-2nd).
Scott highlighted continuing declines in the city’s homicides and nonfatal gun injuries in recent years.  Recently, the mayor’s office announced that Baltimore has recorded a 22.7% decrease in homicides and a 19.6% decline in nonfatal shootings since last July.

Other crime statistics have also come down. Compared to last year, auto thefts have dropped 34%, robberies are down 22%, arson is down 10% and carjackings are down 15%, according to recent data from city officials.
“Today is not a cause for celebration – (it is) for recognition of where we are and where we have come and the work that remains for us to go further,” Scott said.
Scott also noted recent progress made on reducing the number of vacant properties throughout the city, noting there are now fewer than “13,000 vacant properties citywide … after two decades of being stuck at around 20,000.”
The members of Congress who joined him each praised Scott for his part in helping to make progress in those areas, but they warned that broad federal cuts and other decisions from the Trump administration pose a threat to those efforts.
“Baltimore is a strong, resilient and caring city,” Olszewski said. “And it is one of the many cities across this country that are deeply under attack by an administration who seems to relish heartless, cruel and often illegal activity in its assault on the people of this country.”
Olszewski referenced the recently approved budget reconciliation legislation that will usher in more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food-assistance programs nationwide over the next 10 years.
Mfume added that those cuts will “affect all of us, but it’s particularly going to affect people here in Baltimore.”
“It’s going to affect children, small children, and pregnant mothers and others who are trying to feed their children — this is where I draw the line with this administration,” Mfume said. “We can’t punish children who are hungry because we don’t like the politics of the city or the people or the parents.”
Scott said that those cuts to Medicaid and other health-based programs could impede intervention efforts to help people struggling with addiction and overdoses, such as in the recent mass overdose event that occurred in Baltimore last week.
He said that investigations on what caused the mass overdose event that led to 27 people needing medical services to recover are still on going.
“All these cuts that are coming to Medicaid, to Medicare, all these things … it’s going to impact every single part of the medical system,” he said, “when you talk about treatment for addiction, behavioral health and substance abuse treatment, specifically.”

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Ben Jealous, the former Maryland gubernatorial candidate turned Sierra Club executive director, is “on leave” from his post at the national environmental advocacy group.
The move comes after significant turmoil during Jealous’ tenure, which began in early 2023.
The Progressive Workers Union, which represents Sierra Club employees, has slammed Jealous for his management of the organization, citing several rounds of layoffs over the past few years, and other labor disputes. They argue he has placed the nonprofit on unsure footing at a time when President Donald Trump’s (R) administration is loosening environmental regulations and targeting clean-energy projects.
Jonathon Berman, a spokesperson for the Sierra Club, confirmed Jealous’s leave but declined to comment further, calling it a “personnel matter.” It remains unclear why Jealous is on leave or for how long he will be absent.
In an email sent to Sierra Club staff Friday, Michael Parrish, the club’s chief operating officer, said that a longtime Sierra Club higher-up, Loren Blackford, would serve as acting executive director in Jealous’ absence.
Erica Dodt, president of the Progressive Workers Union, cited recent layoffs in a news release Monday.
“When facing budget challenges, we have been told and believe that Jealous’ executive team increased its size and salaries all while laying off staff critical to Sierra Club’s success,” Dodt said.

	With Jealous on leave the union looks forward to “working with managers and the Sierra Club Board of Directors to right the ship, and to rebuild trust between the union, non-represented staff, and volunteers,” said Dylan Plummer, unit representative for the Sierra Club Unit of PWU.
The union issued a vote of “no confidence” in Jealous last year, and nonunionized Sierra Club managers and certain chapters took the same step.
Between January 2023 and April 2025, the union estimates that Sierra Club cut 97 staff positions. More recent announcements of upcoming layoffs would bring the total to 140, according to a June news release from the union, which represents 364 Sierra Club staff.
“The Sierra Club must be a strong leader against the Trump administration’s attempts to eliminate bedrock environmental policies and protections,” Plummer said. “It’s incomprehensible that the Sierra Club Board and executive leadership would again discard the very people who stand on the front lines every single day to carry out this work.”
Jealous, 52, was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2018, but lost overwhelmingly to incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan (R), despite running in a blue state. Hogan, who became only the second Republican governor in Maryland to win a second term, won 55.4% of the vote to Jealous’ 43.5% in the general election.
Before his run with the environmental organization, Jealous made a name for himself as a civil rights leader, serving as the youngest-ever president and CEO of the NAACP from 2008 to 2013. After his gubernatorial run, Jealous led the civil rights organization People For the American Way, beginning in 2020.
But the Progressive Workers Union has charged Jealous, the first person of color to lead the Sierra Club, with laying off disproportionate numbers of staffers of color during his tenure. A 2023 layoff was almost half “Black, Indigenous, People of Color,” according to PWU, though BIPOC staff were about 28% of the organization.
The union has also filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, including one arguing that its bargaining team leaders were being targeted for layoffs because of their union activity amid contentious negotiations for a new contract.
“Ben Jealous’s tenure at the Sierra Club has been defined by unprecedented union busting, never-ending layoffs, and the demoralization of staff at the organization,” said CJ Garcia-Linz, a Sierra Club employee and former PWU President, in the June news release.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_3110-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 00:59:05.106347

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Maryland joined 23 other states and the District of Columbia Monday in a lawsuit against the Trump administration, two weeks after the U.S. Department of Education abruptly froze $6.8 billion in funds for summer programs, adult learning and more.
The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the Education Department, the Office of Management and Budget and President Donald Trump. It was sparked by a three-sentence June 30 email to states that said previously approved federal funds, due to be released the next day, were instead being held for review to ensure that they align with “the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”
The attorneys general argue that the funding freeze violates an assortment of federal laws and constitutional principles — both recurring themes in the arguments they made in dozens of similar multistate lawsuits brought to court since Trump took office in January.
They also say it comes at the worst possible time for school systems.
“This reckless funding freeze is directly harming Maryland’s students by taking more than $110 million from Maryland K–12 schools and adult education programs, which has jeopardized teacher training, thrown essential special needs services into chaos, and left families scrambling to find child care before the start of a new school year,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement on the suit.
“Maryland’s students are not pawns in political games over government spending — they need and deserve the educational resources that the Trump administration is threatening to cancel,” Brown said.
A quarter of the grant money typically arrives in state education coffers on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, so local education departments can plan for the year ahead. But the expected payments were paused on June 30, the last day of fiscal 2025.
Federal freeze on funds could cost Maryland schools $125 million this year

The timing leaves state-level education officials in precarious positions as they plan for the year ahead, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said during a virtual news conference Monday with the attorneys general of California, Colorado, and ksuit.
“It is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year … when the president takes the football away from us like Lucy in a Charlie Brown cartoon,” Neronha said.
The funds supported after-school and summertime programming for kids, as well as adult education, and teacher training. It also funded education for English-language learners and subsidized education for children of migrant workers.
Other states on the lawsuit are Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, along with the District of Columbia.
The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A July 9 statement from the Office of Management and Budget  shared with Rhode Island Current noted that the funds were paused after some school districts had allegedly used previous grant money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.”
California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who hosted Monday’s news conference, described the lawsuit as the latest defensive move against what he called the Trump administration’s “little regard for the law.”
“In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks, eight of them challenge unlawful attacks on education,” Bonta said.
The coalition of attorneys general wants a federal judge to rule that the funding freeze is illegal, as well as order the federal government to release the money. A pair of court filings seeking both outcomes comprises over 180 pages, and describe the freeze as “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional.”
Neronha told reporters that, in Rhode Island’s case, the funding freeze comes at an especially inopportune time, with the state’s part-time legislature having just wrapped up its legislative session three weeks prior.
“It was a very difficult budget year,” Neronha said, with lawmakers forced to make tough fiscal decisions amid the state’s many money troubles, including an ailing health care infrastructure.
But Neronha said he hoped that the issue would be resolved “far, far, far before” legislators return for a new legislative session in January.
Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green, who denounced the funding freeze at a July 9 news conference, said Monday that the funding freeze “harms Rhode Island’s students, families, and teachers.” The loss of $29 million in congressionally approved aid means “there will be cuts” to before- and after-school programs, STEM learning, multilingual education, and professional development for teachers, Infante-Green said.
“Rhode Island students have been making significant strides in education progress, post-pandemic,” Infante-Green wrote in her statement. “Delays and cuts in federal funds put progress and momentum in every district in Rhode Island at risk.”
Taking legal action against the Trump administration is now routine for Democratic attorneys general. Neronha’s office has co-led or joined  26 lawsuits against the Trump administration since March. Maryland also has a hand in 26 suits, according to Brown’s office.
Asked by reporters about the likelihood of success in the present funding case, Neronha declined to predict an outcome.
“I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves and I don’t obviously want to speak for the court,” he said. “We have to make our points there as well. But based on the track record … we’ve seen this story before. We’ve been in the ring before with these sorts of cases and we’ve had great success because the violations of the law are so obvious.”

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) has tapped a Republican Carroll County commissioner and former Fort Meade commander to be the next head of the Department of Veterans and Military Families.
Ed Rothstein takes over as secretary on Aug. 1 from Acting Secretary Ross Cohen, who has been serving since the May departure of former Secretary Anthony C. “Tony” Woods.
Moore said in statement announcing the appiontment that Rothstein “has dedicated his career to serving this country and the people of Maryland,” and that he was honored Rothstein stepped forward to be the next secretary of Veterans and Military Families.
“Ed’s track record as a distinguished Army veteran and a devoted public servant demonstrates his commitment to live mission first, people always. During this next critical phase of our work, he will help lead our efforts to build a state that is safer, more affordable, more competitive – and one that leaves no one behind.”

Moore also thanked Cohen for stepping up to serve as acting secretary during the interim. Cohen is expected to return to his previous role as deputy secretary once Rothstein comes on board, Moore said.
Rothstein’s appointment drew praise from local and federal officials.
“He is a mission-driven strong leader who puts people first over bureaucracy,” former U.S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D) said in a statement. “Having served in the military for over 30 years, he knows military life and its impact on families. In my experience he knows how to make the policy and projects to ensure our military and veterans have what they need to lead their best lives.”
In addition to his assignment as a military intelligence officer, Rothstein served two years as garrison commander at Fort Meade.
“Ed Rothstein’s background to include his service to both this nation and Maryland make him the quintessential secretary to lead DVMF forward, serving Maryland veterans and families,” Del. Mike Rogers (D-Anne Arundel) said in a statement.
Following his departure from the military, Rothstein was president and CEO of the Anne Arundel County Economic Development Corporation. Later he was the executive director of the BWI Partnership.
Rothstein was elected to the Carroll County Board of Commissioners in 2018 and re-elected in 2022.
Carroll County Administrator Roberta Windham praised the appointment in a statement.
“His dedication to veterans and his passion for service is evident in everything he does. Carroll County’s Commissioners and I wish him all the best in his new role,” Windham said.
If confirmed by the Senate next year, Rothstein would become Moore’s second secretary for the agency, after Woods, who left the job in May to take a position with a private-sector technology startup.

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)The Trump administration has agreed to not distribute devices that turn semiautomatic rifles into machine guns in Maryland and 15 other states where they are illegal under state law.
Maryland led the lawsuit last month against the administration plan to return nearly 12,000 previously confiscated devices like forced-reset triggers installed on rifles that allow them to shoot up to 900 rounds per minute.
The planned return of the devices followed a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives settlement of a Biden-era lawsuit that claimed forced-reset were illegal. But in a court filing late last month, after the states sued, the ATF agreed it would not directly return the triggers to their owners in states where they’re illegal.
“It is unfortunate that litigation was necessary when the federal government could have made these commitments much earlier,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement Friday. “But I will do everything possible to keep Washingtonians safe from dangerous machine-gun conversion devices.”
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said that when the states filed their suit, in U.S. District Court for Maryland, his office “warned that thousands of forced reset triggers would flood our streets and leave Marylanders vulnerable to more senseless gun violence.”
Maryland gets one court win, joins two more suits against Trump administration

“Our case led the federal government to block their redistribution into Maryland and other states where they’re banned,” Brown said in a statement Friday. “This victory protects Maryland families from the devastation these dangerous devices have been used to inflict in our communities.”
The other states on the lawsuit were California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. The District of Columbia is also a plaintiff. Most of the states have laws banning forced reset triggers.
They argued the proliferation of these conversion devices in recent years has led to an increase in crimes committed with machine guns.
The Biden administration filed lawsuits against manufacturers and gun sellers and seized the devices from gun stores and individuals. The administration decided forced reset triggers were basically machine guns that are prohibited under federal law.
But last year, a federal judge in Texas disagreed, and ordered the Biden administration to return some of the conversion devices. The administration was complying but declined to send the triggers back to states where they’re illegal.
President Donald Trump accelerated that work, settling with manufacturers and agreeing to return the seized or surrendered devices to their owners across the country, including those convicted of felonies, the states’ lawsuit filed last month noted.
The states argued this would lead to more gun violence and force them to expend resources to confiscate the devices again. This would result in added costs for police and health care. Gun violence killed 737 Marylanders in 2023, according to federal data.
In a court filing, an ATF official wrote that there would be two notices for device owners. One will go to those in states where forced reset triggers are legal explaining how to get them returned.
The second, for those in states like Washington where they’re illegal, will give owners three options. They could request the ATF make the transfer to them in a state where it’s legal, request transfer to a third-party in a legal state or abandon the device. If an owner does not want a device returned, the federal government would destroy it.

The triggers also won’t be returned to people prohibited from possessing firearms.
Rare Breed Triggers, a main manufacturer and seller of forced reset triggers, also committed in court papers not to sell or ship its returned products into states where they’re illegal. The company’s president estimated the ATF took custody of at least $2.5 million worth of Rare Breed products.
Because of these commitments, on Friday, the states dropped their request in Maryland federal court for a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration’s return plans.

It doesn’t always look like force or desperation. Anyone can be a victim.,"When sex trafficking charges were brought against Sean “Diddy” Combs, it marked a rare and significant moment. Many advocates saw it as a step forward that prosecutors were willing to pursue trafficking charges—a move that’s still uncommon when there’s a romantic relationship involved.
Ultimately, the jury did not convict him on sex trafficking. They did, however, convict him under the Mann Act—a law related to transporting someone for commercial sex. While we don’t know exactly what the jury wrestled with, many legal experts believe the challenge came down to proving force, fraud, or coercion beyond a reasonable doubt. Especially when the survivor had a relationship with the perpetrator.
And that’s why I feel compelled to say this: The Diddy trial—and others like it before—have stirred up a lot of thoughts for me. And maybe for some of you, too. What strikes me most is that this basic truth still isn’t understood by everyone: 
You don’t have to be kicking and screaming (literally or metaphorically) to be a victim.
You can feel affection for the person who’s victimizing you. You can be in a relationship with them. You can even (believe you) love them. That doesn’t make the harm okay. It doesn’t make it any less of a crime.
In my daily work at Love146, an organization dedicated to ending child trafficking and supporting survivors, I know that most of the youth we serve in our Survivor Care have been victimized by someone they knew. Oftentimes by someone they trusted. And yes, sometimes even by someone they loved.
The presence of affection or consent at moments does not mean the whole story is clear of abusive and criminal components. And consent for some actions does not imply universal consent for all of them.
If you’re reading this and that feels obvious, I’m glad. It means we have a foundation in society (you!) to build on. At Love146, I’ve learned that this basic fact — that not all victimization is a situation of unceasing physical force — is obvious to most people when it comes to toddlers and young children. But do we understand it for all survivors?
I was victimized before starting kindergarten (my own experience wasn’t trafficking, but it was abuse). And even for that circumstance, the lie that I “didn’t fight back enough” has had power. The shame of not resisting more. The fear that I was complicit. Those are the lies many survivors carry.
So yes, we tend to get this when the child is five, six, eight. But do we get it when the victim is a teen? Do we understand this for adults? For boys and men?
Anyone can be a victim.
Victimization doesn’t always look how we think it will. It doesn’t always look like force or desperation. Survival often means trying to manage what feels inevitable. And deciding how to manage that can depend on whether someone believes you—whether they’ll understand that it wasn’t okay and if they’ll back you up.
If we want a better world, we have to grow in our understanding. I believe we can.
And to survivors reading this—especially those whose perpetrators weren’t tried or convicted, or were convicted of lesser charges: that verdict doesn’t define what happened to you.
Cassie and Jane Doe both testified for multiple days, sharing painful and detailed accounts. So many youth in Love146’s Survivor Care have opened up in ways that cost them dearly—emotionally, socially, and legally—only to watch their experience be minimized.
You know your story. You know what happened, and your experience is real, whether or not a courtroom called it trafficking.
We see you. We believe you. And we will keep walking forward, together.

In just the last several months, de-extinction — bringing back extinct species by recreating them or organisms that resemble them — has moved closer from science fiction to science fact. Colossal Biosciences — an American for-profit de-extinction startup headed by geneticists George Church and Beth Shapiro — announced two major achievements almost back-to-back.
In the first, scientists spliced part of the woolly mammoth’s genome into mice to create “woolly mice,” incredibly cute pom-pom like rodents sporting coats that express the genes of long-extinct woolly mammoths.

Just a few weeks later, Colossal announced an even bigger achievement, claiming to have brought back the dire wolf, a contemporary of the woolly mammoth who, like their Ice Age proboscidean co-travellers, last roamed the Earth roughly 10,000 years ago.
Mammoth popularity
Woolly mammoths are at the forefront of these controversial de-extinction efforts. Despite a deep bench of more recently extinct species — the dodo, the moa, passenger pigeons, the bucardo, quagga, thylacine, aurochs and a whole host of others — readily available to take centre stage in de-extinction efforts, woolly mammoths figure prominently in de-extinction stories, both scientific and popular.
Woolly mammoths featured prominently in the imagery of Revive & Restore, a “genetic rescue” conglomerate of scientists and futurists headed by tech-guru Steward Brand; in 2021, Colossal “established ownership” over woolly mammoth revival. Colossal’s own logo visualizes CRISP-R, the gene-splicing technology that facilitates de-extinction, and the signature spiralled tusks of Mammuthus primigenius.
In popular culture, woolly mammoths have been a source of fascination for the last several centuries. Thomas Jefferson famously held out hope that live mammoths would be found beyond the frontier of American colonialism in the late-1700s, while early excavations of American mastodons were major events in the early 1800s. American painter Charles Willson Peale captured the first such excavation in oils, and later capitalized on that mastadon’s skeleton in his Philadelphia museum.
More recently, Manny the mammoth featured in the ongoing Ice Age animated film franchise, first launched in 2002.
Climate icons
At the same time, woolly mammoths have also become an emblem of the contemporary climate crisis. During the recent wave of defacing famous artwork in order to draw attention to the climate crisis, environmental activists painted the (fortunately artificial) tusks of the Royal B.C. Museum’s woolly mammoth model bright pink.
In a 2023 publicity stunt, the Australian cultured-meat startup, Vow, unveiled a mammoth meatball produced out of the woolly mammoth’s genome with sheep DNA as filler. Not for sale, the mammoth meatball was scorched before an audience at the Dutch science museum, Nemo.
The stunt was intended to call attention, again, to the plight of the Earth’s climate, the unsustainability of industrialized food systems and the potential for lab-grown meat to square this particular circle.
Model animals
For a creature that no human being has ever seen live and in the flesh, woolly mammoths certainly get a lot of media exposure. How did this long-extinct species become the emblem of contemporary extinction and de-extinction?
People have been interacting with the remains of woolly mammoths for hundreds of years. Dig a hole deep enough almost anywhere in the northern hemisphere, and you are apt to come across the bones or maybe the tusks of extinct mammoths or mastodons.
In early modern Europe, mammoth fossils were famously interpreted as the bones of unicorns and giants before being recognized as belonging to elephant-like creatures around 1700. Only around 1800 were mammoths recognized as a distinct and extinct species of proboscidea.
Elsewhere in Arctic regions, especially Siberia, Indigenous Peoples were familiar with mammoth remains preserved by permafrost. As rivers and their tributaries surged during annual thaws, whole carcasses of mammoths (and woolly rhinos) were sometimes exposed.
Local peoples who came across these remains, apparently recently dead but belonging to creatures they never saw walking the Earth’s surface, surmised that they were great burrowing rodent-like animals that tunnelled through the ground and perished if they accidentally came into contact with atmosphere.
Around the Arctic, including in Alaska, permafrost prevented the fossilization of mammoth tusks as well as bodies, and this ice ivory was — and remains — an important element of Arctic economies, carved locally and exchanged into historically regional, and now global, markets.
Continued relevance
Despite their association with the distant past, woolly mammoths have long resonated with modern human cultures as their fossilized or preserved body parts entered economic practices and knowledge systems alike. But as the extinction of once numerous species like the passenger pigeon, the American bison and African elephant began to loom over the late 19th century, woolly mammoths took on new meanings in the context of modern extinction and emergent understandings of human evolution.

  A mural by by paleoartist Charles R. Knight depicting wooly mammoths, displayed at the American Museum of Natural History.(United States Geological Survey)


	Revolutions in geology, archeology, paleontology and related disciplines were changing long-held assumptions about the origin of humankind.
Narratives of the rise of “man the hunter” arose in natural history institutions such as the American Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum in Chicago. These origin stories were explicitly connected to the presumed extinction of woolly mammoths and their evolutionary relatives, the mastodons.
These led to some of the most powerful expressions of mammoths in visual form, like the frescoes and paintings produced by renowned paleoartist Charles R. Knight.
At the same time, cave paintings in France, Spain and elsewhere came to light in the early 20th century. For example, the 40,000-year-old frescoes at Rouffignac, France clearly depicting woolly mammoths were interpreted as further evidence of this deep and powerful historical connection.
It is this connection — the association of the rise of modern humankind with the decline and extinction of the woolly mammoth — that feeds today’s continued fascination. Notions of human complicity in extinction stories have long been embedded in modern scientific understandings of woolly mammoths. It is no accident that woolly mammoths are so central to de-extinction projects and climate activism alike.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)The Trump administration must allow refugees to enter the United States from countries covered by the president’s travel ban, a federal judge in Seattle ruled Monday.
U.S. District Court Judge Jamal Whitehead’s decision opens the door for around 80 refugees to immediately arrive from countries whose citizens are banned from traveling here. 
Whitehead also ruled the Trump administration needs to potentially allow refugees to enter the United States even if their planned travel was postponed before the president took office. 
Affected individuals and resettlement organizations, including Lutheran Community Services Northwest in Tacoma, brought the lawsuit after President Donald Trump halted refugee admissions via executive order on his first day in office.
In February, Whitehead, a Biden appointee, ruled the president’s order likely “crossed the line” of separation of powers. 
But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later narrowed Whitehead’s ruling to only allow the entry of refugees whose applications were approved before Trump signed the executive order. For refugees to enter the country under the appeals court ruling, they also needed clearance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and travel plans arranged at the time Trump issued his ban on refugee admissions. 
That decision from a three-judge 9th Circuit panel didn’t stop Trump from otherwise halting the United States Refugee Admissions Program.
Whitehead ordered the federal government to facilitate entry for refugees who met the appeals court’s three-prong test and had travel scheduled within two weeks of Trump’s order. The feds reported 160 people met those criteria. 
Magistrate Judge Michelle Peterson, of Seattle, will review the cases of others whose scheduled arrival date was after Feb. 3. This includes more than 4,000 cases comprising upward of 12,000 potential refugees.
The question before the district court was whether the Trump administration still needed to admit refugees from countries targeted in Trump’s early June travel ban. Refugees from these countries make up two-thirds of those who met the appeals court’s criteria but haven’t been admitted to the U.S. yet. 
One of the plaintiffs in the litigation is a Bellevue woman who filed an application to sponsor a refugee family from Afghanistan before the federal government suspended their case. Afghanistan is included in the president’s travel ban.
The organizations involved in the case also fear the Trump administration is undercounting the number of impacted refugees. They say the federal government isn’t including people whose travel plans were postponed for reasons other than the refugee ban, like application processing delays. And some plans may have been canceled in anticipation of the president’s actions.
The Trump administration countered in court documents that those refugees aren’t covered by the appeals court’s order. Department of Justice attorney Joseph McCarter called the request a “baseless and unrestrained expansion” of the ruling.
Whitehead ruled refugees whose travel plans were canceled between Dec. 1 and Jan. 20 are also covered by his order, paving a path for more to arrive in the United States. 
Within a week from Monday, the federal government must identify all cases meeting the appellate court’s three-part test, Whitehead ordered.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Josh Shapiro speaks to reporters Monday, July 14, 2025, before the state House voted on a budget bill. (Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Two weeks after the state budget deadline, lawmakers and Gov. Josh Shapiro said they’ve made progress in negotiations as the Democratic-controlled House advanced a $50.6 billion proposal to the GOP-led Senate.
It represents about a $900 million reduction in overall spending compared to Shapiro’s $51.5 billion proposal in February, but Republican House leaders said the bill is a largely procedural document and that more work remains to be done.
“This is not agreed to, but we are pleased that talks are continuing, moving in a direction that while it may seem slow and in fact is slow and frustrating for many of us, we do believe that there is some positive momentum,” House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said.
The Democratic majority’s lead budget negotiator, Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia), said lawmakers owed their constituents progress.
“The folks have already waited too long,” Harris said, noting that school districts across the commonwealth were forced to pass their budgets without knowing how much state funding they will get. “It is our responsibility to take a step forward, to show them that we’re not only working, but that we are ready to do what is necessary to get them a spending plan.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The general appropriations bill passed the House in a 105-97 vote with the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Mehaffie of Dauphin County, Kathleen Tomlinson of Bucks County, and Craig Williams of Delaware County.
A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) echoed the House Republicans’ view that the vote was primarily procedural and said the bill is not “a finished product.”
“Senator Pittman remains very upbeat and is actively engaged in discussions, however there is still much work to do,” spokesperson Kate Flessner said.
After meeting with House Democrats, Shapiro told reporters he had met Pittman and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) and said they had made good progress. He repeatedly declined to discuss specifics of the negotiations or how long it would take to reach a final agreement. 
“We all have an understanding of where we need to be on an overall spend, where we can make important investments we all want to make and also be cognizant of our fiscal situation,” Shapiro said.
Asked whether Democrats and Republicans had reached agreements on new revenue proposals, which include taxes on legal recreational marijuana and slot machine-like skill games, Topper demurred, saying his caucus is focused on strengthening the state’s economy.

“We’ve made it very clear that even if we didn’t increase spending a dime moving forward, our budgets in the future are unsustainable without economic growth,” he said.
According to a spreadsheet provided by Harris’ office, the House proposal makes cuts to line items throughout the budget while increasing spending on priorities such as K-12 education, the state university system, the Department of Transportation and state police. 
It also would increase Department of Human Services funding by nearly $4.5 billion in the face of federal cuts to Medicaid, which Shapiro said could devastate rural hospitals and nursing homes. The state would be unable to make up the loss in Medicaid funding.
The state Department of Human Services says cuts could result in more than 310,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage over the next decade. Some 270,000 could lose access to marketplace plans or face steep premium increases.
The House proposal would also increase public education funding by $930 million. The General Assembly last year committed to closing what it had identified as a $4.5 billion “adequacy gap” between the state’s wealthiest and highest performing school districts and about 370 under-funded districts.
The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education would receive a $40.4 million increase, about 6.5% more than last year’s budget. The Department of Environmental Protection would get a $130 million funding increase, or about 5.1% over last year.
The state police would see a $118 million increase. The proposal also includes a $16.3 million increase or 6.5% increase for PennDOT. Shapiro’s budget proposal called to continue a process of reducing the amount of fuel tax and license fees dedicated to the state police to make more money available for highways. That money is not reflected in the general appropriations bill.

The House also passed legislation to increase funding for public transportation by nearly $300 million by increasing the share of state sales tax dedicated to the state’s transportation trust fund. That money is also not reflected in the bill passed Monday.
Departments that would see an overall reduction in funding include: 

The governor’s office at $41 million or 7.4%
Agriculture at $5.9 million or 1.6%Drug and Alcohol Programs by $1.6 million or 0.4%
General Services at $16.1 million or 9%

Legislation transferring the land to the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources could lead to its reopening.(Elena Eisenstadt/Capital-Star)Neil Bogin bikes weekly on a portion of the rail trail in the Lehigh Gorge State Park in Carbon County. 
But, he has always steered clear of what sits just below it: the trailhead of one of the most popular, yet challenging hikes in the Pocono Mountains — Glen Onoko Falls trail. 
While tourists and locals have attempted and completed the hike, others like Bogin have avoided its 800 foot cliff along a series of waterfalls. “It was never safe,” even before they closed it down, he said. 
Glen Onoko has a reputation around Carbon County for its majestic views and steep incline, which draw experienced and inexperienced hikers alike. But, the trail frequently overwhelmed county emergency medical service agencies, who are largely staffed by volunteers.
  Neil Bogin said he’s steered clear of the Glen Onoko Falls trail because it’s not safe. (Elena Eisenstadt/Captial-Star)
On any given day, upwards of 50 volunteers would go to rescue people on the mountain.  Even after it was closed in 2019, some people continued walking the trail. In one instance in 2022,  a 72-year-old woman died. Rep. Doyle Heffley, (R-Carbon) said rescue missions have proven dangerous for emergency responders, as well as hikers stuck on the trail.
Now, Pennsylvania is one step closer to reopening the Glen Onoko Falls Trail after Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a bill in late June to incorporate the trail into Lehigh Gorge State Park. While the move provides the necessary land to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), funding in the state’s 2025-26 budget will ultimately determine the specific plans to improve the trail. 
“After a planning process and improvements, DCNR would reopen the Glen Onoko Falls Trail, increasing safe access to waterfalls and scenic views,” Wesley Robinson, DCNR press secretary, wrote in a statement to the Capital-Star.
The Pennsylvania Game Commission controlled the property, but the measure finalizes a land transfer to DCNR, which has more leeway to secure and maintain the trail.
As a result of this year’s land conveyance bill, the DCNR will transfer roughly 368 acres of land in Lehigh Township, Carbon County, to the Game Commission, in exchange for 495 acres of land that includes Glen Onoko in Nesquehoning Borough and Lehigh Township, Carbon County.
The Game Commission wrote in an April statement that it was unable to improve or reopen the trail, since its focus is on wildlife management and not natural resource management.
The land swap is fruitful for both parties, according to the agency, since the property that the commission will receive in exchange will offer better hunting opportunities than the steep land around Glen Onoko.

The community of Jim Thorpe has gained a reputation for its old-world charm and easy access to outdoor activities and people in the town are cautiously optimistic about the possibility of Glen Onoko Falls reopening. Shop owners and tourism advocates are looking forward to the economic gains, while they also stress the need for safety measures, given its grave history.
Neil Bogin, who has lived in Jim Thorpe for 20 years, is also excited about the potential reopening, but only, he said, “if it’s done right.”
Investing in tourism through state parks has been a priority for Shapiro throughout his first term as governor. His proposed 2025-2026 state budget includes $5 million in new funding for expanding and improving public lands, including Glen Onoko.

DCNR spokesperson Wesley Robinson declined to comment further about how the budget impasse will affect the proposed funding.
Pennsylvania’s outdoor recreation industry provided nearly $19 billion to the state’s economy in 2023, representing a two percent share of its gross domestic product, according to 2023 data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The industry sustains more than 168,000 jobs, which provide nearly $9 billion in salaries, according to the analysis. 
Outdoor recreational tourism has a significant impact on Carbon County alone, since it accounts for nearly 12% of the Pocono’s annual 30 million tourists visiting the area, according to Chris Barron, president of the Pocono Mountains Visitors Bureau.
Glen Onoko first became a popular tourist destination in the 1800s, when the Lehigh Valley Railroad offered train service to the falls. The Wahnetah Hotel — originally known as the Glen Onoko Tavern — provided a popular summer vacation spot nearby.
After decades as a quiet coal shipping community, Jim Thorpe, the closest neighboring town to Glen Onoko, began to see another tourism boom after the 1980s, said Beth Beers, owner of Everything Nice Gift Shop, which has been open for 40 years.
  (Elena Eisenstadt/Capital-Star)
Beers has seen tourism reshape Jim Thorpe over the decades. She remembers how most of Broadway, the main thoroughfare in town, was boarded up and empty. Now, tourism supports the economy with many mom-and-pop shops, like her own, she said.
Jim Thorpe has been chasing the tourism industry for decades. In 1954, the town renamed itself from Mauch Chunk to Jim Thorpe after the legendary Native American athlete who was laid to rest in the community with the hope of attracting more visitors.Thorpe, originally of the Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma, was sent to the Carlisle Indians Industrial School, which was designed to assimilate Native American children into society. According to the National Park Service, its mission was to “kill the Indian” to “save the Man.” A 2010 lawsuit challenged his burial site, arguing that his remains should have been returned to the Sac and Fox Nation.
Despite the economic benefit of outdoor tourism in the area, Glen Onoko’s natural gems have become off-limits in recent years because of the safety risks they pose.
“It’s been a major issue for quite some time. It’s a wonderful piece of property, and many people hike it,” Rep. Heffley said during the land conveyance bill’s final passage on the House floor in late June.
Heffley told the House about one incident where two people had died falling off the falls, but there were only enough EMS volunteers to recover one body. Another crew went back the next day for the second one.

“It got to the point where people were leaving the first responder service, because every weekend they would spend their whole weekend up there at this trail,” he said.
According to Heffley, the land transfer will allow more and safer access to the facility, which will in turn promote local tourism and relieve a burden on volunteer first responders.
“What we want to do is take this property, which is a liability right now to the Game  Commission, a liability to the residents in Carbon County, and turn it into an asset,” he said.
Shop owners and tourism advocates agree.
Brooke Lenker, executive director of the Keystone Trails Association, agrees. “Reopening a trail brings people, which brings dollars nearby,” she said.
James Lambert, assistant manager at Pocono Biking, says he thinks more people would visit if they had the chance to hike Glen Onoko. Even in its disrepair, “we definitely get people [who] ask about the trail and don’t even know it’s closed yet,” he said.
But from experience, he also knows it’s not an easy hike. “It’s sketchy,” Lambert said. “There’s definitely some parts that an experienced hiker is gonna have to really take their time and, like, work for it, but the views on it are awesome.”
According to Karen Bly, general manager of the Broadway Grille and Pub in Jim Thorpe, far too many amateur hikers attempt Glen Onoko without proper training or gear, she said.
If it did reopen, Bly hopes to see a park ranger stationed near the trail and a canteen to rent or buy gear at the base of the hike, borrowing an idea from some of the national parks she’s visited out west.

Speaking at the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, the Governor was joined by Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding and local farmers to announce the legal challenge and reaffirm his Administration’s commitment to defending Pennsylvania’s agricultural producers and ensuring continued access to healthy food for families in need.Two weeks after the Trump administration decided to pause $230 million in congressionally-approved funding for Pennsylvania’s schools, Gov. Josh Shapiro has joined a lawsuit to challenge the move.
Along with Pennsylvania, 24 states and the District of Columbia are challenging what they call the federal government’s unlawful withholding of funding for after-school programs, teacher training, literacy, and education for migrant and non-English speaking students.
“Every Pennsylvania child deserves the freedom to chart their own course and the opportunity to succeed,” Shapiro said. “Once again, the Trump Administration is trying to take away dollars that were committed to Pennsylvania — this time from our schools.”
The announcement came one day before the money was supposed to be made available to schools on July 1. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
There was no advance warning, according to Shapiro’s office. It also occurred days after the deadline for school districts in the commonwealth to approve their budgets.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the Education Department wrote to states. The notice did not provide any timeline — noting the funds are under review.
A total of $7 billion in funding earmarked for seven federal programs  is being withheld from schools across the country.
Pennsylvania’s share – $230 million – ranks sixth among the states after California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, according to an analysis by Education Week.
The state Education Department estimated the impact on commonwealth schools and other organizations that expected to receive the funds:

Title I-C, Migrant Education: $11 million
Title II-A, Supporting Effective Instruction: $70 million
Title III-A, English Language Acquisition: $20 million
Title IV-B, 21st Century Community Learning Centers: $54 million
Adult Education Basic Grants to States: $20 million

The federal dollars normally would go toward programs that benefit children affected by poverty through summer school and after-school tutoring and enrichment programs; immigrant students and English learners, children of migrant workers; youth in the foster care system and juvenile justice system; and adults seeking basic education as a pathway to post-secondary education and employment, according to the Shapiro administration.
Other states joining the lawsuit California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as Washington, D.C.
NC Newsline reports North Carolina joined the suit because it was out $165 million.
“Congress created these programs and authorized this funding,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson said. “The Department of Education does not have the authority to now withhold those funds, certainly not the night before they were set to arrive.”

Nicole Mitchell’s trial began on Monday July 14, 2025, in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, at the Becker County District Courthouse. (Photo by Jerry Holt/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photo.)DETROIT LAKES — During jury selection for the felony burglary trial of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, the Becker County prosecutor asked just a few questions of the 23 potential jurors as he sought to forecast who might be most receptive to his arguments.
Among them: “Would you agree that how the person was dressed is relevant to their intentions?” Brian McDonald asked. Many of the potential jurors nodded.
On the night she was arrested at her stepmother’s home for an alleged botched burglary, Mitchell was dressed in black clothing and a black hat, police say.
The detailed questions from McDonald — and Mitchell’s attorney Bruce Ringstrom, Jr. — underscored the importance both sides place on jury selection, which can often determine the outcome of a case before it even starts.
First, though, Seventh Judicial District Chief Judge Michael Fritz, presiding over the first floor courtroom, sought to determine if the prospective jurors could rule fairly.
In a move befitting a case that’s been widely covered across the state, Fritz asked the prospective jurors to raise their hands if they have heard of the case against Mitchell. Of the 23 prospective jurors sitting in the jury box who were being questioned, 15 raised their hands in the affirmative.
The case has garnered statewide media coverage since Mitchell’s arrest in April 22, 2024, after police say they found her in the basement of her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home at about 4:45 a.m. Police say she told them during her arrest that she was attempting to retrieve some of her late father’s possessions, including his ashes, according to the amended criminal complaint.
Fritz conducted his own questioning to determine what the potential jurors had heard of the case and whether that would bias them for or against Mitchell. Fritz called each of the 15 jurors who raised their hands into the courtroom to face individual questioning, asking whether they could issue a verdict based on evidence in the case, not what they’ve watched on the news or read on social media.
“You understand that the news isn’t evidence and you understand you must rule based on what you hear in trial?” Fritz asked each of the 15 jurors. All said they understood, and they could do that.
“It’s been on the news a lot,” one juror told the judge.
Ringstrom, Mitchell’s attorney, asked in a follow-up question whether the juror believed Mitchell could receive a fair trial in Becker County or whether she would hold it against the defense that they didn’t attempt to move the trial.
“Given the news coverage, I’m not sure anywhere in Minnesota would be better than Becker County,” she responded.
The trial could test jurors’ ability to set aside partisan identities. Mitchell, a suburban Democrat, is being tried in a county that went for President Donald Trump last year by 33 percentage points.
Ringstrom spent nearly four hours questioning the jurors. He asked whether they’ve been the victim of a burglary, what burglary meant to them and whether they knew anyone with dementia or Alzheimer’s.
The defense plans to argue that Carol Mitchell, Nicole Mitchell’s stepmother, has a deteriorating memory and is an unreliable witness. In the days following her arrest, Nicole Mitchell said she drove up to Detroit Lakes to conduct a welfare check on Carol Mitchell, but she startled her stepmother, who she says has Alzheimer’s and related paranoia.
“Have you ever had the experience of someone very convinced of a memory that wasn’t true?” Ringstrom asked one juror who said she worked with dementia patients.
He also asked whether the prospective jurors would look unfavorably upon Ringstrom if he aggressively cross-examined a person who “does have or probably does have dementia,” alluding to the fact that he intends to ask tough questions of Carol Mitchell and her memory of the alleged break-in.
“I’m afraid you’re going to hold it against Nicole Mitchell if I ask questions too aggressively,” Ringstrom told the prospective jurors. Multiple prospective jurors said that it depends on the circumstances.
During the questioning, Ringstrom asked the jurors to raise their hand to indicate whether they believe politicians should be held to a higher standard compared to regular citizens.
“Is there any reason that someone facing a criminal accusation should have a higher burden on them if they’re a politician rather than a citizen facing the same charge?” Ringstrom asked.
Multiple jurors said “no,” and that they believe the law should apply to everyone uniformly.
McDonald, the Becker County Attorney asked the potential jurors fewer questions, including whether anyone had been involved in a disagreement over an inheritance.
Roderick Mitchell, Nicole Mitchell’s father, died without a will in 2023, according to the criminal complaint. A probate court awarded Carol Mitchell 100% of Roderick Mitchell’s estate.
McDonald, building upon Ringstrom’s questioning about whether politicians should be held to a higher standard, asked the jurors whether they believed lawyers were in a better position to know the law. Multiple jurors nodded their heads.
This is relevant because Nicole Mitchell herself is an attorney. McDonald asked jurors whether the time or day or night is relevant as to why a person allegedly broke into a home. Multiple jurors said yes.
Finally, he asked about Mitchell’s black garb, which internet cutups have compared to that of a cat burglar.
At the end of the day Monday, the prosecution and defense seated 15 jurors — 10 men and five women. Only 12 jurors are going to deliberate a verdict; the remaining three are alternates.
Mitchell has pleaded not guilty to first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools. If convicted, Mitchell faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. If found guilty of possession of burglary tools she faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison.

According to Curt Lindberg, chair of the Waitsfield Conservation Commission, the project spans a cumulative 260 worksites across the region.

MAD RIVER VALLEY — For the past seven years, volunteers have been pulling and clipping Japanese knotweed from riverbanks, open fields, roadsides and plenty of places in between.
They’re part of a joint effort between conservation commissions in three towns — Waitsfield, Warren and Fayston — to fight the invasive plant, which has taken hold along the Mad River Valley.
More recently, project leaders have enlisted a helping hoof: goats that can eat the knotweed up.    
Goat grazing is a known method to control invasive plants without machinery. Goats feed on the plants, weakening or killing them entirely. In 2024, the Mad River Valley effort hired Mary Beth Herbert to do the job. This year, she’s funded by a grant from the Lake Champlain Basin Program.

According to Curt Lindberg, chair of the Waitsfield Conservation Commission, the project spans a cumulative 260 worksites across the region. Interns from the University of Vermont as well as local volunteers have been working, along with the goats, to control knotweed across the locations.
Herbert got her start with keeping goats in 2018 while working as a trail crew leader on the Appalachian Trail in the south of the state. She got interested in working with goats because of frequent machine failures on the job that set the crew behind.
She spent around five years camping on the trail with her goats, half the time as a volunteer, the other half paid.
In the same year she and her three goats — Ruth, Bader and Ginsberg, after the former U.S. Supreme Court justice — were hired by the city of Montpelier to remove poison ivy.
In the winter of 2023, Herbert gave away her then 23-strong herd and moved to Arizona to study with Navajo shepherds.

That spring, she was contacted by the Mad River knotweed operation to help rid the area of the invasive.
When efforts to remove knotweed first started out, locals found it challenging and had thought, “‘Why even bother,’” said Lindberg.
But in the past few years there has been a shift in perspective.
“With good persistent effort, you can make progress,” Lindberg said.
This year, Herbert has a herd of 18 goats, 14 of which she owns and four she has rented from Villa Villekulla Farm in Barnard.
The knotweed is extensive and dense, especially along the river.
On a recent day near the Mad River Exchange in Waitsfield, Herbert walked along a wooded trail toward the riverside clearing where her crew has been stationed this summer. Unlike the land around it, the field hasn’t been overwhelmed by knotweed; the patches are shorter and more spread out.
Piles of knotweed rhizomes and clippings by the Mad River. Photo by Lindsey Papasian
She’s been rotating the herd around the perimeter to prevent the invasive from growing any further.   
“I already see a difference from last year to this year,” she said.
Around the field, knotweed grazed on four weeks ago had grown back to chest height while further away, ungrazed plants stood at least 6 feet high. 
Unlike poison ivy, which can be grazed heavily one time, Knotweed needs more regular maintenance to suppress the spread. 
“Knotweed needs to be grazed many, many times, over and over,” Herbert said.
Increased flooding in Vermont is worrisome to both her and Linberg for how it could fuel the spread of the invasive.

That’s because when floodwaters pass over riverbanks with a population of Japanese knotweed, they can carry rhizomes — the part of the plant that grows new roots and shoots — downstream, where the invasives can replant themselves into the soil and spread the network further. 
The field where Herbert is working is public land that could turn entirely into knotweed if left unmanaged. 
“The goal is to work where people used to go and can’t anymore because of the knotweed and reclaim” those spots, Herbert said. 
The goats will be spending all summer eating knotweed around the field. They are moved every two or three days from one spot to another and cycle to previously grazed spots around every four weeks. On that recent afternoon, goats followed Herbert around as she kicked knotweed down to make it easier for them to reach.
“I’m happy because the goats absolutely love the knotweed,” Herbert said.

She sees animal husbandry as the most important part of her job. She trims the goats’ hooves, makes sure they get enough nutrition in their diet and sets up electric fences every time they are moved to keep them from wandering away or encountering coyotes.
Each year the knotweed is getting weaker in places the volunteers are working, Lindberg said. In some roadside spots, where the weed can’t spread as easily as by water, volunteers have eradicated the plant, he said.
Interns and volunteers are set to fight the knotweed into September. In October, volunteers will plant native plants. 
“The goal is to restore healthy, native habitat,” Lindberg said.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Speeding-related traffic fatalities have increased in Louisiana, and younger male drivers have accounted for most of the deaths, according to a new federal traffic study.
The Louisiana Highway Safety Commission announced Monday the latest findings of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s report on speeding-involved wrecks for 2023. It determined the state is now above the national average for its rate of fatal crashes involving speeding. The study comes out annually and compiles each state’s vehicle accident statistics from two years prior, the latest data available. 
The NHTSA study found speeding was involved in 30% of all motor vehicle fatalities in Louisiana in 2023, a seven percentage point jump from the prior year’s rate. Louisiana’s rate was 29% in 2021, 23% in 2020 and 13% in 2019.
The latest increase pushed the state slightly above the national average of 29%, which has held since 2020. 
“We have a message for speeding drivers: Chill out and slow down!” Louisiana Highway Safety Commission Executive Director Lisa Freeman said in a news release.
Louisiana plays a ‘wait-and-see game’ after approving a slate of bills to lower insurance rates

Officials reported 240 traffic deaths in Louisiana that involved speeding. Nearly 83% of those fatalities occurred on non-interstate roads, the study found.
Young male drivers in the 15-20 age group are significantly more likely to be involved in speeding-related fatalities than other drivers. Accounting for 37% of speeding deaths, they are more than twice as likely to die in a speeding incident than females in the same age group, according to the report.
The risk of death becomes more pronounced when a motorcycle is involved. According to the NHTSA, 36% of all motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes in 2023 were speeding, compared with 22% of all passenger automobile drivers in deadly wrecks. Motorcycle riders 21-24 years old were speeding in 54% of their fatal crashes.
Freeman also noted state and national statistics consistently show speeding drivers killed in crashes often were not wearing seat belts.
“It is a deadly combination,” Freeman said. “Just taking a few extra seconds to buckle up and driving the speed limit can make a world of difference.”

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)FRISCO, Colo. – U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado was headed out of a fundraiser here Friday evening, on his way to a town hall with U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, when he was asked by Newsline to respond to criticism that he has not been tough enough on the Trump administration.
“Anybody who has watched me lead the fight against (Health and Human Services Secretary) Bobby Kennedy, lead the fight against (Director of National Intelligence) Tulsi Gabbard, lead the fight against the Secretary of Defense (Pete Hegseth’s) insane use of Signal for battle plans, would know that I’ve been fighting this administration incredibly hard and will continue to fight them incredibly hard,” Bennet said.
Term-limited Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, Bennet’s leading challenger in the 2026 Democratic primary race for Colorado governor, told Newsline before a fundraiser in Edwards on July 5 that his more than two dozen lawsuits challenging Trump make him uniquely qualified to stand up for the state as governor.
“Having been very supportive of a lot of the (Trump) nominees and having said when he announced that he thinks a winning strategy is to make nice with the Doug Burgums of the world is not going to look great in a primary where people believe this administration is lawless, reckless and harmful,” Weiser said of Bennet, referring to the secretary of the Interior Department. “(Voters are) going to look at who’s actually standing up to this administration and who’s essentially trying to make nice.”

Bennet was first appointed to the Senate in 2009 to replace former Sen. Ken Salazar, who was chosen by the Obama administration to serve as Interior secretary. Bennet has since won reelection twice and is slated to serve in the upper chamber of Congress until early 2029. If he wins the June 2026 Democratic primary, Bennet would be a heavy favorite against a crowded Republican field.
If Bennet wins in November of 2026, he would have to resign his seat in the U.S. Senate to occupy the Colorado governor’s office, where current Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is term-limited. At that point, Bennet would then select his replacement in the Senate.
It’s the economy
Bennet on Friday pushed back on the notion that opposing President Donald Trump is the biggest key to winning in Colorado.
“I think fighting the administration is only part of what we need to do,” Bennet said. “We need to have a positive vision for what this country is going to be. And the way we’re going to get there is by building an economy that works for everybody — not just the people at the very top – but especially the next generation of Coloradans.”
Bennet says young voters turned on Democrats across the country in 2024 — at least enough to swing the election to Trump for a second term — because of the economy.
“There’s not a county in Colorado where people feel like their kids are going to be able to afford to live there,” Bennet said. “That’s where the seeds of Trumpism are sown, is in an economy where people feel like no matter how hard they work they don’t have economic opportunities.”
Weiser, who announced his campaign for governor right out of the gate in January, argues Bennet is needed more in the Senate and that he should serve out the term he was elected to because his seniority there makes him an invaluable asset for Colorado in Washington.
“I know our state government inside and out, from every agency to every issue,” Weiser said. “I can hit the ground running. Michael Bennet will have a huge learning curve if he’s to do this job.”
Bennet counters that he brings considerable experience in the private sector, where he was managing director of Anschutz Investment Company; experience in the public sector, as the superintendent of Denver Public Schools and three terms in the Senate; and relationships with leaders in and out of government all over the state — all of which will help him “make big changes” in housing, health care and education in Colorado.
As for picking his replacement in the Senate, Bennet did not name names, although he had high praise for House Assistant Minority Leader Neguse, who stopped into Bennet’s fundraiser before heading off to his nearby town hall.
‘They’re going to be bullies‘
Asked about the suggestion that he clear the primary field in exchange for a nomination to the U.S. Senate, Weiser said that does not interest him.
“I don’t want to be in the Senate,” Weiser said. “I’ve said publicly that if that situation arises, I’m not the right person. They’re better people for the job. Pick one of them. Don’t pick me.”
Weiser is adamant, nearly a year from the primary, about the right order of things in the state of Colorado: “Michael Bennet staying in the Senate, me serving as our next governor. That’s the best move for Colorado. I don’t think Michael Bennet’s the right person to be governor. That’s why I’m in this race.”
Bennet is not taking Weiser lightly in the primary contest.
“I’m today more than 30 points ahead in the primary, but I’m fighting like I’m 30 points behind, which is what I always do,” Bennet said. 
Referring to an internal Bennet campaign poll released last month and showing the senator with a more than 30-point lead over the attorney general as “a static, one-point-in-time, year-before-an-election” snapshot, Weiser said, “What it’s not capturing is the building energy and momentum that is going to drive our campaign.”
The Bennet campaign on Monday reported raising more than $1.7 million in the second quarter, setting an off-year record in Colorado and ending the quarter with more than $1.3 million in cash on hand. The Weiser campaign on July 2 reported raising more than $1 million in the second quarter, which it ended with nearly $2.5 million cash on hand.
For now, Weiser not only wants to see Bennet stay in the Senate, he also wants all of the Democrats in the upper chamber, including Colorado’s junior U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, to fight harder against the “lawless” Trump administration.
“I would definitely urge senators to be more combative and not try to be accommodating with this administration,” Weiser said. “Accommodation is not a strategy that’s going to work. This administration has shown time and again, they’re going to be lawless. They’re going to be bullies. We’ve got to stand strong and fight back, and senators have to find all the best ways to do that.”
Bennet says he’s up for that fight but can more effectively wage it in Denver.
“I am extremely well-situated to be able to provide the leadership that Colorado needs right now at a moment when we are painting against a canvas that is what Donald Trump represents and the future that he represents,” Bennet said. “In Colorado, we can not only make sure that this place is a place that every one of our kids can call home and can thrive in and build their own lives here, but we can set an example for the rest of the country. And that’s a valuable opportunity for us.”

TOPEKA — Mickel Cherry interrupted his confession to smothering and sexually assaulting a child to ask a Topeka police detective to execute him.
Video of that October 2023 interrogation and a series of letters written by the defendant while in custody at the Shawnee County Jail were presented Monday by the district attorney to build the foundation of a case for sentencing Cherry to consecutive 25-year-to-life terms for the murder of 5-year-old Zoey Felix.
“Shoot me in my head,” Cherry urged Detective Cory Deedrick, hours after law enforcement descended on the Topeka crime scene and began undermining Cherry’s false allegation that a Hispanic man in black clothing attacked the girl.
“I never wanted to hurt her,” said Cherry, who tapped his forehead on a desk. “I wasn’t myself when it happened. I just want to f***ing die.”
In the jailhouse letters placed into evidence, Cherry asserted his mind was slipping deeper into a dark void. He sought family forgiveness for his actions. In hard-to-read script, he said he was preparing for his own death. He wrote that he was haunted by the voice of a child who had started referring to her part-time babysitter as an “uncle.”
“I still hear her voice calling me, ‘Why uncle?’ ” one of Cherry’s letters said.
Cherry, 27, avoided capital punishment by entering guilty pleas in late 2024 to first-degree felony murder and rape of the 63-pound child with a bubbly personality.
The remaining legal battle in the prosecution of Cherry centers on what minimum length of time must elapse before he could be considered for parole from a Kansas prison. The answer could come Tuesday from District Judge Jessica Heinen on the hearing’s second day.
 
The legal battle
The judge must decide whether Cherry received concurrent or consecutive “hard 25” sentences.
District Attorney Mike Kagay’s sentencing brief said there was no rigid blueprint for determining when consecutive sentencing was appropriate, but case law suggested it was acceptable when “not arbitrary or based on an error.”
“Kansas courts defer heavily to the sentencing judge’s discretion, especially when the record reflects heinous crimes or distinct criminal conduct justifying a consecutive sentence,” he said.
Defense attorney Peter Conley said records from the Texas foster care system showed Cherry’s abusive upbringing before and while placed in the Texas foster care system should be taken into account and allow for the sentences on the murder and rape charges to run at the same time.
Conley said the Kansas Department for Children and Families investigated Zoey’s welfare seven times but didn’t do what was necessary to place the girl in protective custody.
“The failures of these systems increased her vulnerability,” Conley said.
He said he attempted to subpoena a DCF records custodian to testify on Monday, but nobody from the state agency responded.
In a separate matter, the district attorney’s office denounced a presentencing brief filed by Conley that concluded Kagay’s office had directed DCF not to proceed with a child-in-need-of-care investigation into Zoey’s well-being.
Attorney Keith Henderson, on behalf of the district attorney, said Conley’s statement was “factually and legally inaccurate” and fell “far below the standard of candor and integrity expected of an officer of the court.”
“Defense counsels’ statements in that portion of their brief are dangerous and disingenuous,” wrote Henderson, who sought a correction. “They are unworthy of a member of the bar.”
In court, Conley said the statement in the defense brief needed to be clarified to say either the district attorney or law enforcement officers in Topeka were complicit in the decision not to proceed with a process that could have saved Zoey from harm.
 
Focusing on Zoey
Aimee Slusser, who described herself as a mentor to Zoey, said during a victim impact statement that she didn’t want squabbling about Cherry’s mental health challenges to be the focus of sentencing.
“I want everyone to remember who she was,” Slusser told the court. “This is about a little girl’s life.”
During the hearing, several people in the gallery wept while law enforcement officers and medical personnel presented evidence drawn from telephone records, interviews with witnesses and forensic examinations.
Cherry wore yellow jail coveralls and was shackled with chains that remained on despite the presence of six law enforcement officers in the courtroom. He periodically slumped forward to peer at the floor and tilted his head back to stare at ceiling lights. There were times when Cherry nodded his head as if agreeing with the prosecution.
Law enforcement narrated a triangulated set of surveillance videos taken from the perspective of a grocery store, fuel station and restaurant.
Witnesses filled in blanks of a five-hour period that began when Zoey’s father, Ezequiel Felix, entrusted her to Cherry’s care. One segment of the video captured Zoey and Cherry walking side-by-side. It ended with Cherry carrying the girl’s lifeless body, apparently from the two-tent homeless camp, to the gas station where the girl’s father worked.
Next to gasoline pumps, a good Samaritan and later a Topeka emergency crew responding to a 911 call attempted CPR. She was pronounced dead at Stormont Vail Health.
Cherry was questioned by Topeka officers at the scene, where a police body camera first recorded Cherry blaming a Hispanic man for harming the girl while she slept in a blue car. He claimed to have ran the man off. He asserted that he found Zoey not breathing inside the vehicle.
Cherry, who wasn’t wearing a shirt, was asked about a spot of blood that appeared on his stomach.
“I honestly don’t know,” he said. “I have a condition that sometimes I bleed from the belly button.”
He later admitted under questioning by police at the station that the story blaming an unknown assailant was a lie and his assault on Zoey occurred in a tent where homeless people had taken refuge. He said he suffocated the girl with a pillow.
“Something came over me and I did the unimaginable,” Cherry told Detective Deedrick. “Something I thought I’d never do.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mickel-Cherry-murder-sentencing-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 20:05:30.542415

Attorney General Charity Clark joined a 24-state lawsuit against the Trump administration for allegedly “unlawfully freezing” $26 million in federal education funding for Vermont schools, and over $6 billion nationwide, according to a press release Monday.The lawsuit, which includes Vermont as a plaintiff alongside 23 other states and Washington D.C., accuses the Trump administration of illegally halting funds for six federal education funding programs previously approved by Congress.The six grants in question vary in scope and mission. They include supporting after school and summer programs, educating children of legal migrants, training teachers to work with working class students and students of color, school conditions and drug-prevention for low-income and inner-city schools, adult literacy and education and instruction for English language learners.

The lawsuit states that funding for the six programs must be made available to schools on July 1 so they are able “to staff, to supply materials for, and to prepare facilities for the imminent school year.” The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration sent a “boilerplate three-sentence e-mail,” on June 30 that halted funding, citing a review of this year’s awards to ensure the money spent on these programs is “In accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”This marks the 22nd lawsuit Clark has filed against the Trump administration. Clark has been one of several attorney generals to file visible, cross-state lawsuits in order to preserve federal funding for their respective states.“Once again, the President wishes to unconstitutionally undo appropriations made by Congress,” Clark said in the release. “The President does not have the power to freeze these funds – funds that Vermont schools are counting on.”

(Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.

The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Emergency managers in Ruidoso reported three flash flood impacts Monday afternoon in the Ruidoso area following a new round of warnings and evacuations in the region still reeling from deadly floods last week.
Around 2 p.m. meteorologists and local officials urged the public to seek higher ground in Ruidoso and the Mescalero Apache Reservation. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the South Fork Fire burn scar until 4 p.m., saying slow-moving thunderstorms had formed over the area.
Echoing the warning, the Village of Ruidoso Facebook page told residents that “This is a dangerous and life threatening situation. Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.”
The impact of the flash floods remained unclear as of Monday afternoon.. NWS data shows emergency managers reported three separate roads were flooded or covered in debris between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., including Cedar Creek Drive and Main Road and a third, unspecified road in the southern part of town that had to be closed due to debris.

The village also announced that gates to Gavilan Canyon were closed due to the floodwaters, and they warned the public that “rapidly rising floodwaters” were reported in the Upper Canyon and Brady Canyon areas.
In addition to Ruidoso, Mescalero officials reported flooding at the tribe’s community center, tribal store, gas company and the “empowerment complex,” a community hub for resources. The tribe ordered everyone there to evacuate immediately.
The National Weather Service’s flash flood warning expired at 4 p.m., though recent forecasts predict isolated flash flooding across most of Southern New Mexico until sunset at 8:21 p.m. on Monday.
The floods come after three people were killed and homes destroyed in the latest round of post-fire flooding to hit the area since the South Fork and Salt fires last summer.

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)School districts in New Mexico are doing a much better job at maintaining their school buildings compared with 15 years ago, a state official told lawmakers on Monday.
Larry Tillotson, deputy director for operations, outreach and quality assurance at the state Public Schools Facilities Authority, said more than $3.1 billion in state funding has gone into school maintenance in the past 23 years, resulting in reduced health and safety issues and improved staff morale.
“Our facilities managers are taking better care of their investments; they’re taking better care of the educational environments across the board,” Tillotson told the interim legislative Public School Capital Outlay Oversight Task Force on Monday.
Every five years, the Public Schools Facilities Authority’s assessors inspect every school building across 91 school districts in the state, totaling more than 62 million square feet of building space.
They find problems like broken fire alarms; clogged air filters that haven’t been switched out; leaking swamp coolers; or potholes in parking lots, Tillotson said. They follow up with school districts over the following two months to encourage them to fix problems, he said.
Their findings go into a Facilities Maintenance Assessment Report, which scores the district on a scale from 0% to 100%.
School districts must achieve a 70% rating to receive funding from the Public Schools Facilities Authority, Tillotson said. That rating indicates that districts are maintaining their building systems at a level that keeps them running through their expected useful life, he said. Reaching a higher rating means those systems will last longer than expected, he said.
Tillotson’s presentation to the task force shows, at this point in the inspection process, the average rating across all school districts lies at over 76%.
In the first five-year inspection period that began in 2011, the average rating was 57%, putting the average New Mexico school district in the “poor” category, the presentation states. At that time, the majority of school districts were failing to maintain their buildings, Tillotson said.
Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) told the committee on Monday she was thrilled to hear the report, and that she was shocked to see the improvement since 2011.
“I’ve been waiting for this for years,” she said. “We’ve been so bad at maintenance.”
The districts in the “marginal” and “poor” categories lack the staff needed to manage their buildings, or don’t have supervisors in their maintenance departments, Tillotson said.
In the current assessment cycle, nine districts fell into the “marginal” category, including Taos, Tularosa and Loving; and three ranked as “poor”: Questa, Hagerman and Pojoaque Valley.
“Many of our school districts are just not there yet,” Tillotson said.
In the latest round of inspections, Hobbs Municipal Schools scored the highest, at over 97%, putting it in the “outstanding” category.
“What that tells us is they’re taking extreme care of the educational environment,” Tillotson said. “Across the board, they’re doing a wonderful job.”
Other districts with ratings similar to Hobbs’ include Farmington, Clovis and Central Consolidated Schools in Shiprock, the presentation states. Tillotson said Hobbs school officials even went so far as to ask other districts how they could help them improve their scores.
The high score also means Hobbs will save money on maintaining its school buildings after it became the first school district ever to achieve “exemplary maintenance,” Tillotson said.
This unlocked a 5% reduction in how much money Hobbs must pay to match maintenance funding from the state, Tillotson said.
“Good maintenance efforts are critical to ensuring the delivery of good quality educational environments for our students and staff, and to provide those safe, functional learning and teaching environments,” Tillotson said.
Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces) told the committee that when education is generally underfunded, district-level officials have to decide whether to pay for a teacher in the classroom or a maintenance worker.
“Hiring teachers, social workers, counselors, educational assistants — all of those are part of the decision, as well as the maintenance portion of it,” he said. “We need to make sure that districts have the financial resources to do both, and not have to make those terrible decisions.”

A Superior Court judge dismissed, in part, the Pownal Center Community Church’s complaint against the town in an ongoing property rights dispute.
Through a lawsuit filed in April, representatives from the church aimed to shed light on the property rights of the historic building established in 1790 and connected land, and called for the town to renounce any outstanding ownership claims to the property.  
In the July 2 ruling, Judge David Barra asserted the church failed to demonstrate sufficient rights to the congregation’s site of worship for all but the carriage shed adjoining the property. 
The church has 30 days to amend the complaint to bring forth “factual allegations” and better explain the “‘inherent vagueness and complexities of title to land in Vermont’ that may entitle (the) Church to relief or quiet title,” according to the ruling.

In the original complaint filed April 4 by attorney Evan Chadwick, the church claimed it had rights to the property because it had continuously used the building for more than 15 years.
Chadwick further argued that the church held legal rights to the property going back to 1790, when the church was first established, as the land was set aside as a glebe, or parcel for the Church of England, in 1760. 
The town stopped using the church basement for meetings in 1991 and built a municipal office in 2021. The church has maintained the property since 1951 and held insurance on the property since 1980, according to the complaint. 
Chadwick also pointed to the church trustees’ and Pownal community’s possession of a deed to the carriage shed on the southwest corner of the property since 1905, according to the complaint. The town refused to sign a quitclaim deed for the carriage shed property in 1976, agreeing that the town “held no title interest” in that section of the property.
In the July ruling, Barra wrote that the “Church has only stated a plausible claim for the ‘carriage shed’ portion of the Property.”
Barra ruled that the assertion of the property as glebe land does not mean the church has a legal right to the entire property. The church also did not establish a legal claim under the state’s time limit for land recovery and exemption of public lands from recuperation through continuous use, Barra ruled.
Pownal town officials and Chadwick declined to comment.

(Pool photo by Manuel Rodriguez/FOX 13 News)After the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Utah’s lawsuit seeking to take over 18.5 million acres of federally-controlled land within its boundaries in January, a pending suit from environmentalists continues, now asking lower courts to prevent the state from filing a similar case in the future.
The state hasn’t filed a new lawsuit in a federal lower court as the Supreme Court suggested. And it may or may not pursue a new filing, Lance Sorenson, an attorney representing the state, said at a Monday court hearing. 
Now, without a lawsuit, 3rd District Court Judge Thaddeus May might have to decide whether Utah’s executive branch can file a similar suit in the future. But, first, the court has to consider whether to allow the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) to amend its original complaint against the state, now that the Supreme Court has dismissed the case.

“Maybe the burning question is, ‘when will that case get refiled?’ I can tell you, it’s under consideration, but it’s not guaranteed that it will even be filed again,” Sorenson said. “And so as we stand here today, there is no federal lawsuit, and there may never be one, which I think underscores our argument that there’s really no case here.”
But, according to SUWA, the state’s request itself is unconstitutional since the Utah Constitution establishes that state inhabitants “forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands” within its borders.
U.S. Supreme Court will not hear Utah’s lawsuit to control 18.5 million acres of public land

“If the suit is unknown, why is it not better to wait for that suit to be filed in federal court and then have a reaction? Why does this court have to preempt that decision or that lawsuit?” the judge asked Jess Krannich, an attorney representing the environmental group.
Public statements from Utah officials “crystallized a legal position that is 180 degrees opposite what is in the Utah constitution in its plain language,” Krannich said.
“The basic claim is the Utah Constitution plain language limits authority in this space, and therefore the state actors are acting contrary to Utah law, binding Utah constitutional law, if they take the action that they took, and then they’re saying that they’re going to take again,” Krannich said. “That’s the gist of it.”
Rather than “taking an act that is completely foreclosed by the Utah Constitution,” the court could comment on the issue, and the state could take the appropriate steps to amend its constitution, Krannich said. 



Let us know what you think...


 


However, for the state, the original SUWA complaint is moot since the U.S. Supreme Court already dismissed the state’s first suit. SUWA’s request to amend its complaint would be “futile,” since it wouldn’t withstand a motion to dismiss, the state argued in court documents.
Additionally, Sorenson said, the remedies SUWA is requesting are beyond the court’s power to grant “because the court can’t craft an unconstitutional remedy.”
“If the federal courts were to find that Utah’s lawsuit has merit, they would be finding that Gov. Cox and Attorney General Brown are not precluded from bringing the lawsuit,” Sorenson said. “And such a ruling from a federal court under the Supremacy Clause would take precedence over any contrary ruling from this court.”
How much is Utah’s public lands lawsuit and PR campaign costing taxpayers? 

If, on the other hand, federal courts determine that Utah’s hypothetical future lawsuit doesn’t have merits, SUWA’s claims would be moot since there wouldn’t be any damages to begin with, Sorenson said. 
“It’s also helpful to know what Utah did request in its lawsuit, which was not to transfer title to Utah, it was to start disposing the land as it had done for hundreds of years prior under federal constitutional doctrines of equal sovereignty, so that the land gets disposed,” Sorensen said. “We don’t know how the land would get disposed of. Maybe they would sell it to SUWA, right? It’s all that’s speculative.”
That would imply opening up the old Federal Land Office or taking other actions to make dispositions available, Sorenson said.
After the hearing, Steve Bloch, legal director with SUWA, said that was a highlight of the state’s arguments, especially after Utah officials spent over $1 million on legal fees and a public relations campaign that includes billboards, print, TV and radio ads, since filing the lawsuit against the U.S. government last summer.  
“The focus of its campaign was ‘stand for our land,’ ‘keep Utah lands in Utah hands.’ And what the attorney for the state of Utah said this morning is, ‘that’s wrong. That’s actually not what they’re after here,’” Bloch said. “In their federal court filing, in the position that they’ve now stated in court here, they want to force the sale of federal lands into private hands, full stop.”

(Photo by Nicole Girten/Daily Montanan) Last week, Eric Jacobsen visited Holland Lake Lodge in Montana’s Swan Valley for the first time in two years. 
On Thursday, Jacobsen unlocked the door to the historic lodge — and several nearby cabins and auxiliary buildings — as the new owner of the lodge following a decision by Flathead National Forest officials to grant an operating permit earlier this month. 
The Flathead National Forest issued a 20-year special use authorization and approved a 2025 operating plan for the lodge in early July, allowing Jacobsen and his business partners to run the lodge “within the existing footprint and facilities,” according to the Forest Service. 
“I am looking forward to Holland Lake Lodge beginning to provide a minimal range of recreation services and opportunities for the community in 2025. The lodge has historic value for the forest, the community, and local economy, and has provided visitor access to the surrounding National Forest lands for 100 years,” Forest Supervisor Anthony Botello said in a press release earlier this month. “I am pleased to have reached this milestone with both the new owners and community to continue this opportunity into the future.”
Due to ongoing wastewater treatment system issues at the site, and the approval coming late in the summer season, Jacobsen said the lodge will operate on a minimal level this year. It will likely be open to just a few small private events like weddings or corporate retreats — with plans for a full public-facing season in 2026. 
“It’s been a rough journey for the lodge over the last several years, for me, for the community and for the Forest Service,” Jacobsen told the Daily Montanan in a phone interview while driving back to his Whitefish residence. “It feels pretty amazing to have been able to pull it off and have a permit and now be the next steward of Holland Lake Lodge for the foreseeable future.”

The road for Holland Lake Lodge to change owners has been marred by issues with the Forest Service’s permitting process, possible development plans and public outcry. 
The lodge has operated for a century on the Flathead National Forest with a special-use permit last reissued in 2017.
Christian Wohlfeil owned and operated the lodge for roughly two decades before selling it to Jacobsen. 
In 2022, a proposed expansion of the lodge came to public attention, and included details that Wohlfeil partnered with POWDR, an “adventure life” company in Utah that operates numerous ski resorts around the country. The expansion would have doubled the occupancy of the property and added several new structures, including a new lodge. 
The Forest Service ultimately rejected the expansion proposal, and Wohlfeil listed the lodge for sale in 2023 for $3.5 million, after saying the opposition against him included death threats. 
In 2024, Jacobsen, a private equity investor who splits his time between Park City, Utah, and Whitefish, announced his intention to purchase the lodge. He held several public meetings to engage the local community in his vision — seeking to lower the temperature of the public discourse. 
A recently-formed nonprofit called Stewards of the Swan, headed by Grace Siloti, co-owner of Mission Mountains Mercantile, had also announced an intention to purchase the lodge, and has maintained a strong stance that any new owners should keep the status quo in place for the historic property.  
“For generations, Holland Lake Lodge has served as a gathering place for thousands of Montanans and Americans to enjoy our great public lands. It should remain that way into the future. More than 7,000 Americans told the U.S. Forest Service that they want to keep the lodge the way it is and not expand it to a giant destination resort,” said Grace Siloti, the group’s president, in a statement. “We hope the new owners will manage the lodge consistent with the vision and values expressed by locals and Americans at large. And we’ll ensure that Americans have access to our public lands in the Swan Valley for generations to come.” 
Jacobsen secured the contract to purchase the property last year and subsequently applied for a special-use permit from the Forest Service, which was granted on July 1. 
Under the new special-use authorization granted to Jacobsen, the lodge, cabins and other buildings will offer lodging, food and bar services and non-motorized watercraft rentals. The lodge is expected to be fully operational for a minimum of 153 days during a normal year. 
In 2025, however, the Forest Service approved a limited operating plan due to the time of year and infrastructure improvements that have to be made on site. 
“The lodge hasn’t been open for a while, and when Christian closed it up for the winter, in 2023, he anticipated he would open in 2024, he didn’t so he didn’t close it down the way you would for several years,” Jacobsen said. “There’s definitely some squirrels and mice that have enjoyed having the place to themselves we need to take care of, along with shoring up the rest of the infrastructure.”
Under the terms of the operating agreement, Jacobsen needs to move some fencing and redo signage around the property. 
The wastewater treatment system must be addressed before fully opening to the public — a major remediation. 
The Montana Department of Environmental Quality found the Forest Service was in violation of state law when it was discovered the system which serves the lodge’s septic system, RV dump station and campgrounds near the lake were leaking; and unapproved repairs had been made. 
Problems with the wastewater treatment system were extensive enough to prevent the lodge from operating at all in 2024, which would have been its 100th anniversary year. 
According to the Forest Service, the agency is working with a private engineering firm to determine next steps in the remediation process with no firm timelines. 
Without a wastewater treatment system in place to handle a full suite of visitors, Jacobsen said his hopes for this first year of operation is to be able to host small, private gatherings this fall.
While a full reopening is contingent on fully functioning wastewater system, Jacobsen said the earliest he hopes to welcome guests full time would be the spring of 2026, when it’ll be a return to the “traditional business of nightly rentals and nightly restaurant and bar operations.”
“The wastewater issue just added a level of complexity where I just don’t think we can serve the public in the way we want to this year,” he said. “There is lots of work that needs to be done to get it safe and clean and happy, like it deserves to be when we open.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_5514-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 19:06:08.876659

Gerald Gleeson of Miller Canfield, representing the MEDC in the fight over documents seized by the Michigan Department of Attorney General last month, filed the appeal on Monday afternoon – one business day after Oakland County District Court Judge James Brady’s Friday, June 11 deadline.
The Department of Attorney General executed the search warrant after it claimed in court that MEDC stonewalled an ongoing investigation into Global Link International and its owner, businesswoman Fay Beydoun. No charges have been filed against Beydoun, but it is alleged that Beydoun may have misused funds from a legislative grant issued in 2022. The department of attorney general also raided Beydoun’s residence on June 18, in addition to its search warrant executed on the agency’s offices.
Court documents indicating that the appeal had been filed were provided to Michigan Advance on Monday, but the documents do not include a motion or a brief explaining the MEDC’s arguments as to why the attorney general’s office should not keep the seized documents. 
The agency in court earlier this month told Brady that it believed many of the seized documents were protected under attorney-client privilege and must be returned.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Part of Brady’s original July 10 order denying the MEDC’s motion to quash the search warrant executed on MEDC’s Lansing office was that the attorney general could begin reviewing the documents for privilege through the use of an independent taint team.
Brady gave the MEDC until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, July 11 to determine whether it would file a claim of appeal before the office could commence reviewing three boxes of documents and an MEDC laptop.
In the days leading up to the July 11 deadline, MEDC was silent on whether it would seek an appeal.
The deadline came and went, but the MEDC, through Gleeson, filed a claim of appeal on Monday afternoon. Court documents also show that the appeal was served to the attorney general’s office Monday.
In a statement, Otie McKinley, spokesperson for the MEDC, asserted that the economic development arm of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has been cooperating with Attorney General Dana Nessel and her team as they continue to investigate Global Link.
McKinley also noted that the grant to Global Link – with the amount, the recipient and the disbursement schedule set forth in past budget boilerplate language – was appropriated by the Michigan Legislature and not MEDC alone.
“MEDC strives to administer these pass-through grants in such a way that we can appropriately balance clear legislative intent with stewardship of tax dollars,” McKinley said. “That continues to be our guiding principle.”
On the materials seized, McKinley said the MEDC still holds that Nessel’s office took privileged materials without any allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the agency, and that the office had stated in court that the MEDC was not a suspect or under investigation in the Beydoun matter.
“This sets a dangerous precedent for attorney and client relationships with implications significantly broader than this specific case,” McKinley said. “Even as this appeal moves forward, we continue to cooperate with the Attorney General’s office on their investigation into Global Link.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8781-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 19:06:08.876659

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Two more contenders have entered the race for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, which is expected to be an open race as U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra considers a run for governor.
Kyle Larsen, a farmer and land appraiser, announced he would run as a Republican for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District Monday. He is the latest contender in the primary to succeed Feenstra, joining Iowa House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl, who entered the race last week, and Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan, who announced his campaign in late June.
Larsen said in a campaign launch video he is running on a campaign platform of “faith, family, farm” — the issues he said are most important to voters in the 4th District, the district covering much of northwest Iowa.

“I also do appraise work for farm families all over the great state of Iowa, where I have listened and learned the frustrations farm families are facing every single day,” Larsen said. “I am running for Congress to put an end to the career politicians who are corrupting our politics.”
The Republican is an Iowa State University alumnus who runs a pig and row crop business in Humboldt, where he lives with his wife and two children. He has previously served as president of the Humboldt County Farm Bureau Board.
Larsen said he would want to serve on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee and use his experience as a third-generation farmer to ensure that Iowa farmers’ interests are represented in Washington.
“You will see many candidates come through the door and say they love our farmers, but they can’t come close to understanding the stress every family goes through putting the crop in every year,” Larsen said. “These candidates will never understand how it feels at the end of a rough year or a drought and you’re scrambling to pay your bills and financially prepare for the next season.”
Feenstra had announced an “exploratory” committee for governor after Gov. Kim Reynolds said she will not seek reelection in 2026. Feenstra has represented Iowa’s 4th District since 2021, when he won against incumbent former U.S. Rep. Steve King in the longtime conservative stronghold.
While there are multiple Republicans competing for the seat — which is regularly ranked as a “safe Republican” House race by political forecasters — there was a period when no Democrats were running for the position. Democrat Ryan Melton, who ran against Feenstra in 2022 and 2024, suspended his campaign in June because of issues related to his family and career.
But last week, a new Democratic contender entered the race. Ashley WolfTornabane, a Democrat from Storm Lake, announced her campaign earlier in July. On her page on the donation site ActBlue, WolfTornabane, said if elected, she would work on issues like funding education, advocating for LGBTQ+ individuals and people from other marginalized populations and creating a “feasible pathway to citizenship for our immigrant neighbors.”
WolfTornabane, a stay-at-home mother, also said she supports raising the minimum wage and a “health care for all” system.

Kelly Armstrong presents his proposed budget for the 2025-27 biennium to lawmakers at the Capitol on Jan. 15, 2025. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong expressed concerns Monday that a recent Ethics Commission advisory opinion effectively created a new law without input from the Legislature.
The advisory opinion, requested by Sen. Josh Boschee, D-Fargo, and published in June, spoke to whether it is unethical for a public official or someone running for office to use campaign money to pay for child care or security services.
The commission concluded that using campaign money for those purposes is generally permissible if the need for those services was directly caused by the individual’s candidacy or public service.
Armstrong in public testimony pushed back on these findings.
“Paying for day care or security is a policy question, it’s a political question, and it ends up being a legal interpretation of the Century Code,” he said during the hearing. “It should be subject to hearings, should be subject to debate, and it should be subject eventually, to a vote.”
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen during the meeting invited Armstrong to meet with commissioners at a later date to discuss his concerns in more detail.
The commission is permitted to issue advisory opinions under state law, and has done so since 2022.
Armstrong’s remarks about the June advisory opinion came after his public testimony on the Ethics Commission’s proposed travel disclosure rules. It’s unusual for a governor to testify in person at a public hearing for agency rules. Armstrong was one of two people to testify.
The draft rules would require public officials regulated by the Ethics Commission to report certain details to the state any time they go on a trip paid for by a third party in their capacity as a public servant. The official would have to file information about the purpose and dates of the trip, where they went, how much it cost and where the money came from.
The proposed rules also establish a set of penalties for violators, with the fees for late, incorrect or incomplete filings ranging from $25 to $200. The commission would also be able to hand down a fine for someone who fails to report travel details required by other state agencies, like the Office of Management and Budget.
In the most extreme case, the commission could assess a fee of up to $5,000 for an official found to have knowingly failed to report or to have falsified trip details. The commission would also be able to charge for the cost of investigating and collecting such a fee, the draft rules state.
Armstrong said he was generally supportive of the idea of travel disclosure rules, but asked the commission to ensure that anyone fined for violating the rules has the opportunity to appeal.
“There has to be some due process built into it,” he said.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

The draft rules were partly based on the statute that establishes late filing fees for campaign disclosures to the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office. The proposed rules state that the commission may collect fines through its complaint process, a civil action or by sending the fine to a collection agency. Each of those avenues allow the fined individual to respond.
“The commission is open to continued discussions with the governor to ensure due process is satisfied,” Ethics Commission General Counsel Logan Carpenter said in an email.
Armstrong also had questions about how the rules would apply to a public official who traveled for work but then left their position before reporting the required details about their travel.
“People get on and off boards all the time,” Armstrong said. “Where in that process does jurisdiction begin? Where does it end?”
The Attorney General’s Office in a July 10 letter to the commission objected to the proposed rule on the basis that the commission lacks authority to enact penalties. The Attorney General’s Office previously raised this concern in public comments to lawmakers during the 2025 legislative session.
The Attorney General’s Office wrote that if the commission enacts the penalties, the commission would infringe on the powers of the Legislature and executive branch. The Attorney General’s Office also said that any agency that wants to enact a new fee must seek approval from the Legislature, Budget Section or Emergency Commission.
“The Commission would assume the roles of the legislature, investigator, prosecutor, judge, and jury in each of its cases without the separation of powers mandated by the Constitution,” the agency stated in the July letter. It also argued that the $5,000 fine in the draft rules could be “unconstitutionally excessive.”
The commission has said its ability to enforce ethics laws is implicit in the voter-initiated constitutional amendment that created it.
In the public hearing, Rep. Clayton Fegley, R-Berthold, said the system proposed by the draft rule could be burdensome to state lawmakers.
“I’m an EMT, and I get paid $50 for every time I go on an ambulance run,” he said. “Well, that’s travel — am I going to have to file every time I go on an ambulance run?”
As currently written, the proposed rules would only apply to travel that officials the Ethics Commission regulates make in their capacity as public representatives. They wouldn’t require officials to disclose trips that they take as private citizens.
As of Monday, the only other comment on the proposed rules was submitted by a private citizen over email who said the travel rules were necessary to prevent corruption by public officials. The citizen specifically referenced former Sen. Ray Holmberg of Grand Forks, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison earlier this year on child sex tourism charges. At least some of his travels abroad were subsidized with state money.
Comments on the draft rules may be submitted until July 28. To submit a comment, visit the Ethics Commission’s website.

(Screencap)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha joined 23 states and the District of Columbia Monday in filing suit against President Donald Trump’s administration over $6.8 billion in unexpectedly frozen funds for education initiatives like summer programming and adult learning.
The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Management and Budget and President Donald Trump. The complaint is the first legal response to a June 30 email memo sent from the U.S. Department of Education to education departments nationwide detailing the abrupt suspension of billions in federal education grants. 
A quarter of the grant money typically arrives in state education coffers on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, so local education departments can plan for the year ahead. But the expected payments were paused on June 30, the last day of fiscal year 2025. The maneuver’s timing leaves state-level education officials in precarious positions as they plan for the year ahead, Neronha suggested during a virtual press conference Monday with the Attorneys General of California, Colorado, and Massachusetts, who co-lead the lawsuit.
“It is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year…when the president takes the football away from us like Lucy in a Charlie Brown cartoon,” Neronha said.
The funds supported after-school and summertime programming for kids, as well as adult education, and teacher training. In states like Massachusetts, the grants also subsidized education for children of migrant workers.
Rhode Island would lose an estimated $29 million in federal funds. Across New England, Massachusetts would see a loss of over $100 million, and Connecticut would receive $50 million less. Vermont and Maine would lose $25 million each. New Hampshire, which would also see a $25 million loss of grant funding, is the only New England state not listed as a plaintiff in the suit.
R.I. leaders are planning their next move after feds withhold $30M in K-12 funding

The grants now depend on a review meant to ascertain whether “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” according to the three-sentence email from the education department sentJune 30. 
The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A July 9 statement Office of Management and Budget  shared with Rhode Island Current noted that the funds were paused after some school districts had allegedly used previous grant money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.”
The attorneys general argue that the funding freeze violates an assortment of federal laws and constitutional principles — both recurring themes in the arguments they made in dozens of similar multi-state lawsuits brought to court since Trump took office in January.  
California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who hosted the press conference, described the lawsuit as the latest defensive move against what he called the Trump administration’s “little regard for the law.” 
“In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks, eight of them challenge unlawful attacks on education,” Bonta said.
The coalition of attorneys general wants a federal judge to rule that the funding freeze is illegal, as well as order the federal government to release the money. A pair of court filings seeking both outcomes comprises over 180 pages, and describe the freeze as “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional.”  
Neronha told reporters that, in Rhode Island’s case, the funding freeze comes at an especially inopportune time, with the state’s part-time legislature having just wrapped up its legislative session three weeks prior. 
“It was a very difficult budget year,” Neronha said, with lawmakers forced to make tough fiscal decisions amid the state’s many money troubles, including an ailing health care infrastructure. 
But the AG said he hoped that the issue would be resolved “far, far, far before” legislators return for a new legislative session in January. 
Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green previously denounced the funding freeze at a July 9 press conference. In a Monday statement, Infante-Green again decried the funding stoppage as one that “harms Rhode Island’s students, families, and teachers.” The $29 million loss of Congressionally approved aid means “there will be cuts” to before- and after-school programs, STEM learning, multilingual education, and professional development for teachers, Infante-Green said. 
“Rhode Island students have been making significant strides in education progress, post-pandemic,” Infante-Green wrote in her statement. “Delays and cuts in federal funds put progress and momentum in every district in Rhode Island at risk. RIDE is working closely with education leaders across the state, and across the country, doing everything we can to protect our students and limit disruptions to their learning.“ 
Taking legal action against the Trump administration is now routine for Neronha’s office. His office’s  website has tallied its salvoes against the Trump administration since March 13. Thus far, Neronha has co-led or joined 26 lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Asked by reporters about the likelihood of success in the present funding case, Neronha declined to predict an outcome.
“I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves and I don’t obviously want to speak for the court,” he said. “We have to make our points there as well. But based on the track record…we’ve seen this story before. We’ve been in the ring before with these sorts of cases and we’ve had great success because the violations of the law are so obvious.”

Mike Kehoe signs his first executive orders following his inauguration ceremony in January.(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed a bill Monday that would establish a fund to pay for hyperbaric oxygen therapy for veterans with a traumatic brain injury and facing post-traumatic stress disorder to help prevent suicide and opioid addiction.
This spring, the legislation received overwhelming support from state lawmakers, passing with a 33-0 vote in the Missouri Senate and a 156-1 vote in the House.
“The bottom line is, there are too many veterans that are taking their lives,”  said state Rep. Chris Brown, a Republican from Kansas City sponsoring the legislation, during debate. “They don’t see a way out. They can’t deal with it. And I think the oxygen therapy certainly will help and maybe even is the answer.”
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, sponsored a companion bill in the Senate.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the goal of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is to get more oxygen to tissues damaged by disease, injury or other factors. Patients enter a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, where the air pressure is increased up to three times higher than normal air pressure. The lungs can gather much more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.
The bill directs the Missouri Veterans Commission to compile an annual report with data about the treatment of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and its effectiveness.
Dale Lutzen, a retired senior master sergeant from the U.S. Air Force and a legislative advocate for the non-profit TreatNOW, said he’s been pushing for the last four years to get the fund established.
Lutzen told lawmakers in a committee hearing in January that veterans with traumatic brain injuries or PTSD are typically given prescription drugs that treat symptoms but don’t cure the brain injury.
“As an alternative to drugs, hyperbaric oxygen therapy stimulates brain wound healing and it can reverse soft tissue and neurocognitive damage,” Lutzen said during a hearing. “This treatment allows patients to experience recovery of cognitive and neurological functioning without surgery or drugs.”
Despite numerous studies that prove its efficacy, the treatment is not on Medicare’s approved list, he said, and is not covered. 
“At its most basic level, HB262 gives veterans, who have been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury or PTSD, the right to receive the treatment as prescribed by a doctor,” he said.
Last year, the bill passed in the House but stalled in the Senate.
According to the bill’s fiscal analysis, the cost of reimbursing hyperbaric facilities for the necessary treatments could exceed $5 million annually. The funds will come from “any appropriations, gifts, bequests, or public or private donations,” the bill states.
State Rep. Stephanie Boykin, a Democrat from Florissant and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, spoke in support of the bill on Monday. 
“We have veterans who are suffering,” Boykin said. “We have veterans who have already tried medicines. They’ve already tried just traditional therapy. So this alternative therapy is what’s needed, and we need to be there and stand for our veterans.”

Article Summary

Former Commonwealth Edison executive John Hooker has been sentenced to 18 months in prison in addition to a $500,000 fine — the first of the “ComEd Four” to face sentencing after their 2023 convictions.
A jury found Hooker and his co-defendants guilty of bribing ex-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan with jobs and contracts for his political allies at the electric utility while the company was pushing for legislation in Springfield.
Hooker’s co-defendants are to be sentenced later in separate hearings.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


CHICAGO — A former executive for electric utility Commonwealth Edison has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in bribing ex-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan for jobs and contracts for the Democratic power broker’s political allies.

John Hooker, a career employee at ComEd who worked his way up from the mail room to a job as the utility’s top internal lobbyist, is the first of the “ComEd Four” to face sentencing; his co-defendants are scheduled for their own hearings in the coming weeks.

In sentencing Hooker on Monday, U.S. District Judge Manish Shah zoomed out from the specific actions that led to across-the-board guilty verdicts for the ComEd Four, convicted in 2023 for orchestrating a yearslong bribery scheme targeted at Madigan to grease the wheels for major legislation the utility was pushing in Springfield.

“Corruption fuels a power that is wielded not for representative democracy by the will of the people, but things like oligarchy, autocracy, even kleptocracy, all while keeping up appearance of democracy,” Shah said. “To do business with corrupt power encourages it, and that’s what you did here.”

Sentencings for Hooker and his co-defendants were put on hold for more than two years, delayed by concerns of possible impact from a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the death of the original judge who oversaw their case, and Madigan’s own lengthy trial.

The jury in the former speaker’s trial ended with a split verdict in February, including acquittals and deadlock on more than half of the charges — including bribery — both related to ComEd and entirely separate from the utility. But jurors returned guilty verdicts on each of the four counts involving Madigan’s own role in pushing for a handful of allies to get what were ultimately do-nothing contracts amounting to $1.3 million paid out from ComEd over eight years.

In wiretapped phone calls played both at trials for Madigan and the ComEd Four, Hooker and his co-defendant, longtime ComEd lobbyist Mike McClain, talked about having come up with the arrangement to conceal the no-work contractors within existing legitimate lobbying contracts.

In a February 2019 recording, McClain said the utility “had to hire these guys because Mike Madigan came to us,” and Hooker agreed, saying their use of ComEd lobbyist Jay Doherty as a pass-through entity was “clean for all of us.”

“We don’t have to worry about whether or not, I’m just making this up, whether or not Mike Zalewski Sr., is doing any work or not,” McClain told Hooker in the phone call, referring to the former Chicago alderman who’d been put on Doherty’s contract the previous summer. “That’s up to Jay Doherty to prove that.”

Hooker concurred.

“We came up with this plan and between him (Doherty), our friend, and Tim (Mapes) and the alderman, they thought it was great,” Hooker said, using “our friend” to mean Madigan, as established across both trials, and referring to the speaker’s former chief of staff Tim Mapes.

More than six years after the FBI recorded that call, Hooker on Monday told Shah that “listening to himself” on those wiretapped calls was “a very humbling experience.”

“I do not like the way I sound on those recordings,” Hooker said. “I’m just deeply sorry after listening to those recordings of myself. ... I pray that I’m not defined by these words and this case for the rest of the years that I have left on this earth.”

Reiterating prosecutors’ request for 56 months in prison, Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia Schwartz on Monday cited more secret recordings of Hooker, which she said “shows this defendant knew full well these payments going to subcontractors … were paid for the purpose of buying legislation.”

In one February 2019 video surreptitiously recorded by ComEd exec-turned-FBI mole Fidel Marquez, Hooker imagined how Madigan might react if the utility could no longer pay the subcontractors through intermediaries.

""‘You're not going to do something for me, I don't have to do anything for you,’"" Hooker said, speculating on the speaker’s thought process, adding that Madigan would never say it outright.

But Hooker attorney Jacqueline Jacobson emphasized that her client didn’t personally benefit from the bribery scheme and said “John believed in what he was doing” when it came to the legislation he was pushing for on behalf of ComEd.

“This is not a typical bribery case,” Jacobson said. “This is not cash in a bag. This is not benefiting someone in a way that is evil. This is for legislation.”

Before Shah handed down the 1 ½-year sentence — along with a $500,000 fine — the judge ruled Hooker lied on the witness stand when he testified in his own defense during trial. He also rebuked Hooker for his role in Illinois' long history of corruption.

“It takes courage to speak up, to say no to the face of power, like Mr. Madigan,” Shah said. “It’s easy to say yes when you have the talent and the wherewithal to play within the corrupt system. ... Lobbyists, corporate execs, public officials — whether in Springfield, Chicago or Washington, D.C. — should be reminded that there are still crimes on the books.”

Hooker sat stoically at the defense table when Shah delivered his verdict as dozens of family members and friends watched from the courtroom gallery, some reacting with silent tears. Later, Hooker exited the Dirksen Federal Courthouse flanked by his attorneys, making no comment to reporters.

He is scheduled to report to prison on Oct. 14.

Farmers had fewer than four days suitable for field work during the reporting period due to what State Climatologist Justin Glisan referred to as an “anomalously wet and active” weather week. 
On average, the state received 2.37 inches of precipitation during the period, which is more than an inch above the normal. Precipitation accumulation maps for the period show a band of heavy rain from river to river across the central portion of the state. These areas received 2-4 inches more than the normal for the reporting period. 
Asbury in Dubuque County clocked the most precipitation for the period with 6.77 inches. Several towns in eastern Iowa had flash flooding warnings and there were tornadoes in Canton, Clarinda and in Scott County. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation Monday for Scott County, due to damages from the storm. The disaster proclamation opens up state funds to help with repairs to an area and allows affected residents to apply for grants to help pay for repairs and other expenses caused by the storm.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said it was a “wild weather week” for the state. 
“Though the rainfall is improving drought conditions and helping the corn during tasseling and pollination, there are now parts of the state that could use a break from the rain,” Naig said in a statement. 
According to the report, north central Iowa has the wettest soil, with 37% of topsoil and 38% of subsoil moisture conditions rated as surplus for the period. On average, topsoil moisture conditions for the state rated 71% adequate and 23% surplus. Subsoil moisture conditions for the state were 74% adequate and 16% surplus. 
South western Iowa continued to have the driest soil conditions as 31% of topsoil and 35% of subsoil rated short.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
Elon Musk fumes tax and spending bill is a ‘disgusting abomination’; GOP senators shrug

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.


The Cook Report includes New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District, currently represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez as one of its Democratic toss-up races.
Political parties in New Mexico are required to adopt rules providing for the organization and government of that party, which they file with the Secretary of State. They must also file hand-printed names, signatures, addresses of registration and counties of residence of at least one-half of one percent of the total votes cast for the office of governor at the preceding general election, which at present would be 3,561 signatures. Currently, both the Green Party and Libertarian Party have minor party status in the state. The Democratic and Republican parties have major party status.


Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

The intent was to compare the effects of the newly enacted federal cuts with the potential economic gains Wyoming could enjoy under a different scenario: Medicaid expansion. 
The Health Trust released the study on the heels of the bill’s narrow passage into law — which makes the prognostications related to cuts even more relevant.
“The impacts here start in the health care sector, but they really spread throughout the entire economy, in terms of across different industries,” said study author Dr. Peter Evangelakis, senior vice president of economics and consulting at REMI. 
Those impacts include an estimated loss of 192 jobs per year — with just over half of those in health care, followed by construction, retail and government. The state’s gross domestic product will shrink by $27.8 million per year, the report finds, and residents will have $14.6 million less annually in disposable personal income. The hardest-hit regions will be the ones home to Wyoming’s two largest towns: Casper and Cheyenne.

The study offers a look into the broader economic consequences of a policy many advocates say will have detrimental impacts on Wyoming’s health care landscape. At least 12,000 Wyoming residents are projected to lose health coverage under the law, health-care advocates say.
Evidence-based resource
Natrona Collective Health Trust commissioned the study after seeing a similar analysis performed on the state of North Carolina, Rachel Bouzis, director of policy and learning at the organization, said in an online press conference Friday.
“After that report was released in 2019, policy leaders, businesses and communities used that data to inform decisions that ultimately improved both health and local economies,” Bouzis said. 
The trust wanted a similar resource for Wyoming, she said. Along with the Wyoming Community Foundation, Wyoming Hospital Association, Banner Wyoming Medical Center and American Cancer Society, it commissioned the study — which is the first to evaluate the economic impacts of Medicaid policy in Wyoming, Bouzis said. 
For the study, consultant REMI compared the effects of cuts — which were still just a possibility at the time of analysis — with the potential economic gains Wyoming could see under Medicaid expansion. 
The two scenarios correspond with two significant pieces of national legislation. 
The Big Beautiful Bill is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Changes include increased work requirements and potential penalties for states that have expanded Medicaid.
The Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare, allowed states to expand Medicaid to cover more residents. Some 41 states, including Washington, D.C., have expanded. Wyoming is among the 10 that have not. 
Where the cuts will lead to a shrinking state economy, the study found, expanding Medicaid in Wyoming would do the reverse. Expanding enrollment could lead to 440 new jobs over five years and a $60.9 million yearly increase in GDP, the study found. That includes a $41.5 million increase in disposable personal income per year, which breaks down to about $160 per family. 
“This report confirms what many experts in health care and economic policy have long understood: Medicaid is not just a health program — it has a direct economic impact on Wyoming’s communities,” Natrona Collective Health Trust CEO Beth Worthen said in a release.

The net five-year difference between Medicaid cuts and expansion is a loss of 3,160 jobs, $444 million in GDP and $260.5 million in personal income, the study finds. 
“So we do see overall, a kind of a lost opportunity, given the negative impact of cuts, and even stronger positive impacts of what an expansion could have brought,” Evangelakis said.
REMI honed in on the time window from 2026-2030 for the assessment. Medicaid cuts are set to be phased in over several years, according to news outlets.

When REMI began the study, Evangelakis said, his team attempted to base estimates of cuts on the most severe reductions that could result from what then was draft legislation. 
“We thought that our estimate would be the worst case,” he said. “It actually turned out that the cuts [in the Big Beautiful Bill] were a little bit bigger. But this should still give us a good sense of what the impacts will be.”
For the cuts, he said, the direct economic impact will be a loss in revenue for health care providers — everything from outpatient providers like dentists to rural hospitals and retail pharmacies. The largest impacts of the cuts would take place in the state’s “metro areas” that include Cheyenne and Casper.
“But there are significant impacts across the state,” Evangelakis said. 
The study bolsters arguments of health-care advocates that the federal legislation will harm Wyoming’s rural hospitals and lead to less access to health care here.

Still, the Health Trust and its other partners had no agenda in mind when they commissioned the study, Bouzis said. 
“This report is not in any way prescriptive,” she said. “We are just providing information from expert sources.” Then it’s up to the communities, policymakers and business owners to decide what to do next, she added.
Wyoming’s congressional delegation, Republican Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso and Rep. Harriet Hageman, voted in support of the bill. 
“In Wyoming people are thrilled @potus singed [sic] the One Big Beautiful Bill into law,” Barrasso, a physician, posted Thursday on X. “It’s going to fulfill our promise to make America safe and prosperous again. America is getting back on track.”
Defending the bill during a weekend appearance on NBC News, Barrasso said Medicaid had become a magnet for waste, fraud, abuse and corruption.

Pam Evette speaks at a town hall event in Columbia, June 25, 2025. Evette held similar events across South Carolina as she was weighing a bid for governor. (Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)GREENVILLE — Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette on Monday officially launched her bid to be South Carolina’s next governor, becoming the third candidate to jump into the crowded primary to replace her boss.
The first candidates to announce their bids last month were Attorney General Alan Wilson and Sen. Josh Kimbrell, a Spartanburg County Republican.
Filing for the June GOP primary is still eight months away.
Evette, speaking at a Greenville event space Monday night, emphasized her experience serving alongside Gov. Henry McMaster since he was first elected for a full term in 2018. Although the role is part-time, Evette has supported McMaster’s positions, including a ban on transgender athletes, which he signed in 2022, and support for the state’s law enforcement officers, she said.
“Together, we have delivered conservative successes, not excuses,” Evette told a crowd of several hundred people. “And we’ve never settled. We’ve continued to move the needle and have kept South Carolina winning and growing year after year.”

Evette also aligned herself with President Donald Trump. Like McMaster, Evette supported Trump from the get-go, she said, including when he announced his run for a second term in 2024.
“And now, with President Trump back in the White House, South Carolina needs a governor who has earned his trust,” Evette said during her half-hour speech. “A governor who doesn’t need to build a relationship. A governor who can pick up the phone and get things done for South Carolina because that relationship already exists.”
A campaign video released on social media Monday shows a montage of McMaster and Trump praising Evette, concluding with “to be continued… 2026.”
“Let’s stand up and Keep South Carolina Great!” reads her message that tops the video.
That message continued at her announcement, as people waved signs that read “Keep South Carolina Great!” and “Pamela Evette for Governor.” Several GOP legislative leaders from the Upstate attended, including House Majority Leader Davey Hiott of Pickens, and Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister of Greenville.

Evette likened her business experience and unconventional path to politics to Trump’s, pointing to her own background as founder of payroll and human resources firm Quality Business Solutions.
The 2026 race to be South Carolina’s CEO is the first solo run for elected office for the trained accountant and mother of three.
Evette joined McMaster’s team as his running mate in November 2017, a year ahead of the first election in South Carolina with candidates for governor and lieutenant governor on the same ticket.
“You see, I’m not a career politician who needs time to figure things out,” Evette said. “I’m a conservative businesswoman who built a successful, national company right here in South Carolina.”
The governor has limited power in South Carolina, though the office does provide a bully pulpit to advocate for and against legislation. McMaster has gotten more of his recommendations passed, compared to his predecessors, largely because he’s worked with GOP leaders ahead of making announcements.
All of the GOP candidates so far, including Evette, have highlighted their intent to eliminate the state income tax, though that is not something the governor can do unilaterally.
In 2022, ahead of the last gubernatorial election, McMaster signed a law cutting state income taxes by more than $1 billion over an expected five years. This year’s state budget completed that phase-in period early.
Legislation passed by the House in late April calls for eventually eliminating the tax, which still makes up about 45% of state general fund revenues, at $6.5 billion. It’s unclear what the Senate will do with that proposal next year.
Evette contends the state can make up that loss in state revenue by mimicking Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency in South Carolina to cut spending. The office would also examine “useless and outdated regulations,” she said.
“For every new regulation proposed, we will get rid of 10,” Evette said.
She would continue to support Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts, she said. Although South Carolina is not a border state, more law enforcement agencies have been signing agreements with the federal government to help deport immigrants without legal documentation.
“We must continue to empower our South Carolina law enforcement to keep dangerous illegals off our streets and away from our children,” Evette said.
Evette said she would also push for universal school choice, the term for making all K-12 students eligible for private tuition aid. That would further expand on a state law signed by McMaster in May.
She also wants to continue McMaster’s push for changes in how the Legislature selects judges — as does Wilson. McMaster called a law he signed last year an improvement, but only a start. The Legislature didn’t touch that issue this year.
Evette highlighted consistency as a strong point for her candidacy. Voters “won’t wonder what you’re getting” in voting for her, Evette said.
“You won’t hope I’ll be conservative enough,” Evette said. “You won’t pray I’ll stand with President Trump. Because my record is clear.”
At least three other Republicans have suggested they could enter the race.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, who represents the coastal 1st District, has been hinting at a run for governor for months, taking jabs at Wilson and Evette on social media and during stops in South Carolina. She has repeatedly called Evette a “nice woman,” including in a post ahead of Evette’s announcement Monday, while adding that she doesn’t think being nice will be enough to run the state.
U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman has said he’ll make an announcement later this month. State Sen. Sean Bennett, R-Summerville, has said he’s considering entering the race but will wait to survey the field before jumping in.
On the Democratic side, Rep. Jermaine Johnson, D-Columbia, said he is considering running.
The last time a Democrat won an elected statewide office was in 2006, for state superintendent of education, and the last Democratic governor, Jim Hodges, finished his term in 2003. All statewide offices, six of seven U.S. House seats and a supermajority of both chambers are held by Republicans.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0940-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 19:06:08.876659

Chris Brown, a Kansas City Republican, speaks in the House in February (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Local laws prohibiting landlords from discriminating against tenants who receive public assistance are unenforceable under legislation signed Monday by Gov. Mike Kehoe. 
The legislation takes aim at ordinances passed in several Missouri cities to protect tenants from discrimination based on the source of their income — especially tenants who use federal housing choice vouchers, known as Section 8 vouchers, to pay rent.
The bill was co-sponsored by state Reps. Chris Brown, a Republican from Kansas City, and Ben Keathley, a Republican from Chesterfield. In the Senate, it was carried by state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance. 
Kansas City passed a source of income discrimination ban last year, though it was in large part paused by the courts in February.
Columbia, St. Louis, Webster Groves and Clayton have similar protections on the books. The laws make it illegal for landlords to discriminate based solely on the fact of renters’ lawful sources of income, including Section 8, veterans’ benefits and Social Security.
The legislation had the support of landlords groups, apartment associations, the realtors’ association and the conservative think tank Show Me Institute. Proponents characterized localities’ source-of-income protections as an overreach into property owners’ rights.
Opponents said the bill infringed on local control and would hurt affordable housing availability, exacerbating homelessness. The city of Kansas City has been opposed along with the anti-poverty nonprofit Empower Missouri and an association of public housing authorities in Missouri.

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on Friday (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).A Missouri bill closing records with personal information about young people and state court personnel includes provisions that could help governments hide records intended to be public, open government advocates said Monday.
Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the bill Monday, along with 11 other measures, as he finished work on legislation passed this year by state lawmakers. He signed all 48 statutory bills presented to him, using his veto only to reduce or eliminate individual line items in the state budget.
Lawmakers will consider whether to override the budget cuts when they meet Sept. 10 in the annual veto session.
The other bills signed Monday include legislation that would provide new support for the Missouri Sheriffs Retirement Fund, allow organizations like the Missouri Farm Bureau to offer health plans that are exempt from federal rules, and limit any attempt to tap Missouri’s water resources for export to dry states.
“Agriculture and rural communities are the backbone of Missouri,” Kehoe said in a news release after signing the bills. “By expanding health care access and protecting our water resources for future generations, these bills ensure that the families who feed, fuel, and clothe this state have the support they need to keep doing what they do best.”
The other bills remaining on his desk represent “common-sense legislation…that will positively impact Missouri families and communities,” Kehoe said.
The bill closing records containing personal information applies to material about persons age 17 or under, court personnel including circuit clerks and prosecutors, their staff and court administrative personnel.
The provision causing concern, however, is a change in how the public pays fees for open records requests, and how long those requests can remain pending, under the Sunshine Law.
Currently, government agencies can require that fees for copying records must be paid before copies are delivered. Under the bill signed by Kehoe, government agencies may require that all fees, for searching, retrieving and copying records, be paid before the request is fulfilled.
The bill would also cancel records requests when required fees are not paid within 90 days, with an allowance of 150 days for requests where fees exceed $1,000.
The change may be insignificant or it may create a new barrier to obtaining records, said David Roland, director of the Freedom Center of Missouri.
Government agencies are allowed to charge fees to search for, retrieve and copy records to fulfill requests under the Sunshine Law. The search and retrieval is supposed to be charged as an hourly rate equal to the lowest-paid personnel capable of doing the work, with copying fees limited to no more than 10 cents per paper page for physical records or the cost of electronic media for records delivered digitally.
Inflated fees are the equivalent of a denial, a Boone County judge ruled in 2019 when the University of Missouri demanded more than $82,000 for records about dogs used in research. And the fees cannot include attorney time required to separate open from closed portions, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled in 2021.
Missouri Supreme Court: State can’t charge attorney fees for Sunshine Law requests

The new language could result in inflated fee demands that must be paid before an agency even begins searching for responsive records, Roland said.
“This fee shenanigan is the latest front line in government entities that don’t want to produce records,” Roland said.
A person requesting records can ask for a detailed statement of fees and change the request to lower the cost, but it is difficult to challenge the estimate as a whole, he said.
“There is no real way for the citizen to contest the amount if the government says that is what it is going to take,” Roland said.
The legislation, as a whole, is another attempt to limit the public’s access to government records, said Echo Menges, president of the Missouri Sunshine Coalition.
She said she hadn’t seen a full analysis of the bill yet.
“I hesitate on anything that limits the Sunshine Law in any way,” she said. “The Sunshine Law ought to be gaining ground, not losing ground.”
She questions the need to limit public access to records about court personnel or juveniles.
“Are there real life situations,” Menges said, “or is this just more of what we have seen in the past, which is making up stuff that has never happened to push back on people’s right to know.”
 Sheriffs retirement

Over the past two years, Missouri lawmakers have spent $12 million of state general revenue to shore up the finances of the Missouri Sheriffs Retirement System, which provides pensions to former elected sheriffs.
The funding — $10 million last year and $2 million this year — was needed to replace money from a court fee on criminal cases found unconstitutional by the Missouri Supreme Court as a barrier to citizens to access the courts.
Missouri voters reject funding sheriff and prosecutor pensions through court fees

Lawmakers tried to reinstate the fee but voters rejected that proposal by a 61% majority in November.
The bill signed by Kehoe would increase the fee for sheriffs to serve papers in a civil case and dedicate $1.75 off the daily amount the state pays for housing prisoners convicted of felonies and sentenced to a term in a state prison. The state pays counties $24.95 a day.
Sheriffs, who are paid from $70,300 to $174,116 annually, depending on their counties, contribute 5% of their pay to the fund.
State Sen. Rusty Black, a Chillicothe Republican who handled the bill in the upper chamber, said during debate that the bill will make the system stable for at least 20 years.
 Farm Bureau health plans

After three years of trying, backers of the Missouri Farm Bureau pushed through a bill allowing it to offer health plans that don’t abide by the protections set by the Affordable Care Act. As a result, the Farm Bureau would be able to offer lower-price coverage options, which the organization and its supporters say is necessary to help uninsured farmers.
Kehoe visited the Farm Bureau headquarters in Jefferson City to sign the bill.
Opponents added provisions mandating a clear disclaimer that the coverage is not officially regulated as health insurance, mandating the company can’t cancel coverage for members because of a medical event and ensuring the state insurance department will handle complaints. 
The bill contains a wide swath of other health measures, including several added by Democrats during negotiations.
Those include: provisions mandating that Missouri Medicaid cover hearing aids and cochlear implants for adults, expanding access to testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, requiring insurance companies that provide birth control medication to provide extended supplies and tweaking the law around telehealth to allow audio-only visits.

 Water exports

On Monday afternoon, water in the Missouri River at Boonville was flowing at a rate of 62,600 feet per second, enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in a little over one second.
Across the country, at the Colorado-Utah border, the Colorado River was running at about 2,700 feet per second. Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the two largest water reservoirs in the United States, have both fallen this year as a scanty snowpack aggravated water woes in the West.
Under legislation Kehoe signed Monday, that Missouri River water — and every other source of water — would be off-limits to most large-scale uses outside the state. Water exports would require a permit and no large-scale water exports would be allowed outside of a region within 30 miles of the state’s borders.
Water bottled for human consumption would be exempt from the requirement.
Water-scarce states “are turning a thirsty eye to Missouri and other Midwestern states that are water rich in order to get some of that water and move it,” state Rep. Colin Wellenkamp, a Republican from St. Charles, said during House debate in May. “That is a very real threat that this bill attempts to mitigate.”

 With some children staying at Red Clover Treatment Center for a month or more, advocates fear the temporary facility intended for short-term use isn’t so short term. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont keeps youth for weeks at a temporary locked facility that ‘just isn’t built’ for long-term stays.","Described by advocates for youth as two trailers plopped in a parking lot, the Red Clover Treatment Center is Vermont’s temporary — and only — locked juvenile facility. 
The secure program, opened in October 2024, was meant to meet an immediate need, providing a crisis-ready option for children in the juvenile justice system requiring short-term care. 
The temporary facility in Middlesex bought the state time to build a permanent, secure complex in Vergennes. But now, plans for that project are up in the air, and officials are grappling with the limitations of Red Clover given that the program may operate longer than intended. 
Vermont’s scarce options for secure placement of youth are having immediate effects. Just last week, a 14-year-old boy was held at Marble Valley Correctional Facility in Rutland — an adult jail. The boy was charged as an adult with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was later transferred to Red Clover, according to court documents.  
Advocates for youth and Vermont Department for Children and Families officials agree that Red Clover’s operator — the for-profit contractor Sentinel Group — is making the most of an imperfect space. They agree the facility functions well when children are held there short term. 
However, that doesn’t mean juveniles are receiving ideal care, and the experiences of youth reveal the constraints of Red Clover’s stopgap nature.
The state is often holding juveniles at the Middlesex facility for a month or more. Providing an education in such a restrictive setting can pose a challenge, and without a complete kitchen, the facility often relies on takeout — including fast food —  to feed residents.  
“In our opinion, Red Clover is suitable as a short-term facility. It’s not suitable as a long-term facility,” said Marshall Pahl, Vermont’s deputy defender general. “No matter what kind of programming they put in place, even if they had great meals there, it would not be a suitable long-term facility. It just isn’t built that way.”

A temporary building for short-term stays
Since the closure of Woodside Juvenile Rehabilitation Center in 2020, Vermont has been without a permanent, secure facility for youth where residents are locked in and closely guarded. 
To fill the niche, the Department for Children and Families proposed the Green Mountain Youth Campus. The 14-bed concept, originally slated to open in 2026, would be half the size of Woodside, serving children in a space designed to be therapeutic, not punitive. 
But the state pulled back its plan to build the permanent facility in Vergennes last month, running into local opposition and zoning obstacles. Though department officials assert the state still intends to construct the facility, they have not chosen a specific site. 
In the meantime, Vermont has Red Clover. The Middlesex program, itself a repurposed psychiatric facility formerly run by the Vermont Department of Mental Health, is intended to stabilize children in crisis through short-term stays. That means holding youth charged with or found guilty of violent offenses, many of whom may also be in mental health distress. The facility is designed for ages 13 through 17, although teens up to the age of 19 can be sent there in certain circumstances, according to the state’s contract with Sentinel.

On average, the state has held teens there for 34 days, according to Aryka Radke, deputy commissioner of the department’s family services division. Eighteen children have been held in the facility at various times since it opened in the fall. 
“The facility itself lacks the size, expansion potential, and projected lifespan to meet the full needs of the state,” Radke said in an email. Otherwise, she said she’s confident in the quality of service the department has provided so far. 
According to Tyler Allen, the department’s high-end system of care director, youth held at Red Clover for extended periods of time fall into two broad categories: Vermonters whom the state cannot find a bed for at a different program and juveniles from out-of-state with court proceedings in Vermont. 
Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Vermont has lost about half of its youth residential treatment beds, Allen said. The decrease, driven by programs’ staffing shortages, has caused statewide capacity to slip from roughly 200 to 100, he said. 
In the web of residential placements, Red Clover is the only program required to accept any youth, space permitting, regardless of their legal record. 
Sometimes, another program might reject a youth because of their past behavior, according to Allen. And sometimes there just isn’t another place to put a child, he said, which has resulted in Red Clover’s longest stays. The department did not answer a request to provide data on the longest it has held a child at Red Clover. 
Out-of-state youth have also wound up with extended stays at Red Clover, in part due to the separate regulations governing them. The Interstate Compact on Juveniles outlines how states interact with each other when dealing with children in custody.
If a child from elsewhere is charged with an offense in Vermont — in family court or criminal court — the youth generally must remain in Vermont until their case is resolved. 
Adult criminal court proceedings for juveniles can be especially complex because they typically involve a serious offense, drawing out a youth’s time in Vermont’s custody. 
So far, four of the 18 children held at Red Clover have been housed through the interstate compact before being transferred to their home states, according to Radke. Most of those youth have been held for around 50 days, she said. 
To Vermont’s top juvenile public defender Pahl, much about Red Clover only causes concern if youth are held there for weeks and months rather than days. He praised Red Clover’s operators for making the most of the space and noted they offer youth more freedoms, such as extensive time outdoors, than other programs. 
However, the physical space poses limitations. A therapeutic program starts with designated treatment space — something Red Clover clearly lacks, Pahl said. 
“I mean, it’s literally sort of two trailers joined together in an L-shape with a courtyard between them,” he said. “They’re doing the best with what they got, but it ain’t a good space.”
Vermont’s children would benefit from more intermediate placement options in less restrictive environments, Pahl argued, and the state should focus on expanding access not just to the most secure youth treatment programs. 
Otherwise, Pahl fears youth will face the same issues they experienced at Woodside — like physical abuse, neglect and retaliation. 
“We will see those same kinds of problems again if youth wind up at Red Clover for way too long,” he said.

Takeout and fast-food
Red Clover’s licensing agreement grants the program special permission to bring in food from off site, including takeout. 
The kitchen has limitations, such as lacking ventilation for its stove, which prevents staff from cooking meat, according to the Department for Children and Families. Equipped with an oven, range and microwave, facility staff prepare cold foods and warm up precooked meals. 
The inability to prepare whole-cooked meals has worried advocates.
Patrick Warn has served for more than eight years as a guardian ad litem — a volunteer who advocates for youth in court. He’s worked with two kids placed at Red Clover. 
“Basically, their dinner is they literally run out to McDonalds or Burger King or whatever,” Warn said. 
He acknowledged that giving youth the ability to choose their meals — including fast food — can be a tool to reward or incentivize good behavior but said it should not be an everyday practice. Pahl thinks similarly. 
“Is serving kids McDonald’s at a placement a problem? Maybe it wouldn’t be if it was actually a short-term placement, if kids were only at a placement for a day or two or three,” he said. “But it’s not just a food problem. It’s a problem because that place was never meant to be a long-term placement. It wasn’t built for that. It’s still not built for that.”
Allen, the department official who oversees Red Clover, rejected the idea that the program serves takeout daily. Instead, he said the program’s staff try to find creative ways to expand dining choices for youth. That includes offering food from local restaurants, such as Thai, Chinese and more-upscale establishments, noting that fast food is one of the less frequented options.  
He acknowledged that the program serves takeout “more often than your average family.” While he did not know the exact frequency, Allen estimated Red Clover serves takeout “probably three to four nights per week,” which he described in positive terms. 
“Having some choice in meals is, I think, one of the things that we’ve appreciated about the program,” Allen said. “They’re willing to make that investment of time and energy to tailor it to kids.
Pahl and Warn also identified similar concerns with the education youth receive. 
“Courts have always held that kids are entitled to their education, whether they are in DCF custody (or) incarcerated,” Pahl said. “My understanding from our clients is that they are getting some educational services. Is it as good as we could have if we had a more permanent, better-staffed, well-structured program in place? Definitely not.”
Warn, who’s worked with kids held at placements across the state and country, said programs often struggle to provide an education when they are not attached to an actual school. To him, Red Clover is no different. 
He compared the schooling to when a substitute teaches a class — an interruption to the educational flow. 
In contrast, Allen described Red Clover’s educational tutoring as adaptable and a stabilizing factor for youth entering the program, some of whom weren’t regularly attending school beforehand.

Public versus private accountability
When Vermont closed Woodside in 2020, state officials declared it the end of an era. Since then, Department for Children and Families leaders have said the state should no longer both run and oversee a facility themselves. 
Instead, they would turn to private contractors to run secure programs in the future. That way, the state could serve as the watchdog, ensuring accountability, officials said. 
As Allen described it, the Woodside model involved a conflict of interest. 
“That inherent conflict creates a gap that can limit the power of your regulatory intervention,” he said.
But advocates for youth in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems have argued the opposite. They are skeptical that privatization will bring increased accountability. 
The state tapped the for-profit company Sentinel Group to run Red Clover and help create the still-to-come Green Mountain Youth Campus. The company’s owner operates other youth facilities around New England, including the Vermont School for Girls in Bennington and Mount Prospect Academy in New Hampshire. 
At the Bennington school, some staff have faced criminal sexual abuse charges. As recently as March, an employee was charged with repeatedly sexually assaulting a student. In New Hampshire, Mount Prospect Academy faces more than 100 lawsuits by current and former students alleging, among other claims, physical and sexual abuse, Seven Days reported 
Vermont pays Sentinel about $343,500 a month to run Red Clover, according to the state’s contract. 
Some advocates for juveniles think a tarnished reputation is inherent to any secure facility. 
Mike Maughan, who’s lived in Vermont for more than a decade, grew up in foster care and youth shelters in Pennsylvania. At age 15, he was stuck in a juvenile detention facility for a year and a half when officials could not find a therapeutic setting to treat him in, he said. 
The secure facility was not designed to heal him but rather contain him, Maughan said. Grouped together with violent kids, he suffered a traumatic brain injury when he was caught in the middle of an altercation and hit by a chair that had been thrown, he said. 
He doesn’t want the same thing to happen in Vermont. Maughan doesn’t think it’s possible for a company like Sentinel to run a facility that’s truly therapeutic, he said. 
He finds the design of Red Clover and the Green Mountain Youth Campus to be problematic — “it’s just the perfect environment for abuse of youth and staff,” he said. 
He sees the abuse as a symptom of the model. In that setting, kids are always in a vulnerable position and at the hands of a power imbalance, Maughan said. Sometimes that imbalance becomes dangerous for everyone. 
“When you go into work and you have the same youth try and punch you in the head and call you an asshole everyday for six months or so, there’s a good chance — and I’ve definitely seen it — staff will just snap,” Maughan said. 
The harm is greater when the company running the facility is not held responsible. 
“They are experts in deflecting accountability,” Maughan said. 
Warn, the legal advocate for youth, agrees. 
Rather than a privately run facility, Warn said he would prefer the state construct and run its own program, as it did with Woodside. As a guardian ad litem, he’s able to inspect any state and court records related to the youth he works with, but he cannot access records solely held by a private program like Sentinel. 
Though he’s had a positive experience with Red Clover’s staff, he views reliance on any private provider as flawed. 
“The fact that it exists is a big failure in our system,” Warn said.

With an appeals court ruling looming, federal officials indicate they won’t start rounding up horses where elimination is the end goal until Aug. 25.
The post Wild horses in Wyoming’s ‘checkerboard’ region get 6-week reprieve from whole-herd removals appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal authorities are delaying deploying helicopters and ground teams to eliminate free-roaming horses from a 2.1-million-acre region in southern Wyoming. 
After years of litigation, the Bureau of Land Management had been fast approaching a Tuesday start date for roundups aiming to permanently remove the Salt Wells Creek and Great Divide Basin herds, plus the northwestern portion of Adobe Town Herd. That’s been postponed for six weeks, however, as horse advocates attempting to halt the operations await an opinion from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.
There’d been some confusion with BLM roundups set to commence Tuesday within the Adobe Town Herd. But those operations are being limited to areas to the south and east where some horses will be allowed to remain (between 259 and 536 horses are considered the “appropriate management level” for remaining reaches of the Adobe Town Herd). 
“We did confirm with the Justice Department, who put it in writing to us, that they would not go outside of [the] Rawlins portion of the Adobe Town [herd] before Aug. 25,” said Bill Eubanks, an attorney representing the American Wild Horse Campaign, Western Watersheds Project, Animal Welfare Institute and some individual plaintiffs. 

Over the course of 2025 and 2026, the Bureau of Land Management is planning to fully remove roaming horses from herd management areas illustrated in this map. 
Aug. 25 is the new listed start date in the BLM’s tentative horse gather schedule for the complete removal operations. Those efforts, planned to go until Oct. 23, will occur in areas occupied by the balance of the Adobe Town Herd and Salt Wells Creek Herd. Roundups to eliminate the Great Divide Basin Herd are planned for 2026, though the removal operations for all three herds could take several years and have uncertain timelines. 
BLM-Wyoming officials could not be immediately reached for an interview Monday. 
Taken together, the two horse gather operations soon to unfold in southern Wyoming’s checkerboard region are the largest nationwide in 2025. Just shy of 3,597 free-roaming horses are being targeted, according to the BLM’s schedule. 
Rounded-up horses cannot be killed because of protections afforded by the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act. Initially, animals are brought to temporary holding facilities. Some are then disposed of via adoption and sales programs. Many others, however, will live out the rest of their lives on private pastureland in places like the Centennial Valley west of Laramie.

Free-roaming horses, which experts consider non-native, can wreak havoc on native species like sage grouse when left unmanaged. An overpopulated herd inflicted devastating damage on the Wind River Indian Reservation until recently, though the rangeland bounced back after large-scale roundups in 2022 and 2023.
An icon of the West, the horses have been a part of the landscape for half a millennium. Unlike other exotic mammals, like feral pigs, they’ve amassed dedicated advocates who’ve long fought for their cause. 
The dispute over horses in southwest Wyoming’s checkerboard region — a 40-mile-wide region where public and private land meet at common corners — traces back to 2010. That year, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for horses to roam its property.

Both advocates for livestock and wild horses have sued over the issue, though the BLM emerged victorious in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming about a year ago and then proposed, and approved, its whole-herd removal plans. 
Horse advocates subsequently appealed. Eubanks represented horse advocates in a dispute over the same issue in 2016, when the plaintiffs prevailed in the 10th Circuit. Seven years later, he’s posing a similar argument: that the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act only allows entire herds to be eliminated “to provide a thriving, natural ecological balance.”
“That’s the phrase in the act,” Eubanks told WyoFile. “You can’t just say, ‘Well, some private folks don’t like it, so let’s just wipe out our federally protected wildlife.’” 
Although the litigated roundups are now set to start in about six weeks, Eubanks said it’s unknown when the opinion will come down from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
“​​We just wait,” he said. “We hope it comes out each day so that we can understand next steps.”

Trump administration has no right to withhold. 
The funding, which includes $53.6 million for Connecticut, was slated for professional development, after school programs, adult education and students learning English. The money was earmarked for the 2025-26 school year, meaning local school districts would soon have to figure out how to adjust their budgets to make up for the gap.
“Without [the funding], programs and positions may be cut, vacancies left unfilled, and vulnerable students left further behind,” the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, an organization representing Connecticut’s 169 towns, said in a statement after the federal fund withholding was announced late last month. 
The loss is projected to affect nearly every district in Connecticut. The largest losses will be in the state’s urban centers. Hartford Public Schools are projected to lose about $3 million. Bridgeport is slated to lose $3.8 million. 
The lawsuit, filed on Monday, argues that Congress requires this money be sent to the states by a certain date, and that the executive branch cannot refuse to do so. While agencies like the Department of Education can ask Congress for the ability to revoke payments lawmakers have approved, the lawsuit argues the Trump administration hasn’t taken the necessary steps to be able to do that. 
“ This is Congress’ power, not the president’s power,” Attorney General William Tong said at a press conference Monday. “[President Trump] has hijacked, usurped, taken away, just totally unlawfully stepped in, where he does not have the authority, to take power away from Congress.” 
Normally, the federal government makes 25% of annual funding available to states on July 1. But this year, states received notice on June 30 that the administration was reviewing the funding for certain grant programs and that the money would not be released. 
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the June 30 email, as quoted in the lawsuit, read. 
The impacted grants include Title II, which pays for things like teacher recruitment, professional development and teacher training. Also included are Title III grants, which pay for programs teaching children learning to speak English, and Title IV, which funds a variety of initiatives, including mental health counseling, drug and violence prevention programs, science and math programs, college and career counseling and investments in technology. 
“ This is the big ticket stuff that we, as a state, and local school districts have depended on for decades, for 60 years,” Tong said. 
The grants were first established in a law passed in 1965, according to the lawsuit. Tong said he was not aware of any past administrations who had refused to release these grants to the states.
Connecticut House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, criticized the Democrats for the lawsuit in a statement, saying they’d failed to reconsider their own priorities “despite the President’s clear intent to disrupt the Biden-era status quo that failed just about every Connecticut student.” 
“Instead of holding near-daily press conferences, Democrats here would serve Connecticut better by working with federal officials in partnership to produce positive outcomes for everyone, whether it be students, educators, or taxpayers,” Candelora told the Connecticut Mirror. 
Gov. Ned Lamont sees things differently. Speaking at the press conference alongside Tong, the governor criticized the federal government’s “herky-jerky” method of distributing funds to the states, and disputed that the cuts were being done with the goal of reducing “waste, fraud and abuse.” 
“ These are afterschool programs. Programs that help us recruit teachers, programs that help our kids get back on their feet. These are the programs that are being yanked away,” Lamont said. 
Mike McKeon, an attorney for the Connecticut State Department of Education, said the loss of funds was “blowing a hole” in the budgets of local school districts, which were already finalized with the assumption that they would have this money to work with.

Kate Dias, president of the Connecticut Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, said that after school programs and before school programs were at risk. “We can still open school if we don’t have before and after school programs. But what is the quality of the before and after school experience, and then how does that impact the day? That’s really important to us as educators,” she said.
Mental health counseling would also be at risk, she said, and programs focused on teaching English as a second language would probably be scaled back. 
Mary Yordon, vice president of the Connecticut chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, also noted that the funds had been supporting “established programs” for students and additional learning for teachers. 
“ Teachers across Connecticut are attending conferences and workshops to learn the new techniques, the latest brain-based science and the science of reading, and all of the other techniques that we need to keep ourselves current and to keep our practices efficient and effective,” she said. 
Justin Harmon, spokesperson for New Haven Public Schools, said the $3.1 million his district could lose was supposed  to fund teacher development, bilingual instructors for students learning English, internship coordinators, anti-bullying programs, credit recovery programs and college courses at the high school level. 
“We remain hopeful that these funds will become available,” he said.
In Hartford, the funds at risk include $2 million for adult education programs teaching citizenship and language classes, as well as $900,000 for “Student Support and Success” centers, which focus on helping students who are behind in their academic credits catch up to where they need to be. The district also stands to lose $1.1 million in professional learning and $500,000 for coaches and a coordinator for students learning English. 
Dr. Alberto Vazquez-Matos, superintendent of Middletown Public Schools, said the $861,000 his district stands to lose would make it difficult to provide similar services. “These funds are crucial to maintaining the integrity of programs that serve our diverse student population and help ensure equitable access to learning opportunities throughout our community,” he said in a statement to CT Mirror. 
Nonprofits that offer after school programs may also see their funding cut. 
Amanda Steffen, director of marketing and communications for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Hartford said the organization receives funding from one of the federal grants for after school programs. While it remains unclear whether her organization will receive the grant, she said it will continue to operate either way. 
“Safe and supportive places for kids and teens to go in the afternoon and evening are critical community resources,” the nonprofit’s vice president of development & communication, Tomeka Cole, said in a statement. “For us, every dollar matters but Boys & Girls Clubs of Hartford is fortunate to have diversified funding sources. We continue to work with local supporters and donors to ensure that we will always be able to offer our programming and services to all young people, especially those who need us the most.”
The attorney general said he was confident in the claims the states were making in their lawsuit, but said the legal battle could be challenging. 
“It’s going to get tougher as we move up in the U.S. Court of Appeals, but attorneys general are fighting tooth and nail every single day,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EDUCATION-AGLAWSUIT-0714-Cannon-DE-210-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 18:09:52.032516

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — While pointing to mismanagement as the cause of mass layoffs and program cuts at Epic Charter School, state officials agreed Monday to hire an accounting firm to investigate further and recommend corrective action.
The Statewide Charter School Board voted unanimously to authorize its staff to hire auditors to look into financial and operational decisions that led to Epic’s recent crisis, a decision the school’s leaders say they support. The statewide board’s staff has been looking into finances at Epic, Oklahoma’s biggest virtual charter school and third-largest school district, since May and so far has found no evidence of fraud.
However, members of the board questioned why Epic administrators didn’t cut expenses sooner while the school’s main revenue source, student enrollment, dramatically decreased over the past four years.

The board’s financial compliance officer and on-staff CPA, Skyler Lusnia, said Epic administrators had overestimated revenue and underestimated expenses, putting the school at risk of insolvency. 
“I think ‘mismanagement’ is probably a really good word to have said,” Lusnia told the board. “Because while, again, we have not isolated or identified any fraud, if you look at the projections for revenue and expenditures versus actuals, it was just clear and obvious that it should have been pointed out sooner.”
The ensuing budget shortfall resulted in two rounds of mass layoffs during the 2024-25 school year that cut a total of 501 employees. Epic replaced its superintendent, Bart Banfield, and deputy superintendent of finance, Jeanise Wynn, amid the fallout.
“Epic Charter Schools supports the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board action today calling for an outside accounting firm to review the finances and organizational processes of Oklahoma’s largest virtual public charter school,” interim Superintendent Justin Hunt said in a statement. “Epic has been and remains committed to working closely with SCSB to ensure safeguards are in place to secure the long-term financial stability of the organization, so we can continue to provide the best possible educational experience and outcomes for the approximately 30,000 students and families we serve statewide.” 
Staff and program cuts helped Epic finish the 2025 fiscal year out of the red, but the school will have to rely on a $30 million line of credit to cover necessary expenses over the next few months, Lusnia said.
Epic enrolled about 30,000 students in the 2024-25 school year, about half as many as in 2020-21. Enrollment skyrocketed to 60,000 students in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic as families flocked to online learning, but it has steadily declined ever since.
In his first meeting since being re-appointed to the statewide board, William Pearson questioned why school leaders didn’t respond to the decreasing enrollment with corresponding cuts to staffing and expenses.

Pearson, who is the Senate president pro tem’s choice to replace departing board member Becky Gooch, served on the board in 2023 and 2024 when it focused solely on virtual charter schools like Epic.
“If you see your revenue stream is drying up, then you’ve got to make the necessary adjustments,” Pearson said during the meeting.
Board chairperson Brian Shellem said the audit will investigate what information which school administrators knew and when. It also should address how informed and involved Epic’s governing board was during that timeline.
At this point, he said, it seems “crystal clear” there was negligence.
“Timing is a critical point for many things in life, right?” Shellem said during the meeting. “If you’re driving down the road and it curves, if you wait 10 seconds maybe you miss the curve.”

On June 9, Nessel alongside the attorneys general for Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia filed a suit against U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and set of gun rights groups and manufacturers, arguing President Donald Trump’s administration aimed to distribute thousands of machine gun conversion devices into communities throughout the country. 
While the plaintiff states sought a preliminary injunction to block the return and sale of forced reset triggers – devices that dramatically increase a firearms rate of fire – the states dropped the motion on Friday following word from the federal government that it would not return the devices to owners in states where they have been banned.

Those states include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington.
Matthew Varisco, assistant director for the Office of Field Operations within the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in a June 27 court filing said that owners where these devices are illegal can request for the devices to be transferred to them in a state where they are legal to possess, have them transferred to a third party in a state where they are legal or abandon the device to the bureau.  
Additionally, Rare Breed Triggers, the nation’s largest purveyor of forced reset triggers confirmed it would not sell the devices in states where they are restricted.
“These dangerous conversion devices have no place in our communities, and I am proud that our legal efforts have ensured they are kept out of Michigan,” Nessel said in a statement. “This outcome shows that when we challenge reckless and illegal federal actions, we can protect lives.

The court-appointed receiver who has worked to help Jay Peak Resort and Burke Mountain Resort emerge from a financial scandal has been granted his request for more than $1 million to help cover his latest costs and expenses for himself and others helping him.
With a judge’s approval Monday, Michael Goldberg’s total bill for his receivership that began in April 2016 has surpassed $13 million.
Goldberg’s latest filing submitted earlier this month covered the receivership from June 1, 2024, through April 30 of this year. For that 11 month period, Goldberg said the receivership amassed $1,185,240 in costs and expenses.
“During the Reporting and Application Period,” Goldberg wrote in the 262-page filing, “the Receiver and his team of professionals made significant progress towards winding down the Receivership and maximizing the value of the estate’s remaining assets for the benefit of defrauded Jay Peak and Burke investors.”
The two resorts were put in receivership in April 2016 after federal and state regulators brought civil enforcement actions against Ariel Quiros, the owner of both resorts, and Bill Stenger, who was Jay Peak’s CEO and president.

Officials alleged in the legal actions the two men misused more than $200 million of the more than $350 million raised from foreign investors through the federal EB-5 visa program. The program allows foreign investors to obtain green cards, or permanent U.S. residency, in exchange for financial investments in qualified development projects.   
Quiros and Stenger were later indicted in May 2019 on criminal charges connected to a separate EB-5-financed planned project they headed in the Northeast Kingdom to build a $110 million biomedical research facility, which regulators later called “nearly a complete fraud.”
The two men eventually reached plea deals with prosecutors, sending both of them to prison. Stenger has since been released, and Quiros remains in custody in a federal facility in Florida. 
Goldberg, in his filing this month, wrote that a great deal of his work focused on the sale of Burke Mountain Resort earlier this year for $11.5 million to Bear Den Partners LLC, a group of people with longtime ties to the ski area. 
The sale of Burke Mountain Resort followed the sale of Jay Peak Resort in 2022 to Pacific Group Resorts Inc., based in Park City, Utah, for $76 million.
Goldberg wrote in his filing that the resort was still working to sell “one off” properties in Vermont that are part of the receivership, which he “hopes to accomplish in the next six months.” Those remaining properties, including undeveloped land, were turned over to the receivership as part of a $84 million settlement Quiros reached with regulators to resolve civil enforcement actions against him.   
Federal Judge Darrin P. Gayles, who has presided in U.S. District Court in Miami over the receivership since it began in April 2016, approved Goldberg’s request Monday. The case was brought in federal court in Florida because that was where Quiros was living at the time the civil enforcement actions were brought against him.
As a result of Gayles’ approval of Goldberg’s latest fee request, the receivership’s legal and financial costs and expenses totals a little more than $13.5 million since it was established in 2016.
Money to pay those bills has come from revenue generated from the sale of the properties as well as financial settlements reached with several entities over the years for their roles in the financial scandal.
Goldberg could not be reached Monday for comment.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)On a sunny, clear Friday afternoon in Helena, more than 50 people turned out for a Pride Shabbat celebration on the grass grounds of Temple Emanu-El.
The Montana Jewish Project hosted the Pride Shabbat celebration, aimed at bringing the community together. It was a festive, joyful event with serious undertones. On Friday, discussion at the Pride Shabbat dove into the connections between Montana’s LGBTQ and Jewish communities and the issues they face.
Greg Holzman, a Montana Jewish Project board member, said it was easy to “get lost” in what’s happening nationally and the world, calling it “overwhelming and very challenging.” Holzman also connected anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. 
Anger and discrimination aimed at those two communities often comes from the same place, he said.
“It all kind of comes from and plays in the same playground,” Holzman said.
He added that events like the Pride Shabbat are a way to bring a little control back and bring people together. 
Temple Emanu-El has become a gathering place for members of the Jewish faith and the building is steeped deep in Helena and state history. It’s now a museum and a place to talk about current topics.
“LGBTQ community members have been part of the MJP story from the very beginning, not just supporting it, but helping shape what we’ve become,” said Rebecca Stanfel, a member of the organization. “This event is one way to honor that legacy.”
According to a 2023 poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, 80% of Jewish people support same-sex marriage. The only two groups higher were Buddhists (82%) and Americans who are religiously unaffiliated (86%).
A Helena Police Officer was on duty watching and protecting the event and several attendees spoke about threats members of the Jewish community has received, a longstanding issue in Montana.
Erin Vang, a member of the Montana Jewish Project, spoke about the localization of some of the major issues impacting minority communities. She pointed to the Stonewall Riots as a point where people said they “had enough.”
“We’re in a phase of extreme backlash by a hateful white nationalist culture of toxic masculinity that is frightened about losing control, that is threatened by the progress we’ve made,” Vang said. “This is a time that calls us to action, and the action starts at home and right here with those gathered today. I think our Jewish history has some lessons for us about what we face.”
Vang also spoke about the recent detention of Christopher Martinez in Helena by ICE.
“Our larger community had to rally this week to call on our officials to resist the unlawful detention of one of our neighbors whose only crime appears to have been expired plates, but we have every reason to think that his real crime was having brown skin and he wasn’t even arrested,” Vang said. “He was kidnapped by an illegitimate agency, working in secret, wearing masks without any of the norms of due process that true justice requires.”
She added the patterns were “far too familiar to us as Jews.” 
Vang called on people with privilege to speak out and protect their communities.
“If you have enough privilege in your life to choose to be visible,” Vang said. “You also have enough power to make a difference by being visible.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PrideShabbat-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-07-14 18:09:52.032516
,DC,2025-07-14 21:30:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Supreme Court allows Trump to carry out plan to dismantle Education Department for now,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-allows-trump-carry-out-plan-dismantle-education-department-now,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration, for now, to proceed with mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the Education Department ordered earlier this year.The decision from the nation’s highest court marks a major victory for President Donald Trump, who has sought to overhaul the federal role in education.The order was unsigned, while Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, indicating a 6-3 decision.The dissent, authored by Sotomayor, was scathing.“The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive,” she wrote. “But either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave.”The Supreme Court’s order temporarily suspends lower court orders that: forced the agency to reinstate more than 1,300 employees gutted from a reduction in force, or RIF, effort; blocked the department from carrying out Trump’s executive order to dismantle the department; and barred the agency from transferring some services to other federal agencies.In a statement Monday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon celebrated the decision, saying “today, the Supreme Court again confirmed the obvious: the President of the United States, as the head of the Executive Branch, has the ultimate authority to make decisions about staffing levels, administrative organization, and day-to-day operations of federal agencies.”“While today’s ruling is a significant win for students and families, it is a shame that the highest court in the land had to step in to allow President Trump to advance the reforms Americans elected him to deliver using the authorities granted to him by the U.S. Constitution,” she said.“The U.S. Department of Education will now deliver on its mandate to restore excellence in American education. We will carry out the reduction in force to promote efficiency and accountability and to ensure resources are directed where they matter most — to students, parents, and teachers.”A coalition of teachers, unions and school districts that sued over Trump’s order to eliminate the department and the mass layoffs said they were “incredibly disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision to allow the Trump-Vance administration to proceed with its harmful efforts to dismantle the Department of Education while our case moves forward.”“This unlawful plan will immediately and irreparably harm students, educators and communities across our nation. Children will be among those hurt the most by this decision. We will never stop fighting on behalf of all students and public schools and the protections, services, and resources they need to thrive,” they added.Challenge from Democratic state AGs, unionsThe labor and advocacy coalition and a slew of Democratic attorneys general each sued in March over some of the administration’s most consequential education initiatives.One of the lawsuits comes from a coalition of Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.The other lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts.A Massachusetts federal judge consolidated the lawsuits and granted the states’ and groups’ preliminary injunction in May.The administration appealed that decision, leading to a June decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit keeping in place the district court’s order.The Trump administration then asked the Supreme Court to intervene.",,,,2025-07-14 18:09:52.032516

Lawyer Alex Rate, with the ACLU of Montana, also represents plaintiffs. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)The Montana Legislature didn’t just pass an unconstitutional law when it supported House Bill 458, a 2023 law which narrowly defined “male” and “female.” It also left taxpayers with a hefty legal tab, according to a ruling from a Missoula County District Court judge.
Judge Shane A. Vanatta of Missoula County, ruled on Monday the State of Montana owes attorneys, including those who work for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, nearly $100,000 in the case for having to fight to vindicate — or keep — Montanans’ constitutional rights. Vanatta found that the Legislature’s definition of two and only two biological sexes violated the state’s constitution, while potentially ignoring the science about gender, identity, and biology.
While the law was declared void more than a year ago, lawyer in the case have been at odds about the attorneys’ fees charged by ACLU lawyers and lawyers with a Mountain West law firm, Holland and Hart, which has offices in Billings. The ACLU had asked for nearly $100,000 in fees — or $95,49.63 to be exact — while the state balked at the amount, saying the fees should be between $35,000 and $40,000, according to the state’s expert witness.
Vanatta said that while both sides offered expert testimony from other lawyers, Missoula attorney Charles Hansberry, who had previously worked for Holland and Hart, as well as founding his own law firm, had made the more persuasive arguments and detailed review of the work.
One of the issues in the case was how many attorneys the ACLU had while litigating the case.
“Although there were four attorneys working on the case, (Hansberry) did not see duplication of effort reflected in the billing entries and noted that the state had assigned more than four attorneys to the defense of the case,” the court order said.
The judge also agreed with the ACLU and Hansberry the case needed experienced attorneys in constitutional law, something that is more uncommon for Montana courts and comes with a higher rate because of the specialty within the legal arena.
“Hansberry opined that the litigation was very important in defending the constitutional rights of a minority class in our society that is under significant attack for their gender identity,” the judge said. “He believes that there is a trend of passing unconstitutional legislation by the Montana Legislature to target this minority group; he believed the recovery of attorney fees was appropriate as a price for passing unconstitutional legislation.”
Patrick Risken, an attorney who formerly worked for the Attorney General’s Office, provided testimony for the state, but Vanatta said that Risken’s work was not as “complete” or “detailed,” and even he had acknowledged attorneys used in higher profile constitutional cases in the state often made more than $500 per hour.
“Mr. Risken did not review any time entries for the State of Montana attorneys because they don’t keep track of time expended on cases,” the court order said. “He has no idea how much time was spent by state attorneys on the subject case. He does not believe it is important to know what time was spent by the state given he does not expect an opponent to match time hour for hour.”
Attorneys for the state also argued that plaintiffs, as represented by the ACLU, should be entitled to fewer attorneys fees because originally some of the lawyers had agreed to participate in the case pro bono. The state also argued that paying for the plaintiffs’ attorneys would be essentially compelling speech by the taxpayer — meaning they were forced into agreeing with the courts.
However, Vanatta dismissed both of those arguments in his order.
“First, any award is payable to the attorneys who provided the legal services; what those attorneys do with the money upon receipt is immaterial,” Vanatta said.
State attorneys had argued that Holland and Hart had planned to donate any funds to the ACLU, therefore the state should not be required to pay them since it would result in a larger amount for the organization.
“Second, the taxpayers of the State of Montana are not being completed to say (or not say) anything; rather, they are required to pay fees to the prevailing party’s attorneys who provided legal services. No endorsement of specific speech is required or compelled,” Vanatta said.

(Photo by Jim Argo/Courtesy of the Oklahoma Historical Society)OKLAHOMA CITY – Restaurants at five Oklahoma parks are set to reopen Tuesday after the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation recently suspended operations in the midst of a contract dispute.
The agency and vendor, the Lookout Kitchen, on Monday reached a conditional agreement to reopen the restaurants at Beavers Bend, Lake Murray, Robbers Cave, Roman Nose and Quartz Mountain state parks, the agency said in a press release. 
Operations were suspended July 8.
The vendor has agreed to pay past due monthly payments totaling $274,585.88.
The first payment totaling $65,000 was submitted Monday, according to the agency. Five more payments are scheduled between July 28 and Nov. 15.
“This agreement to reopen Lookout restaurants inside our state parks is a positive development for our park guests as we work to minimize disruptions to park operations,” said Sterling Zearley, Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation executive director. “The agreed upon payment plan gives Lookout a pathway to compliance, while also providing a valuable amenity to state park visitors.”
Brian Buswell, an attorney for Lookout Kitchen, said he had no comment Monday.

(Photo by Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Twenty-eight cities and counties including Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, and Rochester, New York, joined a lawsuit July 10 challenging Trump administration attempts to withhold federal funds because of local policies on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; gender equity; and abortion access.
Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights, and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties, and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.”
The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

Jeff Landry announced Monday he will name the state’s largest National Guard training site after a little-known early 19th century Louisiana militia member and slaveowner, the father of the Confederate general whose name the facility originally carried. 
The Louisiana National Guard Training Facility in Pineville will once again be known as Camp Beauregard, which had been its name until 2023 when the state joined a nationwide effort to remove monuments and honorifics to Confederate veterans and leaders. 
The site was previously named after Gen. Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, who initiated the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, to begin the Civil War. It will now be named after Capt. Jacques Toutant Beauregard, a member of the Louisiana Militia who reportedly fought in the 1815 Battle of New Orleans. Jacques Toutant Beauregard is P.G.T. Beauregard’s father, Louisiana National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. Noel Collins confirmed to the Illuminator. 
Landry announced the renaming of the facility with a social media post that included a seemingly AI-generated image of a headstone that reads “Wokeism.” 
“By restoring the name Camp Beauregard, we honor a legacy of courage and service that dates back over two centuries,” Landry said in a news release. “Let this also be a lesson that we should always give reverence to history and not be quick to so easily condemn or erase the dead, lest we and our times be judged arbitrary by future generations.”
The governor’s news release does not mention the Beauregards are related to each other. 
P.G.T. Beauregard, a native of St. Bernard Parish, was the first Confederate to receive the rank of general after Louisiana seceded from the United States. He would later take advantage of the mass pardons for treason offered to former Confederate officers and officials by President Andrew Johnson. The former general was reportedly reluctant to swear an oath of allegiance to the United States but was persuaded to do so by Johnson and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. 
After his return to Louisiana, P.G.T. Beauregard became a railroad superintendent and argued for Black voting rights in order to remove the radical Republicans who had gained control of state and local government during the Reconstruction period. 
According to a Louisiana National Guard news release, Jacques Toutant Beauregard was a member of the Louisiana Militia whose regiment took part in a fight that was a prelude to the Battle of New Orleans.
Jacques Toutant Beauregard was the owner of a sugarcane farm in St. Bernard Parish later named the Contreras Plantation, where P.G.T. Beauregard was born. The Beauregard family owned slaves on the plantation, according to T. Harry Williams’ biography “P.G.T. Beauregard, Napoleon in Gray.” 
In the news release, Maj. Gen. Thomas Friloux, adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, praised Jacques Toutant Beauregard as an American hero.
“We’re naming our premier training installation after an American hero and patriot who fought for the freedom of the city of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana, and the United States of America against a foreign invader,” Friloux said.

(Photo courtesy of Rev. Minna Bothwell)As Iowa Christian faith leaders are preparing for the impact President Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill act” will have on their parishioners, many of them are voicing their opinions to the communities they serve. 
The expansive bill includes cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, health care services, additional work requirements and new immigration policies. 
“With the ‘big, beautiful bill,’ I keep thinking to myself, we have so many generous people in the neighborhood and we have so many generous organizations but can those institutions and those people continue to be as generous once this bill goes through?” said Rev. Lizzie Gillman, priest at St. Andrews Episcopal Church in Des Moines. 
What faith communities are hearing from their leaders
“The Gospel in itself is political in the sense that laws and policies affect people and people are made in the image of God,” Rev. Minna Bothwell, pastor of Capital Hill Lutheran Church in Des Moines said. “We are called as a church to tend and care for God’s people.”
The social justice committee at Capitol Hill Lutheran Church made a post urging parishioners to contact Congressman Zach Nunn and “let them know this budget does not reflect your values or your faith.” Bothwell said she “stays true to the text,” of the Gospel and whenever Jesus addresses “something difficult in the community,” she will talk about it on Sunday.

The church’s social justice committee meets weekly to discuss the church’s missions “to address the concerns of the community and the impact bills and laws have on real people that we serve every single day.”
Pastor Joseph Hall of Crossroads Church in Council Bluffs also openly discusses his political beliefs with parishioners. 
“If we can’t talk about it in church, where are they going to hear it? You know, from the lame-stream media? From liberals? They’re not quiet about their beliefs and their stance and so I’m the same,” Hall said. “I can’t sit silent because somebody’s going to teach my people, one way or the other. They better hear it from me, from a biblical, faith standpoint.”
Recently in a court filing, the Internal Revenue Service stated churches could openly campaign and endorse candidates. Hall responded to this news in a Facebook post, stating “This pastor endorsed without their permission. But thank you anyway. Maybe now more pastors won’t sit silently while their nation is at stake?!” 
He said he has been named “America’s most patriotic pastor” by several sources, including the book “Donald Trump’s Army of God,” by Clifford Cook and Anise Cook, a book on Christian nationalists in Iowa. However, Hall says he wears the title “proudly,” and claims the reporters tried to “give us a bad name.”
When Trump was running his campaign in Iowa, Hall served as a caucus captain and “hosted multiple events for the Trump team.” He has also opened multiple Trump rallies including the recent America250 kickoff at the Iowa State Fairgrounds.
Hall claims the separation of church and state has always been taught wrong: “It was never to take the church out of the state, it wasn’t to take people of faith out of the government, it was to not allow the government to control the church,” and that “godly, biblical values should direct every policy in office.” 
The Rt. Rev. Betsy Monnet, 10th bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Iowa, however, says that within the Episcopal church “all of our sermons ought to be based on the Gospel.” She said the church is “attempting to preach the Gospel” and “the values that are behind it” but parishioners may not hear their priests referring specifically to pieces of legislation or “individual political positions.”
“Somebody who goes to an Episcopal church will probably hear prayers for the hungry, for the poor. Prayers for immigrants and prayers for those who are in danger. Prayers for those who are seeking healthcare and so on. Prayers for our creation, that we might be good stewards of it,” Monnet said. 
Cuts to SNAP benefits
The Congressional Budget Office states the total federal spending for SNAP will be reduced by $287 billion between 2025 and 2034. According to a study done by Feeding America, this number is roughly equivalent to between 6 billion and 9  billion meals per year.
Brother James Dowd is a Benedictine monk and founder of The Benedictine Way in Omaha. His work as a monk has taken him to congregations across Iowa and the surrounding states, including a recent visit to St. Paul’s Episcopal Cathedral in Des Moines.
At St. Paul’s, he delivered a homily urging members of the congregation to “love urgently” those impacted by the bill passing, specifically including immigrants, the trans individuals and those who will lose SNAP benefits.
According to Dowd, the Omaha neighborhood where his team hosts a food pantry has an unemployment rate of around 8%, compared to the rest of the city where it’s “virtually nonexistent.” He said between the cuts to the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement and the cuts to SNAP benefits, his St. Benedict’s Food Pantry will see two things: “the folks who are already coming will need more help and new people are going to be coming on top of it.” 
His team’s pantry operates two days a week, Saturday morning and Tuesday afternoons. The Saturday morning slots are mostly attended by elderly individuals, he said.
“The decision they’re making is ‘Do I pay for medicine, do I pay for food?’ And that can literally be a life-threatening decision,” Dowd said. 
On Tuesday afternoons, Dowd sees mostly mothers with young children who “just can’t make ends meet.” He said watching them coming home from work and picking their kids up but struggling to feed their kids is “the most heartbreaking.”

However, Hall sees “things a little differently.”
“We try to bridge the gap and meet the need but then, not just give stuff away,” Hall said. “That’s not why we’re called, we’re called to lead them to a better life, to making better decisions, being better people, better citizens, better Christians.”
Crossroads Church in Council Bluffs doesn’t have any on-site outreach ministries but instead organizes a food and clothes drive for the local New Visions Homeless Services and hosts fundraising efforts “several times a year.” 
Hall is a U.S. Army veteran and has served as lead pastor of Crossroads Church for just shy of 13 years. 
“When hard-working, law-abiding, American-loving patriots take more money, that’s a good thing. A big, beautiful thing. This is the greatest tax break in U.S. history,” he said. 
Hall added, “the big, beautiful bill is a big, beautiful win” for the faith community, Christians, the church, the nation, and for citizens. He believes this budget bill will “secure our future,” for both “America and Americans.” 
Under the budget bill, beginning in 2027, taxpayers will be able to claim a credit of up to $1,700 a year to be used as qualified donations that support private K-12 school scholarships.
Hall says this “tax-credit for school choice” is a good thing for the faith community as it gives people of faith, who couldn’t afford it before, the chance to send their kids to a Christian school and “get them out of the woke public school system where liberal, evil teachers are indoctrinating our children.” 
The Iowa Department of Education already operates the Students First Education Savings Account. These accounts give taxpayer dollars totaling $7,826 per student for the 2024-2025 school year to eligible families to use on private school tuition and expenses. 
He also believes the new federal law protects religious freedoms and claims “the last administration was attacking and trying to eliminate” those freedoms.
“The impact of this bill is huge. It’s the most pro-family, pro-worker, pro-Christian, pro-American bill ever passed, that’s why it’s called ‘big and beautiful,’” said Hall. “Plain and simple, its America first. Not illegals, not other countries.”
Reactions to immigration policies 
Bothwell calls the deportation-focused provisions in the budget bill “devastating,” claiming it will “tear families apart” and “send people to communities that are unsafe.” She said for families who are seeking asylum from political violence, “there are already quite a few fees to even get an attorney to help you file for asylum and file for a permit,” which will be exacerbated by the new fees introduced. 
The new fees required by this bill include:

a $100 non-waivable fee to apply for asylum and a $100 annual fee for each year the application is pending.
A new application fee of $250 for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status.
An increased, non-waivable fee from $50 to $500 when applying for Temporary Protected status.
An increased fee of $550 for an initial work permit based on asylum applications.
A fee of $275 for each renewal or exemption of employment authorization.

“It’s putting individuals who are already vulnerable in a more vulnerable place. I see our calling as Christians to ease burdens, not to create tolls,” she said. “These punitive fees punish families who are fleeing violence and seeking safety which then compounds trauma with financial strain. Financial strain that already exists before this bill goes into practice.”
Hall, however, believes in stricter rules. 
“Stricter rules on illegals, undocumented immigrants is a good thing just as stricter rules on criminals is a good thing. No consequences on criminals leads to greater crime,” Hall said. 
This bill rewards and enforces “buying American, making American, staying in America,” he said. “The fact of the matter is, if we are true and true Americans, we should love America and we should support America. If we don’t love it, then you should find somewhere else to live.”
“I don’t think it’s prudent budgeting as much as it is a denial of dignity,” Bothwell said. “These are people, they’re not faceless statistics, they’re our neighbors, they are made in God’s image and we are called to love and support them.”
Bothwell’s parish is composed of members “born on five different continents, and are from 23 different countries.” She says many of the members in her congregation rely on SNAP programs and her parish helps them apply for food assistance. 
She referenced a study conducted by the Iowa Hunger Coalition that states over 60% of SNAP recipients report the affordability of healthy foods as a barrier to healthy diets, saying “over 60% of these recipients are working families they just don’t earn enough to cover the cost of utilities.”
“Adding work requirements doesn’t create self-sufficiency, it just kicks people off of programs who are already struggling to get by,” she said. “It’s kind of like, I don’t know, pulling a ladder away from somebody, right? And then blaming them for not climbing the ladder you’ve just pulled away.”
Work requirements
Beginning on Dec. 31, 2026, beneficiaries of Medicaid ages 19-64 will have to work 80 hours a month to be eligible for benefits. Currently, beneficiaries of SNAP programs without dependents aged 19-54 need to work for more than three months in three years.
The new work requirement will require beneficiaries ages 18-64 and those with children aged 14 years and up to work the same length of time, but it is currently unclear when these requirements will go into effect. 
Hall believes “restrictions are a good thing” because unrestricted access to food can “more times than not, enable their situation and enable their mindset.” He said setting rules ensures people won’t “take advantage of the system.” 
He quotes 2 Thessalonians 3:10 “For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: ‘The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat,’” to give a biblical argument for the implementation of work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid benefits. “The Bible is clear, it says if a man doesn’t work, he doesn’t deserve,” he claims.
“A work requirement is just another hoop for people to jump through, if you’ve seen the actual SNAP application, it’s like 15 pages long. You don’t easily get into the program, it takes a lot of work,” said Heather Wachendorf, minister of New Beginnings Christian Church in Urbandale. “And if you’re involved in recertification and you’re out there trying to find a job or a better paying job, it’s another job just to ensure you have what you need.”
Wachendorf’s parish opened up a “community food closet” in part to address some of the shortcomings of the food pantry system. 
“Most food pantries are part of a network and you can only go to one food pantry in the network, once a month. And when you go, you only get three days worth of food. And so that just leaves a really big gap,” Wachendorf said. “We decided to open up our food closet to be a give what you can, take what you need model.”
In addition to addressing a specific need, by keeping the closet accessible and unmonitored 24/7, Wachendorf believes this model allows people to “maintain their dignity and their privacy.” Wachendorf’s parish partners with other churches to combine efforts in addressing food insecurity in their communities including St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church.

Every Friday morning, Gillman’s and Wachendorf’s communities get together to “rescue” food from the Iowa Events Center, repackage it into individual meals and split the food evenly between the two communities’ food closets. Gillman says these meals are especially important for consumers on the go, “like many of our houseless friends,” who can utilize the microwave at the nearby gas station to enjoy a warm meal free of charge.
Gillman says that churches are partnering with their communities to do all they can but “Des Moines is getting hungrier and hungrier.” 
“I see all these comments on social media saying ‘the churches will take care of it, the churches will take care of the people,’ and we are doing the best that we can now but we don’t have the infrastructure to take care of these needs that keep popping up and popping up,” Gillman said.  
She encourages every church in a metro area to have a community fridge because “it is the best way neighbors can share their gifts and provisions with one another,” but also it allows parishioners “to meet each other.” She says the space created by the community fridge has led to her meeting many of the local families and creating space for neighbors to “hang out.” 
Concerns about health care
Another exacerbating issue for Gillman is that many of the individuals reliant on the churches’ feeding programs are members of the “sandwich generation,” meaning they are taking care of both young children and adults whom they can’t afford to put into a nursing facility. 
She also said she feels “very afraid,” that these health care cuts may cause closures to nursing homes and rural hospitals. She is also “worried” about the fact that Iowa is an OB-GYN desert and that pregnant mothers may not be able to get the care they need.
“Medicaid is not full of people who are trying to game the system, it’s full of people who are hoping to someday not need Medicaid,” said Monnet “The structure of our laws and the structure for exemption and our minimum wage laws and other employment laws are such that somebody can be working full time and still not afford their own insurance.”
Monnet presides over all Episcopal churches in the state of Iowa. She expressed concerns that people will lose their medical coverage as a result of “onerous documenting requirements.” She said that the U.S. is looking at Medicaid policy backwards by saying “the only people who deserve healthcare are the ones who can earn it somehow,” rather than fostering a healthy society through providing health care to those in need. 
“If I look at Jesus and I look at what he did, during his lifetime, he healed whoever came to him. It didn’t matter if they were rich or poor, it didn’t matter if they were from the immediate community or far away,” Monnet said. “People would bring him people from all over the place and he would heal them because health is important to God.”

Harold Pope at the legislative session in March 2025. Pope annouced his candidacy for lieutenant governor on Tuesday, July 14, 2025. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico Sen. Harold Pope announced Monday his entry to seek the Democratic nomination in 2026 for the state’s second-highest executive position: lieutenant governor.
Voters reelected Pope to a second term in November to represent Albuquerque’s far northwest side, having won his first term in 2021.
Pope told Source NM in a call that he was proud of his legislative efforts, but said federal cuts to Medicaid, food benefits, educational funding and environmental deregulation will have wide-ranging impacts to New Mexicans.
“I just feel like I can do more in the executive position of lieutenant governor working for the governor full time,” Pope said. “I think, more importantly, it’s having someone at the table on the fourth floor being a voice for New Mexicans, and that’s really what I want to be.”
The lieutenant governor holds executive and legislative roles. The position ranks second-in-command and stands in for governors during absences. The lieutenant governor also serves as president of the New Mexico State Senate, overseeing the body’s business during the legislative session and determining issues of decorum or rules. The state’s Constitution grants the lieutenant governor tie-breaker vote power in the Senate.
Pope, who retired from the U.S. Air Force as a captain in 2018, has a background in biochemistry. He also has three master’s degrees (business administration from the University of New Mexico; operational leadership at the Air Force Air Command and Staff College; and pharmaceutical chemistry from the University of Florida) and announced in January he’s seeking a doctorate in education at Vanderbilt University.
Pope said his lived experience of having to use federal aid programs in his childhood and his time in the military offers a perspective that can speak to the importance of the programs.
“Quite frankly, we’re in a fight for our states,” he said.
Pope is the third Democratic candidate registered with the Secretary of State’s Office for the June 2, 2026 Democratic primary election, joining  current Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard, who is termed-out of that position; and Jackie Onsuarez, a nuclear waste engineer and Village Councilor from Loving, New Mexico.
One Republican candidate has also filed paperwork for the position: Manuel Lardizabal, a former candidate for the New Mexico Senate. Statewide candidates have until Feb. 2, 2026 to file to get on the ballot.
Pope enters the campaign with a little more than  $10,000 transferred from his Senate account, according to campaign finance documents. Pope said he was unaware of a $3,100 fine listed by the Secretary of State’s office for an outstanding filing, and said he had turned in the paperwork.
Garcia Richard’s cash balance was a little over $32,000, according to April filings, and neither Onsuarez nor Lardizabal have recorded any contributions or expenditures yet.
Following the primary, the winning governor and lieutenant governor candidates for each party will run on the same ticket during the Nov. 4, 2026 general election.
So far, three Democratic candidates have announced their bid for governor: Deb Haaland, the former U.S. Secretary of the interior and congresswomen; Sam Bregman, the 2nd Judicial District District attorney; and Ken Miyagashima, the former mayor of Las Cruces. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is term-limited from running again.
In the Running: Who’s in, who’s out for the 2026 NM governor race

Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull is the only declared Republican candidate for mayor. Several others have filed paperwork while weighing campaigns, including: Duke Rodriguez, CEO of Ultra Heath Cannabis and a former cabinet secretary for former Republican Gov. Gary Johnson; Brian Cillessen, a 53- year-old Farmington resident, veteran and hunting show host; and Las Cruces-based fitness instructor, Belinda Robertson.
There’s one decline-to-state candidate: Gene Pettit, a nondenominational pastor in Radium Springs.
Pope said he would not endorse any of the three Democratic candidates in the gubernatorial race. “At the end of the day, the voters are going to have to make that selection, and whoever that is, I believe I will make the Democratic ticket stronger as the candidate,” he said.

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.
Two years ago, Nicolle Orozco Forero walked into an in-home day care in Seattle, Washington, looking for a job. She was barely 22, a whole five feet tall — if that. But she was calm, focused. Her presence struck the owner, Stephanie Wishon, because it’s not easy to find qualified staff who can work with children with disabilities.
Orozco Forero had experience working with kids who had autism back in Colombia, so Wishon had her come in for a trial run and hired her after the first day. The children, who needed someone who had love and care to give in abundance, gravitated toward her. She was good at the hardest stuff. She changed diapers and outfits the moment they were soiled. She was vigilant; her kids stayed pristine. And she got them to do the things they wouldn’t do for other people, like say “ah” when it was time to get their teeth brushed or sit still long enough for her to twist a braid down their back.
Some people just have that way about them.
And people like Orozco Forero are exceptionally rare. Already, the staffing shortage in child care is near crisis levels. It’s far worse for children with disabilities — about a third of those families say they face significant difficulty finding care for their kids, partly because there are too few people with the ability, expertise or desire to work with their children. Immigrant women like Orozco Forero have been helping to fill that void. They now make up 20 percent of all child care workers.
At home, Orozco Forero was also caring for her own young boys, one of whom started to show symptoms of a serious illness over the past two years that doctors have not yet been able to diagnose. She took some time off to care for him last year, before returning to the kids at Wishon’s day care.
Her work has kept an already precarious safety net together. Without women like Orozco Forero, families who have nowhere else to turn for care have to make difficult decisions about how to survive and keep their children safe. Without her, the safety net snaps.
And that’s exactly what happened on June 18, the day she was detained.
It was supposed to be a routine meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Orozco Forero and her husband had been to all their monthly meetings for the past year and change, since their asylum charge was denied in April 2024.
The family — Orozco Forero; her husband, Juan Sebastian Moreno Acosta; and their two sons, Juan David, 7, and Daniel, 5 — fled Colombia two years ago. Moreno Acosta, a street vendor, had been persecuted by gangs who target vendors for money.
After arriving in the United States, they sought the help of a lawyer with their asylum claim, but when they couldn’t pay his full fee ahead of their hearing, he pulled out. They represented themselves in court and lost the case. With no knowledge of the U.S. court system, they didn’t know they had 30 days to appeal the ruling, either. Ever since, ICE has been monitoring them, requiring they wear a wrist tracker and meet with an immigration officer once a month, sometimes more, according to a family member. (The 19th is not naming the family member to protect their identity.) It’s unclear why ICE has allowed them to stay in the country all this time, though it’s not necessarily uncommon; ICE typically prioritized immigrants with felonies for deportation.
Orozco Forero had seen the reports of undocumented immigrants being rounded up at their immigration appointments. President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort has led to the detention of about 30,000 migrants with no criminal record, like Orozco Forero, who now make up about half of those detained. Her husband does have a misdemeanor reckless driving conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol on his record, but he completed a court-mandated alcohol course for that and has no other convictions.
Still, Orozco Forero wasn’t worried when she headed to her appointment on the morning of June 18. If ICE planned to detain her, Orozco Forero thought, they would have asked her to come with the boys, right?
And she had been doing everything right: She’d gone to all her appointments, taken documentation to show she was going to school at Green River Community College taking courses in English and early childhood education. She had completed a child care internship that trained her to open her own licensed in-home day care. Her licensure approval was set to arrive any moment, likely that same week, and the day care was just about ready to go.
But that morning, her family was still wary, asking her to share her location just in case.
Shortly after 10 a.m., Orozco Forero texted her family member: “They are going to deport us”
“Nicolle what happened? Nicolle answer me,” they texted back. “What do I do?”
“I can’t speak I feel like I’m going to faint,” Orozco Forero replied. And then: “I’m sorry it wasn’t what we expected.”
Two-and-a-half hours west, on the coast of Washington in a town called Southbend, Wishon was frantic. Orozco Forero had texted her, too. ICE was asking for the boys.
In two years, Wishon had grown incredibly close to Orozco Forero, who had cared for her own kids. After her family moved to the coast, Wishon rented out her house in Seattle to Orozco Forero, whose boys were excited to have a home with a yard.
Wishon’s husband, Gabriel, hopped into his truck and headed to Seattle. Wishon, meanwhile, got on the phone with the Orozco Forero family’s ICE agent and every lawyer she could. They were going to take them into detention at a facility 2,200 miles away in Texas, a facility that was reopened earlier this year by the Trump administration to detain families. Wishon wanted to find a lawyer who could stop the deportation order, and she wanted to make sure the boys would be reunited with their parents if they took them to meet the ICE agent.

And that was especially important, not just because they were young children, but because Juan David is still sick.
For the past year, he’s been seeking treatment at Seattle Children’s Hospital for an illness that is turning his urine muddy. So far, doctors have determined he’s losing red blood cells and protein through his urine, indicating a possible kidney issue, but they haven’t yet zeroed in on what is causing the problem. They likely need a kidney biopsy to be sure.
“Given the complexity of his case, it is essential that Juan remain in the United States for continued testing and treatment,” his nephrologist Jordan Symons wrote in a March letter to ICE. “We kindly request that you consider this medical necessity in your review of his immigration status and grant him the ability to stay in the United States until his treatment and evaluation are completed.”
Juan David’s care team has been monitoring him closely to ensure his red blood cell and protein levels never drop too low. His condition could become serious quickly.
“You can die from that,” said Sarah Kasnick, a physician’s assistant who is familiar with his case. Kasnick is also a foster parent, and Orozco Forero provided care for her family.
When Gabriel Wishon arrived to pick up the boys, they were confused and disoriented. Where were their parents? Why was everyone crying? They didn’t want to go to Colombia, they told him on the drive. They wanted to stay in the United States.
Around 5:30 p.m. that evening, he met with the ICE agent, who had waited past her work hours for them to arrive.
“Bye boys, you are going to see your parents right now. They are right inside,” Wishon told them. He watched them walk in carrying two stuffed animals, a Super Mario doll and Chase, the popular cartoon dog dressed as a police officer.
The families Orozco Forero cares for are now in a free fall.
Jessica Cocson, whose son has been in Orozco Forero’s care for more than a year, described her in a character letter to ICE as a “blessing to us in ways I struggle to fully express.”
Orozco Forero and her husband “support working families, provide quality childcare, and demonstrate compassion and commitment every day,” Cocson wrote. “It is heartbreaking to think that someone who gives so much and asks so little could be forced to leave.”
Tamia Riley, whose two sons with autism were also in Orozco Forero’s care, said losing her was like watching “a father walking out the door.”
“These people, these day care providers, sitters, they are a form of family members for me and my children,” Riley said.
Now, the day care she was set to open lays empty. Inside, the walls are plastered with posters listing colors and sight words. There are cushioned mats on the floor and play stations. Tables with tiny chairs. A tall pink dollhouse. High chairs and a pack and play for the babies. Outside, two play houses, a ball pit, toys to ride on and little picnic tables set across an artificial turf. But no children to enjoy any of it.
Big Dreams Day Care she was going to call it, for the dreams she wanted the kids in her care to strive for, and the ones that were finally coming to fruition for her.
Orozco Forero’s detention has rattled child care workers across the country. In Texas, workers represented by the Service Employees International Union have been rallying in her name. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, spoke in support of the family’s release at a rally on June 29 in San Antonio. And a group of union workers is attempting to deliver supplies to the family. It’s an effort Orozco Forero knows little about; she only has limited communication with those on the outside.
Tricia Schroeder, the president of the Seattle-based SEIU chapter that represents care workers, said that, for years unions like hers have been working to improve quality, access and affordability in child care, a system in such deep crisis it’s been called by the Treasury Department “a textbook example of a broken market.”
Immigrant women like Orozco Forero were part of that effort to improve access, doing jobs few Americans want to take on.
“Detaining child care providers, especially those who care for kids with special needs, just deepens the crisis in early learning,” Schroeder said.

Orozco Forero was also the connective tissue that kept families employed. Her loss has rippled across industries.
Kasnick, the foster parent, said one of the children in her care had been tentatively set to start at Orozco Forero’s day care as soon as it opened. Orozco Forero had been the only provider who would take the child, who has autism and is nonverbal.
Orozco Forero had cared for the girl at Wishon’s day care as if she was her own, even taking her in once when the child’s care had fallen through and no foster family in the entire county would take her in because of the complexity of her needs. The girl arrived at Orozco Forero’s house at midnight on a weekend “with no clothing, toys, medication or any of her belongings … this did not [deter] Nicolle and Sebastian instead they immediately went and purchased all the things” the child needed, a social worker wrote in a letter to ICE. Kasnick said Orozco Forero was even considering becoming a foster parent.
Without her, Kasnick is out of options: She quit her job as a physician’s assistant to care for the child after Orozco Forero was detained.
“There are now 44 patients a day who don’t have anyone to provide their health care, and I can’t go to work because Nicolle’s day care didn’t open,” Kasnick said.
In the weeks since, Kasnick has had an overwhelming feeling of helplessness, she said. How could this happen to someone who gave back so much?
“The security of knowing that you can be in your home one day and in a prison the next week, and you didn’t do anything except exist?” she said. “It makes you feel like there’s no good left in the world.”
Orozco Forero’s family was in ICE detention for nearly a month awaiting a bond hearing they hoped could buy them time in the United States. Orozco Forero and the boys were together; her husband was in the same facility but separated from them.
Juan David wasn’t eating much. It took three weeks for him to receive medical care, Orozco Forero told her attorney, James Costo.
Costo had been working to get the details of why ICE allowed the family to stay in the country with monitoring after they lost their asylum case last year. There has been an order for their deportation since then, but ICE never attempted to deport them until the Trump administration ramped up efforts. The number of immigrants without criminal convictions who have been detained has doubled since May.
The process to fight an asylum claim and appeal a denial is complicated — there are court deadlines, documents that need to be submitted and translated.
“They think maybe they can do it themselves and go in and say what happened but they are not understanding the whole legal process,” Costo said. “The system isn’t made for things to be easy.”
Costo was hopeful a judge will allow them to stay in the country temporarily as Juan David seeks care. They have almost no family left in Colombia, and no way to obtain care for him there, their family said.
But on Thursday, Wishon got word that the family had been deported. The family arrived distraught at the home of the only close family they have in Bogotá, the capital.
Daniel, Orozco Forero’s youngest son, sent Wishon a voice message: “Good evening Stephanie, um, we are good. My mommy is very sad,” his little voice tells her.”Thank you for everything you have done for us. God bless you.”
A GoFundMe she set up will be used toward supporting the family as they try to transition to life in Colombia and seek care for Juan David.
A collection of support letters they hoped would move a judge somewhere to hear their case now only remain as chronicles of their impact. In the letters, Juan David’s first grade teachers call him an exceptional student who went from one of the lowest reading levels in the class — 10 words a minute — to one of the highest at 70 words a minute.
“He shows the qualities of a model citizen at a young age — dependable, ethical, and hard-working,” wrote his teacher, Carla Trujillo.
They were all on their way to shaping a better life, Wishon wrote in hers. The couple “worked tirelessly to build a better life for their children and to open their own licensed child care business. In all my years of employing and mentoring caregivers, I have rarely met a couple as responsible, driven, and capable as Nicolle and Sebastian.”
“This family is not a threat,” she concluded. “They are an asset.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/childcare-detention01-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 17:09:48.351263

The elections panel’s unanimous vote confirms the preliminary outcome of the special Democratic primary, which saw North Providence Town Councilor Stefano Famiglietti triumph over his three opponents with a decisive 68% percent of the vote — more than 52 percentage points ahead of second-place finisher, Marcia Ranglin-Vassell. 
Considered the frontrunner in the primary, Famiglietti served on the North Providence Town Council since 2018, receiving endorsements from the Senate District 4 Democratic Committee, the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone. He will now face the sole Republican candidate, Alexander Asermely, in an Aug. 5 general election.
Asermely, 39, a lawyer, is a first-time candidate for elected office and is backed by the Rhode Island Republican Party. 
The special election fills the seat left open by Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who died in April. Whoever wins the upcoming Aug. 5 general election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026, with a $19,817 annual salary.
There are 22,214 registered voters in the district, which spans North Providence and a section of northern Providence. A majority of them, roughly 10,000, are registered Democrats, while another 9,700 are unaffiliated, with the remainder registered as Republicans, according to data from the Rhode Island Department of State. Registered Republicans had to disaffiliate in order to vote in the July 8 Democratic primary under state election rules.
Just over half of the 2,445 voters who participated in the primary cast ballots on primary day at one of four designated polling places. The other half were divided equally between early voting at city or town hall, and mail ballots.
Ranglin-Vassell, a former state representative and Providence Public Schools teacher, received more than 15% of the vote overall, but more than half of the support from voters at the sole Providence polling place.  Famiglietti, 33, a lawyer,  led in all three North Providence polling places with 60-80% of the votes, according to official election results.
Lenny Cioe, 66, a nurse, finished third with 11.5% of votes. Manny Taveras, 40, brother of former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, received less than 5% of votes. 
Early voting for the special general election starts Wednesday and runs through Monday, Aug. 4, with weekday hours for district voters at Providence City Hall and North Providence Town Hall. More information is available on the Rhode Island Department of State website. 
Board of Elections Chairperson Jennie Johnson and members Randall Jackvony and Michael Connors were absent from the meeting Tuesday.

(Courtesy of the Utah State Department of Corrections)Utah Department of Corrections officials say they’ll be ready to carry out the upcoming execution of death row inmate Ralph Menzies that’s currently scheduled to take place shortly after midnight on Sept. 5. 
A Utah judge signed Menzies’ death warrant last week, setting the date for the 67-year-old man with dementia to die by firing squad. That is, barring any other legal hurdles.  
Capital punishment is “one of the most consequential duties any state agency or department is called upon to fulfill, and our department stands ready to do just that,” Jared Garcia, executive director of the Utah Department of Corrections, told reporters from the department’s training academy in Draper.
“We will carry out the statutory requirements in a professional and respectful manner,” Garcia said, adding that state officials have “now officially started” to prepare. 
It’s been less than a year since Utah’s last execution, when state officials put death row inmate Taberon Honie to death by lethal injection on Aug. 7. Now, state officials are gearing up to do it again — but this time with .30 caliber rifles. 
Judge sets date for Ralph Menzies to die by firing squad as attorneys say his dementia is worsening

“Because we went through this last year, we’ve confirmed our processes at (the new state prison in Salt Lake City), and we feel very comfortable in being able to see this through in a very similar fashion,” Garcia said. “The method will be different, as this will be a firing squad execution as opposed to lethal injection, but again we are confident in our planning and process (from) last year, and we’ll be able to adjust the logistics.” 
Menzies, when he was sentenced to death more than 40 years ago for the murder of Maurine Hunsaker, chose to die by firing squad. Menzies was convicted of the murder in 1988, after he kidnapped Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk, and took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed. 
Though a date has been set, Menzies’ attorneys are still pursuing appeals. A judge later this month will decide whether he should undergo another mental evaluation before the execution. Menzies’ attorneys argue his dementia has worsened since he was last evaluated about a year ago. Based on those reports, the judge determined last month that Menzies did have cognitive shortcomings but did not meet the high bar to be deemed incompetent.
Both state and federal law require that death row inmates have an understanding of why they’re being executed. 
Menzies’ attorneys argue he can no longer articulate the state’s reasoning for pursuing the death penalty and even has trouble with basic tasks like getting his food, getting dressed and cleaning his cell. State attorneys, however, argue Menzies’ execution should be allowed to proceed. Daniel Boyer, who represented the state last week, told reporters he doesn’t think there’s enough in the Menzies’ petition to warrant another evaluation.

Last week, Menzies’ attorney Eric Zuckerman called the notion of executing his client “inhumane.”
“He’s tethered to a wheelchair and an oxygen tank. And he’s not competent. This has gotten worse over the past year and we remain hopeful that the courts or the clemency board will recognize the inhumanity of taking a man like him into the death chair, taking him out of his wheelchair, and executing him,” Zuckerman said outside the courtroom. “It’s wrong and Utah can do better.” 
But Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, applauded the judge’s decision to sign the death warrant Wednesday, telling reporters he was feeling “overwhelmed” and “very happy.” 
“His life will be over in mere seconds,” Hunsaker said when asked how he’s preparing for the execution. “My mom, we don’t know how long she stood and suffered in that grove, how long she bled to death and how she felt.” 
Why is Menzies set to be executed by firing squad?
In Utah, death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 had a choice between lethal injection or firing squad. Menzies, when he was sentenced to death, chose the firing squad. For those sentenced after 2004, the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.
In the courtroom in 1988, when asked how he preferred to die after he was sentenced to death, the Deseret News reported: “Menzies replied loudly: ‘Shoot me.’”
Though it’s been less than 12 months since Utah’s last execution, it’s been more than 15 years since Utah officials carried out an execution by firing squad. 
Ronnie Lee Gardner was the last inmate to be executed by firing squad in Utah, on June 18, 2010. Gardner was convicted of murder in 1985 for shooting Michael Burdell, an attorney, and wounding Nick Kirk, a bailiff, in a failed attempt to escape from court, where he was already facing another murder charge.

(Courtesy of the Utah State Department of Corrections)Randy Gardner, who witnessed his brother’s firing squad execution, has become a vocal advocate against the death penalty, saying witnessing his brother being killed by firing squad traumatized him. 
Randy Gardner was among about two dozen protesters who came to the “free speech zone” about two miles south of Utah’s prison last August when state officials executed Honie by lethal injection.
Utah News Dispatch was among the media witnesses for Honie’s execution. The witnesses agreed the death was quiet, with no outward signs of suffering.
According to media witness accounts of Ronnie Lee Gardner’s execution, he was pronounced dead after one volley of bullets, two minutes after the shots were fired. In those two minutes, reporters said Ronnie Lee Gardner’s left hand clenched into a fist, leaving some media members to wonder briefly whether his execution would require a second volley, which it didn’t. 
It’s been over 15 years since Utah’s last firing squad execution. Will the state be prepared?
Garcia said state officials “absolutely feel like we’re prepared to carry out this type of execution through a firing squad.” 
“The logistics are just a little bit different on how we locate firing squad members, we’re just getting started with that process,” Garcia said. 
He added that Menzies’ execution is set to take place in the same execution chamber where Honie was put to death, but the difference is rather than being strapped to a gurney for a lethal injection, Menzies will be tied down to a chair. 
Cost of Utah’s execution of Taberon Honie topped $288K, not including legal expenses

State officials say they plan to largely adhere to the same protocol as that 2010 execution, with the only difference being that it will take place at the execution chamber in the new Utah State Correctional Facility, located in Salt Lake City’s remote northwest corner. That facility replaced the now-demolished Utah State Prison in Draper in 2022. 
For a firing squad execution, Utah law requires the executive director of the Utah Department of Corrections or a designee to select a “five-person firing squad of peace officers.” 
When asked how those firing squad members will be recruited, Garcia said “that’s still yet to be determined. We’re still working through that.” 
Pressed on whether state officials will be establishing a protocol for that, Garcia said, “Yes, we definitely want to make sure that they are people that are, first of all, mentally prepared to participate in this type of assignment.” 
“As you can imagine, it shouldn’t be taken lightly,” he said, adding that state officials “want to make sure that they are skilled” marksmen. 
“I want to make sure that this … goes through in a professional and dignified way, and that we do it right,” Garcia said. 
Utah’s firing squad protocol
According to the Utah Department of Correction’s 2010 execution protocol, “persons selected for the firing squad shall be POST certified peace officers. Selected peace officers will be required to demonstrate proficiency with weapons designated to carry out the execution.” 
Proficiency, the protocol says, must be shown by firing .30 caliber weapons “at a minimum of 21 feet, accurately hitting the target of the same dimension as that which will be attached to the condemned.” 
The protocol calls for an “aiming point or target to be placed over the condemned inmate’s heart.” 
“During the proficiency test, failure to accurately hit the specified target with one round from each weapon fired shall disqualify the officer,” the protocol says. 
State officials will keep the shooters’ identities secret. The firing squad protocol requires that of the five weapons used for the execution, four will be loaded with two live rounds while one will be loaded with two blank rounds. 
“Care shall be taken to preclude any knowledge by the members of the firing squad of who is issued the weapon with two blank cartridges,” the protocol says.
In addition to that five-person execution team, the protocol also requires that “two alternates and a team leader shall be chosen.” The alternates “shall be selected to replace any member(s) of the firing squad who are unable to discharge their required functions.” 
The protocol also requires that a “minimum of three rehearsals and practices shall be conducted to carry out an execution in a timely fashion maintaining the necessary security.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For the execution, the protocol requires “a designated execution team member” to “start a stopwatch once the first volley has been fired.” If, after the first rounds are fired, the death row inmate appears to be unconscious, the protocol requires the warden to “wait a maximum of three minutes after the first volley and then call for the physician to check the vital signs of the condemned.” 
“If, after a maximum of 10 minutes from the first volley, the inmate is unconscious but alive, the Warden shall direct the physician to make a final check on the condemned vital signs,” the protocol says. If the inmate is found to still be alive, the protocol directs the executive director or a designee to order the firing squad team leader to ready the team for a second volley. 
If, after the first round of bullets, the inmate “is obviously conscious,” the protocol requires the executive director to “instruct the firing squad team leader to immediately prepare the weapons to fire again.” 
The protocol calls for those procedures to be repeated until “no vital signs are detected” and the physician certifies the death.

In 2020, the city of Jackson settled its lawsuit with the German company over years of faulty metering for water services. While about a third of the $90 million went to legal fees, city officials couldn’t immediately say where the rest of those funds went during a status conference Monday. 
City Attorney Drew Martin said he was working to comply with a subpoena Wingate issued last week looking for an accounting of the settlement dollars, adding that he would have those details within a day or two. While he couldn’t say for sure where the money went, Martin said the city spent about $50 million within a few months after the settlement, and that there was $8 million remaining as of 2022.

Ted Henifin, who runs JXN Water and first proposed the rate increase in February, said the increase would still be necessary even if the utility received all the money from the Siemens settlement. He said the utility’s day-to-day management is operating at a deficit, and that the $60 million from the settlement — what Jackson received after paying its lawyers — would only cover losses for the next two years. 
Henifin added that he’s asking the federal government to move around its funding to the city so he can spend more of it on operations and management. Without a boost to JXN Water’s finances, he said the utility would have to stop paying its contractors.    
Wingate inquired about the settlement money during a two-day status conference last month. Henifin told the judge he had no idea what the city did with the funds. Wingate explained Monday that he wanted to make sure he was aware of all possible funding for JXN Water before approving a second rate increase in as many years. 
It’s unclear how soon he’ll decide. In addition to Jackson officials, Wingate issued the subpoena on July 9 to the state and federal government as well as four different law firms. The subpoena gives the parties 30 days to produce any information on where the settlement funds went.
The judge also brought up the city’s history with shutting off nonpaying customers. Martin explained that the city, under then Mayor Tony Yarber, agreed to pause shutoffs for customers who had issues with Siemens’ water meters. Jackson prepared to bring back shutoffs in 2019, he said, but put them on hold again during the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100123/3X0A3827-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-14 17:09:48.351263

It symbolizes opening the door to happiness, unity and prosperity. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)DE SOTO — Hundreds from around the world gathered Monday to celebrate the grand opening of the Panasonic electric vehicle battery plant in De Soto and tour the 4.7 million-square-foot facility that claims the tag of the state’s biggest economic development project ever.
The Japanese ambassador to the United States, Panasonic leaders, and local, regional and national elected officials praised the partnership required to bring the project to fruition. Panasonic is expected to invest $4 billion in the plant, and the Kansas Department of Commerce estimates it will bring $2.5 billion to the state’s economy annually.
The state offered $829 million in incentives to Panasonic through the Attracting Powerful Economic Expansion Act, or APEX.
“Just two and a half years ago, November 22, we stood on this very ground,” said Allan Swan, president and chief operating officer of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America. “At that point, it was just a big open field, but we had a whole vision to build a world-class facility that would power the future of clean transportation, create thousands of jobs, new high-quality jobs, and serve as the catalyst for economic growth in Kansas and across the region.”
“Today,” he said, “that vision is a reality.”
One week ago, the first production line began operating, and it will take three to four months for it to achieve full capacity, Swan said after the ceremony.
By early January, Swan said, three additional lines will be operating and construction will begin on a second wing of the building, which is expected to house an additional four lines in about 18 months.
Currently, the plant makes about 50,000 batteries per day — at a rate of about 70 per second — and employs 1,100 people, Swan said. It is expected to employ 4,000 people when at full capacity.
Reports by international media that decreased Tesla sales will delay the move to full capacity are just part of being in a new business, Swan said.
“We’re in a brand new industry,” he said. “That industry is going to ebb and flow a little bit as she grows, and she will grow, and we’re clearly growing in one direction. It’s not going to change. The beauty of Kansas is we can build these lines out. We’ve got customers that want them, so we should be in a good place.”
Batteries won’t begin to ship out to customers for three or four weeks because of rigorous safety and quality testing, Swan said.

The marketplace
Customers who will use the electric vehicle batteries in their products were in attendance, including representatives from Lucid Motors, Toyota, Harbinger Motors and Tesla. Nick Twork, spokesman for Lucid, said they were pleased to see a new plant built. 
“It’s really great because obviously it allows us to have a domestic supply chain for battery cells,” he said. “This facility will start supplying us next year, and we’ll ship batteries to our factory in Arizona.”
Upcoming changes to U.S. policies, like eliminating tax credits for buying electric cars, aren’t really something that concerns Lucid, Twork said.
“As long as it’s a level playing field, that’s the most important thing,” he said. “Obviously that’s going to affect the marketplace, so we’ll adapt as necessary. We’re an agile business, and we’ll do what it takes.”
Twork said he wasn’t willing to comment on any acrimony the public is feeling about Tesla products and reports the company’s sales are down.
“From our standpoint, we’ve had six consecutive quarters of record growth for the company,” he said. “We keep selling more vehicles, so more and more customers are finding out about
what Lucid has to offer.”

Supply chains
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran spoke at the ceremony and afterward said trade negotiations need to take place to get rid of barriers that keep U.S. products out of international markets.
“But as I’ve indicated to the ambassador today, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that the outcome of those conversations between Japan and the United States are beneficial to both countries,” Moran said.
The federal government wants supply chains brought home, he said.
“This is an example of where business that was being done outside the United States will now be done in the United States,” he said of the Panasonic plant.
Swan said Panasonic is working to bring more suppliers to locate in the United States. Three already have space in the De Soto plant.
“It’s an ongoing process, and we’ll keep working with our suppliers who already exist to see whether we can get them here to the United States, or find another way of creating a stronger supply chain,” Swan said.
There are still 6,000 acres near the plant that could be used for expansion or where suppliers could build. Swan said the company would like to see that developed and is working with the state of Kansas to bring suppliers “as close as possible.”
Swan praised the De Soto plant as the largest plant his company has built with top-of-the-line manufacturing capabilities.
“We built the first one with Tesla over in Nevada, so that’s their factory. This is our factory,” he said. “We’ve redesigned it to make it quite more productive. There is roughly 10% less machinery here and a lot more automation, so that’s where the innovation comes in. The lines here are the fastest lines that we’ve ever had.”
The labor-saving production lines are expected to achieve approximately 20% higher productivity compared to the Nevada factory, a press release said.

Workforce training
All of those who spoke Monday highlighted the partnerships that it took to make such a large project successful. Speakers repeatedly mentioned the collaboration with local community colleges to help the company train the workforce it needs.
Greg Mosier, president of the Kansas City Kansas Community College, said new programs at the school train Panasonic’s entry level skilled maintenance technicians and advanced engineering technicians.
The program is a mix of schooling at the community college and working at the Panasonic plant, he said.
“We developed it in partnership with Panasonic, and then it’s also 16 credit hours, so they get a college certificate with it as well,” Mosier said. “It’s an apprenticeship model, so they are on the regular 16-week schedule. They do two days at the college, three days at the factory.”
In response to a Panasonic request, the community college was able to condense the program to eight weeks, he said. After completing the course and working full time at Panasonic, Mosier said, students are earning $50,000 to $60,000 per year.

Japanese investment
The investments Panasonic is making in Kansas will strengthen the state’s economy and do much more, said Yasuaki Takamoto, CEO of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America.
“What happens here is just the first step in building a stable and secure domestic supply chain, one that’s becoming a reality thanks to our ongoing investment and partnership,” he said. “We are supporting domestic production with critical EV components, strengthening North America’s manufacturing ecosystems and helping America maintain its competitive edge.”
Takamoto said that selecting Kansas for the plant meant choosing the community and the workforce they believed in.
“Since then, we built relationships that will last for years to come,” he said.
Japanese ambassador Shigeo Yamada highlighted the strong relationship between the United States and Japan, saying Japan has been the strongest investor in the United States in the past 50 years and has created 1 million jobs.
“Japanese investment in this country is about much more than just dollars and cents,” he said. “By working hand-in-hand with local communities, Japanese companies are building enduring ties and a sense of trust with their peoples. These personal ties — connections — form the very foundation on which the bilateral relationship is built and allowing us to collaborate, not just as allies, but as trusted friends.”

According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

Two Minnesota counties are among dozens of cities and counties suing over Trump administration threats to tie federal funding for housing and other programs to local policy on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; and abortion. (Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Twenty-eight cities and counties including Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and Rochester, New York, joined a lawsuit July 10 challenging Trump administration attempts to withhold federal funds because of local policies on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; gender equity; and abortion access.
Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.”
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Attorney General Keith Ellison announced Monday that he’s suing the Trump administration after it froze funding for six U.S. Department of Education programs. The freeze could cost Minnesota about $70 million in funding annually — 11.4% of the total Department of Education funding the state is expected to receive, according to the Learning Policy Institute, 
“Donald Trump’s Department of Education is pulling the rug out from under Minnesota students by cutting school funding without warning and right before the start of the school year, and they are violating the law by doing so,” Ellison said in a press release.
Ellison has joined a coalition of 22 other attorneys general and two governors. The lawsuit argues that Congress, not the executive branch, has the power to appropriate funds and that withholding the money violates federal statutes.
The Department of Education told state agencies on June 30 that it did not plan to release the funds — the day before an initial 25% of the money is usually paid out to states. According to the suit, the department said it was withholding funds to “review” the programs’ compliance with the “President’s priorities.”
With the school year less than two months away, the Legislature and local school boards had already made budgets and staffing plans under the assumption that the grants would be allocated as normal. If Minnesota seeks to backfill the missing federal money, that could exacerbate a projected deficit. 
The funding freeze will impact summer school and afterschool programs, teacher training and English learner programs, among other services.
Federal money is a relatively small share of Minnesota education budgets: state funding makes up 64% of education spending in Minnesota, with federal funding providing 8%, and the balance made up by local funding.
Still, educators said they would resist the Trump’s administration’s actions.
“This is not just a budget cut – it’s an assault on the rule of law and our commitment to every child’s right to a quality education,” Monica Byron, president of Education Minnesota, said in a statement on July 1. “Trump is stealing money from classrooms to pay for more tax breaks for billionaires, and Minnesota students will pay the price.”

In a separate case, the board alleged that a Walgreens store located in Marshalltown, identified in federal records as the store at 5 E. Anson St., dispensed a prescription medication on March 27, 2023, for guanfacine, a drug often used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, for a minor. In filling the prescription, the store mistakenly included one capsule of propranolol, a beta-blocker often used to treat high blood pressure, in the bottle.
The board alleges the store’s quality control records related to the error failed to include the root cause of the incident, the name of the individual that analyzed the event, or the date it was created.
The store was charged with dispensing an incorrect prescription and failing to have completed a continuous quality improvement report of the incident. To resolve the matter, the store agreed to accept a warning and pay a $2,000 civil penalty.
In a third Board of Pharmacy case, the board has alleged that a Walgreens store in North Liberty, identified in federal records as the store at 625 Pacha Parkway, on Feb. 27, 2023, dispensed “liquid infant vitamin drops” that had expired three weeks earlier. The board alleges the store’s quality control records related to the error failed to include a detailed description of the event or the cause of the error.
The store was charged with dispensing an incorrect prescription and failing to have completed a continuous quality improvement report of the incident. To resolve the matter, the store agreed to accept a warning and pay a $2,000 civil penalty.
The Board of Pharmacy has not disclosed whether any patients were adversely affected by the errors.

(Photo by Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Mount Hope Bridge will be closed to traffic in both directions for four days next month for a $1 million repaving operation, the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (RITBA) has announced.
The 96-year old bridge linking Bristol and Portsmouth over Mount Hope Bay will be closed to all traffic beginning at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Aug. 14, and will reopen at 5 a.m. Monday, Aug. 18. But if there is any severe weather in the forecast, the project will be rescheduled for a weekend in September, officials said.
Emergency vehicles will not be permitted to cross during the closure, but RITBA has been coordinating with officials in Bristol and Portsmouth about detours.
“We appreciate the public’s patience as we get this work done,” Lori Caron Silveira, RITBA’s executive director, said in a statement. “We know that everyone will welcome a smoother ride over the bridge and hope that the advance notice will help people make their plans to seek alternate routes for that weekend.”
Cumberland-based J.H. Lynch and Sons was awarded a $1.1 million contract by RITBA to smooth the roadway by milling it and applying an ultra-thin bonded overlay between the curbs. A copy of the contract was not immediately made available.
RITBA expects the new surface to last five years — coincidentally around the same time a contractor is expected to begin reconstructing the deck of the bridge, the Bristol Phoenix reported in May.
The state of the Mount Hope bridge has come into question — namely the corroded cables that hold up the roadway. RITBA spokesperson Cara Cromwell confirmed that dehumidification of the cables is a project that will also be scheduled in the future.
Inspection reports on the condition of the existing cables  are not being made public. RITBA declined to release a fall 2024 inspection report to WPRI-12, citing national security concerns, the station reported on June 24.
Cromwell told Rhode Island Current all four of the bridges RITBA operates are considered “essential infrastructure,” so their inspection reports fall under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Sensitive Security Information designation.
That means only the federal government can authorize the release of the reports. Cromwell said the Mount Hope Bridge was rated “fair” in the fall 2024 inspection report. 
“If the inspection had revealed any urgent issues, we would have been alerted immediately,” Cromwell said. “There were no significant findings.”
RITBA has asked the Department of Homeland Security to review inspection reports for the Mount Hope, Pell, Jamestown Verrazzano, and Sakoner River bridges to determine which, if any, portions can be made public. 
“We will not be able to make public any portion of the report until we hear back,” Cromwell said in an email. “In the meantime, if the inspection had revealed any urgent issues, we would have been alerted immediately.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Plans to develop one of New England’s largest battery storage facilities on a plot of land in Killingly have fallen through, according to documents submitted to the Connecticut Siting Council.
An attorney for the project, known as Windham Energy Center, notified the siting council in a letter last month that the developer had decided to withdraw its application to build the 325-megawatt facility. The decision came after town officials raised concerns about the proposed facility, particularly the risk of fire, and requested more information from developers.
The attorney, Ken Baldwin, said on Monday that he was not authorized to talk about the project and referred requests for comment to the Israel-based developer, Sunflower Sustainable Investments.
Representatives for that company did not responded to multiple requests for comment.
The company’s decision to withdraw its application was first reported by New London’s The Day newspaper.
It was not the first time developers had sought to use the property, which is located next to existing Eversource transmission lines, to supply power to the regional electric grid.
In 2016, Florida-based NTE Energy proposed building a natural gas-fired power plant on the same location. That plan drew intense criticism from environmental groups, with protests held both in Killingly and at the state Capitol in Hartford.
While the siting council gave its approval to that project in 2019, it continued to be a source of debate for several more years until federal regulators dealt a final blow to NTE’s efforts in 2022. Last year, Windham Energy Center’s developers filed their application to use the site as a battery storage facility.
According to Windham Energy’s application, the project would have cost an estimated $200 million and taken a little more than a year to build. The plans called for lithium-ion batteries housed in dozens of prefabricated storage containers, as well as an electrical substation connecting to the regional grid.
Almost from the start, however, the project faced difficulties due to the fact that NTE Energy continued to hold the certificate of approval from the siting council to develop the property for a power plant — despite having since gone out of business. In November, Baldwin filed a request with the siting council to reopen that approval process for the purpose of resolving the issue.
In the meantime, Killingly officials began to raise a number of concerns about the project in filings made with the siting council. Those concerns touched on noise and gases that could be emitted from the facility, as well as the potential for intense battery fires known as “thermal runaways.”
Local officials asked for the developers to provide more information and, in some cases, to alter their plans to address those concerns — such as through the construction of vegetation barriers. In January, Baldwin indicated that the company was willing to take additional steps to address some of the local concerns.
But before those issues were resolved, Baldwin sent the letter on June 3 withdrawing the application.
Melanie Bachman, the executive director of the siting council, said in her acknowledgment of that letter that Windham Energy would have to submit new applications should it seek to restart the approval process.
Representatives from Killingly, including Acting Town Manager Frances Conroy and Economic Development Director Jill St. Clair, were not available for comment on Monday.

(Photo: Ahmed Jallow)Attorney General Jeff Jackson announced Monday that North Carolina is suing the U.S. Department of Education over its freeze of $165 million in education funding the state, a decision expected to affect more than 1,000 positions and various school programs.
The lawsuit, which was joined by 24 other states, targets the federal government’s decision to withhold more than $6.8 billion nationwide in public school funding.
Jackson announced the lawsuit alongside State Superintendent Maurice “Mo” Green and State Board of Education Chair Eric Davis, warning that the cuts could disrupt after-school programs, mental health services and English language learning support just weeks before the new school year. 
“Congress created these programs and authorized this funding,” Jackson said at a news conference. “The Department of Education does not have the authority to now withhold those funds, certainly not the night before they were set to arrive.” 
“It was a three-sentence email [that] contained basically no detail, and simply said that ‘this money was going to be frozen until further notice,'” Jackson said. “Since then, they have been unwilling to answer our questions.
“If this is not addressed, the impacts will be severe and widespread.”
The lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction to unblock the frozen grants. 
Local school districts could face emergency measures such as hiring freezes or classroom consolidations, he said. 
“These funds serve, directly and indirectly, hundreds of thousands of our students, including some of the most vulnerable,” said Green.
According to an analysis performed by the North Carolina Justice Center’s Education & Law Project, rural school districts would be disproportionately affected. Nine of the 10 hardest-hit districts by per-student funding cuts are in rural counties, with some districts facing losses of more than $300 per student. Counties still recovering from Hurricane Helene face a combined cut of approximately $18 million. 
Mecklenburg County could lose more than $12.2 million, Wake County over $8 million, and Alamance, Guilford, Forsyth, Cumberland and other counties would each lose millions under the funding freeze.
“These funds are not discretionary. They are allocated specifically to support programs and personnel that are essential for providing a high-quality education to all students,” said Alamance-Burlington School Board Chair Sandy Ellington-Graves at the press conference. 
“Withholding these funds directly undermines our ability to serve our growing population of multilingual learners,” Ellington-Graves said.
The lawsuit is joined by attorneys general from states including California, New York, Michigan, Minnesota and Washington, along with the governors of Pennsylvania and Kentucky. It challenges what plaintiffs describe as an “unlawful and unconstitutional” decision by the Department of Education. 
The Office of Management and Budget, which oversees federal spending, has said that funding pause is related to a review of potential ideological content in some programs. State officials strongly dispute that justification, arguing that Congress already approved the funds and that students and educators should not be caught in the middle. 
“The decision to freeze $165 million in federal funding is an unnecessary and irresponsible act against our children,” Davis said. “Educating our children should rise above politics.” 
The lawsuit comes as North Carolina faces a continuing teacher shortage; nearly 9,000 teachers left the profession during the 2023–24 school year, according to state data.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7142314-1536x1152-22-1024x845.jpg,,,2025-07-14 17:09:48.351263

Shelley Moore Capito’s office in Charleston, W.Va., Monday, July 14, 2025. (Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)More than a week after President Donald Trump signed the federal legislation into law, demonstrators in Charleston, West Virginia, staged a protest of cuts to federal food assistance and health care in the Big, Beautiful Bill Act Monday afternoon. 
About two dozen protesters gathered outside the downtown office of Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. Some of them were also expected to go to Republican Sen. Jim Justice’s Charleston office following the demonstration. 
West Virginia’s entire congressional delegation, all Republicans, voted for the budget reconciliation bill, which includes historic cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. In the Mountain State, nearly 500,000 people get their health care coverage from Medicaid. About 277,000 state residents rely on SNAP. 
“A budget is a moral document, and this one is soaked in cruelty,” Pam Garrison, state tri-chair of the West Virginia Poor People’s Campaign, said during the event. “We come from many traditions, but we share one sacred call to care for the vulnerable, to welcome the stranger, to lift up the common good. Repeal this law. Repair the harm and reinvest in dignity.”
The bill extends and expands a 2017 tax law to keep individual income tax rates at the same level, according to reporting by States Newsroom. It also makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs. To do so, the legislation slashes funding to the Medicaid program and shifts significant costs of SNAP to the states for the first time. 
In a statement Monday, Kelley Moore, a spokeswoman for Capito, said that the senator believes everyone should have the right to make their voices heard in a respectful and peaceful way.
“The Big Beautiful bill, which is now law, focuses on the safety, security and prosperity that the American people want and need,” Moore said. “This comprehensive package reflects the priorities shared with President Trump — who West Virginians overwhelmingly supported in the recent election.”
Nationally, roughly 17 million people are expected to lose their health care by 2034 due to the implementation of work reporting requirements for Medicaid recipients and changes to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
In West Virginia, about at least 75,000 Medicaid recipients are expected to lose their coverage, according to an analysis by Repairers of the Breach. The bill will increase the state’s cost of SNAP benefits based on their error rate. If those costs are based on the state’s 2024 error rate, it would cost West Virginia more than $50 million, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Art Lane, of Belle, was among the about two dozen people who participated in the protest. 
He pointed to research by Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania that estimates the legislation could lead to 51,000 deaths per year due to loss of health care coverage, disenrollment of 1.38 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries and the repeal of federal nursing home staffing rules. 
“Think how many of [those deaths] are going to be West Virginians?” Lane said. “West Virginia is one of the most neediest states in the country, and there’s so many people here, so many families who depend on SNAP, who depend on Medicaid, so many disabled people, elderly people.”
“I’m out here fighting for the people and standing up for the people who are less fortunate,” he said. 
The protest was part of a series of events held in 11 southern states by the Repairers of the Breach, a national organization led by Bishop William J. Barber II that supports “moral leaders who uplift our deepest moral and constitutional values to redeem the heart and soul of America.” 
“Everyone that they hurt with this bill, we will organize,” Barber said in a statement Monday. “Through Jim Crow, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and beyond, history has consistently taught us that the poorest and most marginalized communities have a profound ability to create change — even when the future seems the bleakest. Today is no different. Yes, lawmakers have succeeded in codifying one of the most morally-bankrupt pieces of legislation in our history. But in doing so, they’ve laid the groundwork for a movement that is truly by and for poor and working class people. If we mobilize just a fraction of these people, we can transform our nation’s entire landscape.”
Similar demonstrations were held in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana, Virginia and North Carolina.

Article Summary

Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order requiring state agencies to come up with plans to respond to tariffs.
President Donald Trump is set to implement new tariffs after previously pausing them for three months.
The order requires agencies to evaluate impacts on costs, the availability of supplies, and the ability to complete projects within a given timeline.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


SPRINGFIELD — Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order Monday requiring Illinois agencies to draft recommendations to respond to tariffs being implemented by President Donald Trump.

The order requires seven state agencies to “consider the specific impacts that the U.S. tariffs have had on Illinois and provide draft recommendations of measures to mitigate the impact of these tariffs” within the next 100 days, which would be Oct. 22.

Pritzker said in a statement that tariffs amount to a tax increase on consumers and contribute to economic uncertainty.

“This Executive Order ensures we have a clear-eyed view of the impact the Trump Slump will cause from higher prices at the grocery store to uncertainty in our farms and factories,” Pritzker said. “We’re working with other states to stand up for working people and protect our economies when we can.”

The order cites large tariffs Trump has unilaterally implemented on most countries, including some of Illinois’ largest trading partners, saying the tariffs have raised prices for consumers and businesses and led to supply chain disruptions. The order says tariffs as well as retaliatory tariffs countries have imposed on the United States are hurting “vital sectors of the Illinois economy.”

After previously pushing off implementation of some tariffs until Aug. 1 to allow time for negotiations, Trump announced last week many countries will see tariffs take effect. His latest policy includes 35% tariffs on Canada, 30% on Mexico and the European Union,  and between 25% and 40% on many Asian countries. The president previously imposed 145% tariffs on goods from China in the spring, but many of his latest rates are lower than they would have been earlier this year.

Illinois imports more goods from Canada than any other country.

Order’s requirements

Under Pritzker’s executive order, state agencies must examine the impact of tariffs on certain sectors of the economy or the agency’s operations.

The departments of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and Employment Security will evaluate challenges reported by businesses, employment trends since tariffs have been implemented, and industries most affected by tariffs.

The Department of Human Services will evaluate trends in food donations and supply chain challenges for food assistance programs, as well as the purchasing power of food banks and their ability to meet demand.

The Department of Transportation and the Capitol Development Board will assess the impact of tariffs on construction costs, and the ability to purchase construction materials and complete projects within their timelines.

The Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security will evaluate any impacts to stockpiles and the ability to obtain supplies, including staying prepared for emergencies within budget constraints.

Pritzker’s executive order was part of actions taken by seven Democratic governors to understand the impact of tariffs on their states.

The justices on Monday sent the legislators’ request for their intervention to the Second Judicial Circuit. However, the justices noted that the transfer should not be read as a judgment on the merits of the Democrats’ suit.
However, the transfer likely will have the effect of delaying resolution of the case.
“We look forward to fighting in any court,” Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani wrote in a text message to Florida Phoenix. She is one of five state legislators who were denied entry when they tried to conduct an oversight visit on July 3 to the detention center in the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.

After the denial, the Florida Division of Emergency Management, the state agency in charge of the detention center, offered a tour to state lawmakers and Congress members on Saturday. Eskamani and other Democrats said the tour prompted more questions than the answers they got, and that they weren’t allowed to speak with any of the detainees.
The lawmakers argued in their petition to the Supreme Court on July 10 that their exclusion from the detention center violated state law as well as the Florida Constitution by eroding the separation of powers and improperly restricting the authority of a co-equal branch of government.

Lambert Junttila stands accused of attempting to access and tamper with voting tabulators following the 2020 election, in which former President Joe Biden defeated now President Donald Trump. According to documents filed by Special Prosecutor DJ Hilson, Lambert Junttila was “frequently” present in Oakland County hotel rooms and residences where individuals performed “testing” and/or experiments on the machines.
While Lambert Junttila was initially set to go to trial in October 2024, the case has been repeatedly pushed back, with Judge Jeffery S. Matis telling the court room Friday this case is the oldest on his docket. 
Alongside her case in Oakland County, Lambert Junttila faces charges in Hillsdale County, where it’s alleged that she and former Adams Township Clerk Stephanie Scott permitted an unauthorized computer examiner to access voter data concerning the 2020 election, which included non-public information.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In her request to adjourn Monday’s trial, Lambert argued that Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater had offered testimony during a preliminary examination in Hillsdale that contradicted statements he made to the grand jury, which ultimately indicted Lambert Junttila, alongside former Republican candidate for attorney general Matt DePerno and former State Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) for allegedly tampering with election equipment. 
“Had he testified before the grand jury as he testified today, I don’t believe there would be an indictment,” Lambert Junttila said. 
However, in order to impeach Brater as a witness, Lambert said she would need a transcript of Friday’s proceedings in Hillsdale, arguing the evidence would prove her innocence.
She later informed the court that the transcript had been ordered and would be available in 10 days. 
While Brater is a witness for the prosecution, Special Prosecutor DJ Hilson told the court that Brater was in the middle of the pack for their witnesses. He criticized Lambert Junttila for repeated delays arguing Matis should deny the request for adjournment. 
“We have never asked for an adjournment. We have never asked to delay these proceedings. We’ve always stood before this court and said we are prepared and ready to try this case.… I’m ready to show up Monday morning and pick a jury, and I’m prepared and ready to try this case,” Hilson noted the costs incurred by scheduling and rescheduling hotel and travel arrangements for out-of-state witnesses. 
While Matis disagreed with several arguments in Lambert Junttila’s request to push back the trial date, he ultimately granted the request due to the similarity of matters discussed in Brater’s testimony to those in the Oakland County case, with a lack of sufficient time to get a transcript before trial. 
“Defense will say some things were exculpatory. The prosecution will probably say, no, it wasn’t. That’s why we have trials. That’s why we have juries to hear evidence and make those calls. But hearing what was represented today that [Brater] testified, that at least the representation is what he testified to relates to the issues in this case, I think there’s a basis to adjourn the trial,” Matis said in granting the request. 
Angela Benander, the chief communications office for the Michigan Department of State said the department had no comment to offer as the trials are ongoing. 
Parties are set to meet for another pretrial conference on August 13 to set a trial date.

Article Summary

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Schaumburg, is seeking the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Springfield.
Krishnamoorthi says he wants to put his middle-class values to work in the Senate.
As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, he says he is capable of immediately engaging in foreign policy.
• He was a lead sponsor of a law to force the sale of communist Chinese-owned TikTok for it to continue operating in the U.S.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


SPRINGFIELD — Raja Krishnamoorthi has worn many hats: lawyer, small business owner, and for the last 10 years, United States representative.

The 51-year-old Schaumburg Democrat, who represents Illinois’ 8th Congressional District across the northwest suburbs and was born in India, didn’t always have a middle-class life.

Shortly after immigrating to the United States in the early 1970s, his father lost his job and the Krishnamoorthi family lived in public housing and used food stamps to buy groceries. Eventually, his father found a job in Peoria, where Krishnamoorthi grew up until moving away to attend Princeton, then Harvard.

He said the lessons he learned from his father’s struggles and living life on public assistance programs have motivated his life in public service and are driving his campaign to fill the open Senate seat in Illinois being vacated in 2026 by retiring U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin.





“He basically instructed my brother and me every night at the dinner table, ‘Remember the greatness of this country and whatever you do next, make sure it’s there for the next families that need it,’” Krishnamoorthi recalled his father saying. “That became my mission statement.”

Krishnamoorthi told Capitol News Illinois in an interview that Democrats must make addressing affordability their top priority in the 2026 election. It’s particularly true, he said, as Democrats found themselves on the losing end of a battle in Congress with Republicans over a proposal to slash spending on social service programs like food stamps.

Congressional Democrats have faced criticisms that they haven’t done enough to fight back against the Trump administration’s priorities – and Krishnamoorthi said it isn’t off base. Democrats need to win voters’ trust, he said.

“I think we have to speak to the economic concerns of average voters, average Americans, people like my parents and others who feel that it's getting harder and harder to make ends meet,” Krishnamoorthi said.

“The most sensitive nerve in the body is the pocketbook nerve, and unless you kind of deal with that, they're not going to listen to you,” he added.

Krishnamoorthi said he has a record of doing that in Congress and said one of his priorities if elected to the Senate would be to expand a 2018 law he sponsored that modernized and increased funding for career and technical education. He’s now calling for doubling funding for the program, arguing it is vital to growing middle class jobs and ensuring American businesses can hire workers with the right skills.

National security issues 

Krishnamoorthi brings national security experience to the race as a member of the U.S. House intelligence committee, which includes access to classified material and other information provided to Congress by the nation’s national security and intelligence agencies.

Over the last month, the United States’ attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities has brought that country’s nuclear capabilities and ambitions to the forefront of national politics alongside wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

“I don’t think a military solution is sufficient to deal with the underlying issue, which is we must make sure Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon,” Krishnamoorthi said.

Success of last month's bombing has been unclear, with President Donald Trump calling it a great success while other reports have suggested it only set Iran’s nuclear capabilities back a few months. Krishnamoorthi said he’s concerned the U.S. and international inspectors can’t account for all of Iran’s supply of uranium and other nuclear equipment.

“I’m concerned that they may potentially be in a situation where they’re going to rush a nuclear weapon and we’re not going to be aware of it because they’re going to go so underground,” he said.

Krishnamoorthi said he believes the Trump administration must get back to the negotiating table with Iran, which he thinks the administration is “eager” to do.

Krishnamoorthi said he was also concerned that the president didn’t seek congressional approval for the strike. Trump’s strike on Iran was just one of several examples of presidents in both parties taking military action without getting approval from Congress. Krishnamoorthi argued there’s broader concerns about growing powers of the executive branch.

“It's happened over the years under Democratic and Republican administrations,” he said. “I think after this presidency, hopefully, maybe even during this presidency, we're going to have to embark on almost a post-Watergate style of reforms which claw back power from the executive branch and put it back in the people's hands.”

Krishnamoorthi also serves on a House committee on the Chinese Communist Party and was one of the lead sponsors of a law to force the sale of TikTok for it to continue operating in the U.S. TikTok’s parent company is based in Beijing, and like other Chinese companies, has ties to the CCP.

“I don't want it to be controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” Krishnamoorthi said. “The CCP does bad things with the data, with the algorithms, etc., that it gets access to.”

TikTok’s future remains up in the air as Trump continues to push off the sale’s deadline. Krishnamoorthi said he’s concerned Trump’s tariffs on China are giving the CCP leverage in negotiations over the sale.

Race for clout 

Krishnamoorthi and his opponents – Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly – are working to carve a lane in the race, which includes winning over support from party officials.

Stratton has already been endorsed by Gov. JB Pritzker and U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, and on Monday, received new endorsements from House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, and State Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Westchester.

“Juliana has always led with compassion, experience, and a commitment to public service, and I know she’ll bring those same grounding principles to Washington,” Welch said in a statement. “As Lieutenant Governor, she’s been a key partner to the Illinois House, working hand-in-hand with our members to deliver real results for Illinois.”

Meanwhile, Krishnamoorthi has been touting support he has received from local officials. After announcing support from 20 mayors and other local officials in the first weeks of his campaign, he announced endorsements from another 40 officials on Monday.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-14 20:15:12+00:00,Mississippi Today,IHL reps assure wary JSU alums the president search will be ‘open and engaging’,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/14/ihl-reps-assure-wary-jsu-alums-the-president-search-will-be-open-and-engaging/,JSU alumni remain wary about how the Institutions of Higher Learning board will pick the school's next president.,"In the aftermath of a revolving door of presidents at Jackson State University, members of Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning board tasked with naming a new leader sought to defuse alumni concerns. 
But after an hour-long Zoom meeting with dozens of JSU graduates last week, some alumni remained uneasy that the state’s college governing board would fall back on the same playbook.
“Even Ray Charles can see the failures,” Sen. Hillman Frazier,  D-Jackson, a member of the Universities and Colleges Committee, said. “They should be upfront on their intentions this time to have a fair and transparent search. They need to double down on their commitment to stabilize their credibility because it’s shot.” 
The state’s largest historically Black university will be embarking on its fourth leadership search this fall after more than three president turnovers in less than seven years. The IHL board, which oversees and selects the school’s presidents, announced the resignation of Marcus Thompson in May. 
No reason was given as to why he left his post as university president. 
Jackson State University National Alumni Association invited some of its members to an exclusive, hour-long Zoom conversation with two IHL board members on July 7 to address concerns surrounding the university’s forthcoming presidential search. 
Patrease Edwards, president of the national association, kicked off the conversation. Moderator Michael Jefferson, the group’s information, communications and technology chair, asked Steve Cunningham and Gee Ogletree a series of questions ranging from the college board’s vetting process to policies and procedures to ensure a fair and transparent search.

Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
The roughly 71 alumni association members who signed up for the conversation submitted 52 questions. Nearly 14 of those questions, which were screened by the national alumni association, were directed to board members (There was no chat feature available.) It’s unclear how many of those who signed up attended the call. Edwards said students also joined the call. 
In June, the national alumni association emailed its members inviting them to participate in the event. In the days leading up to the call, few details were shared. Alums who signed up to participate had questions about which IHL board members would be attending. Others said they didn’t know where to submit their questions. The link to the Zoom meeting was shared in an email from Edwards around noon on the day of the actual talk. Alums who said they signed up for the event said they didn’t get the email or missed it. 
Cunningham, vice president of the IHL board, said he and Ogletree couldn’t answer specific or personal questions about past presidents because of confidentiality and legal personnel constraints. 
He said a formal committee for the president search has not been named but that he anticipated more engagement with faculty, student groups and the alumni association during the board’s community listening sessions during the upcoming school year. 
In past presidential searches for Jackson State, IHL launched a national search, opened an online survey and provided community listening sessions to help write a candidate profile, all first steps in the process. Ultimately, it will be the board that will make the choice for the school’s next president, he said. 
“Of course it demands a delicate balance of transparency and solicitation of opinions and confidentiality for those going through the recruitment and interview process,” Cunningham said.  “IHL board of trustees reaffirms its commitment to an open and engaged process.” 
Criticism has dogged the board’s history of forgoing its own policies and appointing internal hires as top leaders, leading to protests, accusations of favoritism and bills to abolish the IHL board. 
Thompson worked as deputy commissioner and chief administrative officer at IHL from 2009 before becoming president. He had no experience leading a university. His appointment as president was reminiscent of IHL’s decision to hire Glenn Boyce to head the University of Mississippi. Boyce had led IHL’s leadership search for Ole Miss. Both decisions eschewed search candidates in favor of an internal hire. 
Board members were asked if Denise Jones Gregory, now the interim president, would get a fair shot for the permanent position. Gregory, a JSU alum, is a native of Columbus Mississippi, as is Cunningham. 
Ogletree explained interim or acting presidents would have to step down to apply for the job if they wanted to apply for the role. However, if a number of supporters expressed their favor for Gregory as a top choice for leadership, the board could waive its policies to ensure she remains in the role. Olegtree said it’s too early to discuss how this process would go for Gregory. 
“When we have found good, strong interims and when we hear from the various constituencies that they are the person that fits the criteria… then we haven’t hesitated to hire that person,” Ogletree said.  “I will tell you Ole Miss is thrilled with Dr. Boyce now and Alcorn with Dr. Cook and we certainly have every expectation Jackson State is  going to be thrilled with its next leader.” 
Last year, IHL used this provision to appoint Tracy Cook, president of Alcorn State University, marking the board’s ninth time in 10 years it has hired an internal candidate as a top leader. 
The board also suspended its search to hire Joe Paul, then the interim president at the University of Southern Mississippi, after he received support during the listening sessions. The appointment came with criticism from faculty and staff about the lack of transparency with IHL’s presidential search process. 
Nora Miller served as Mississippi University for Women’s acting president, senior vice president for administration and chief financial officer before the board permanently appointed her the day of the listening sessions, another example of an internal hire by the board. 
The biggest batch of questions alums submitted revolved around the board’s vetting process. Board members explained they obtain references and/or hire consulting firms to contact references. 
They said the 12 trustees try to line up resumes and job requirements with the characteristics needed for president. They run background checks — inquiring about motor vehicles, criminal records and credit checks as well as internet and article information — but they’re not “foolproof.”
“It almost implies like we have some type of magic wand where we should be able to predict a human being’s behavior after they are appointed to a position of power, and we know that that is just impossible,” Cunningham said. 
Ultimately, the board members said they will stick to its policies and “maybe make more calls this time.” 
“We’re certainly aware of the need to do all that we can do,” Olegtree said. 
Tim Rush, a 1986 JSU alum and former dean of students at Holmes Community College, said he appreciated the conversation but wanted to make it clear that all alumni do not share the same views and opinions as the national alumni association. He said IHL needs to truly listen to all stakeholders when making this next appointment. 
“The best leaders will emerge from an open and transparent process that includes valued input from all stakeholders, and we will be able to support and rally around whoever that may be,” said Rush, a member of Thee 1877 Project, a small group of alums not affiliated with the national association who have been advocating for school issues around student housing, philanthropy and funding. 
Mark Dawson, chairman of the 1877 project, said he felt the board members had an overall “cavalier” attitude when answering alumni questions, particularly whether they have learned lessons or will examine new approaches for their next search. Board members need to recognize their past failures have left a festering wound of trust for supporters of the university. 
“Have you looked at what this turnover has done to enrollment, institutional giving, expansion of academic programs or our inability to move from an R2 to R1 research status?” Dawson asked. “Not examining the wrongdoings with this process has been damaging to your bottom line: students, faculty and community.” 
Others question the impact of the board’s decisions on Jackson State University’s overall growth and economic impact on the state’s capital city.

“In the end, the state is the one who is suffering to grow a really strong institution based in the state’s capital,” Frazier said. “Students want a viable option. They’re beginning to look elsewhere to fulfill their dreams. (The board’s) decisions have been costly. They need to follow their plans and don’t deviate from them. Stick with the game plan and don’t waste alums’ and taxpayers’ time this time around.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06182234/JSU18.jpg,,,2025-07-14 17:09:48.351263

One of the primary drinking water sources for the region, the river has high nitrate levels that have led to water restrictions for some 600,000 customers. (Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
 
The role of agriculture
As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.
Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
 
Citizen action
The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walter League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.
While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
 
Small towns struggle
Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

An attorney for the project, known as Windham Energy Center, notified the siting council in a letter last month that the developer had decided to withdraw its application to build the 325-megawatt facility. The decision came after town officials raised concerns about the proposed facility, particularly the risk of fire, and requested more information from developers.
The attorney, Ken Baldwin, said on Monday that he was not authorized to talk about the project and referred requests for comment to the Israel-based developer, Sunflower Sustainable Investments.
Representatives for that company did not responded to multiple requests for comment. 
The company’s decision to withdraw its application was first reported by New London’s The Day newspaper.
It was not the first time developers had sought to use the property, which is located next to existing Eversource transmission lines, to supply power to the regional electric grid.
In 2016, Florida-based NTE Energy proposed building a natural gas-fired power plant on the same location. That plan drew intense criticism from environmental groups, with protests held both in Killingly and at the state Capitol in Hartford.
While the siting council gave its approval to that project in 2019, it continued to be a source of debate for several more years until federal regulators dealt a final blow to NTE’s efforts in 2022. Last year, Windham Energy Center’s developers filed their application to use the site as a battery storage facility.
According to Windham Energy’s application, the project would have cost an estimated $200 million and taken a little more than a year to build. The plans called for lithium-ion batteries housed in dozens of prefabricated storage containers, as well as an electrical substation connecting to the regional grid.
Almost from the start, however, the project faced difficulties due to the fact that NTE Energy continued to hold the certificate of approval from the siting council to develop the property for a power plant — despite having since gone out of business. In November, Baldwin filed a request with the siting council to reopen that approval process for the purpose of resolving the issue.
In the meantime, Killingly officials began to raise a number of concerns about the project in filings made with the siting council. Those concerns touched on noise and gases that could be emitted from the facility, as well as the potential for intense battery fires known as “thermal runaways.”
Local officials asked for the developers to provide more information and, in some cases, to alter their plans to address those concerns — such as through the construction of vegetation barriers. In January, Baldwin indicated that the company was willing to take additional steps to address some of the local concerns.
But before those issues were resolved, Baldwin sent the letter on June 3 withdrawing the application. 
Melanie Bachman, the executive director of the siting council, said in her acknowledgment of that letter that Windham Energy would have to submit new applications should it seek to restart the approval process.
Representatives from Killingly, including Acting Town Manager Frances Conroy and Economic Development Director Jill St. Clair, were not available for comment on Monday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.32.52 PM-1024x546.png,,,2025-07-14 16:13:02.875782

Gov. Kim Reynolds announced in April she will not seek reelection for another term, leaving the governor’s seat open for the first time in over a decade — which led to a surge of interest among Republican officials interested in taking Reynolds’ mantle.
One of the expected top contenders was Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, a longtime supporter of Trump. The president has told Iowans he believes Bird will “be your governor someday, I predict.” However, Bird announced in early July she will not run for the position and instead seek another term as attorney general.
In May, Nunn had said he did not plan to run for governor. But last week, sources close to the Iowa Republican said Bird’s decision had inspired Nunn to consider a gubernatorial bid, the Des Moines Register reported.
That consideration was short-lived — in part because the president personally called for Nunn to stay in Congress. Trump said in a Friday social media post that he had spoken to Nunn, who was committed to the mission of “HOLDING THE MAJORITY” in the U.S. House.
“He is a team player, with a tremendous future — And 100% MAGA,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Zach needs our full support to win Iowa-03. He is fighting for the Farmer, and everything else that Iowa stands for, including, of course, Lower Taxes, and our always under siege Second Amendment. Zach Nunn has my Complete and Total Endorsement. HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!”
The 3rd Congressional District seat is expected to be one of the most competitive races in 2026. Alongside Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, represented by Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Democrats have highlighted the 3rd District as a potential pick-up in the U.S. House. There are currently two Democratic contenders aiming to compete against Nunn in the general election — Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst and state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines.
While Nunn is not running for the governor’s race, another member of Iowa’s federal delegation, U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, has launched an “exploratory” committee for governor. He represents Iowa’s 4th District — a longtime conservative stronghold that political forecasters say is unlikely to see a Democrat win, even without an incumbent Republican running.
Two of Feenstra’s Iowa colleagues in Washington, Miller-Meeks and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, endorsed Feenstra’s gubernatorial bid in July.
State Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, is also considering a gubernatorial run with an exploratory committee, and Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston and former state Rep. Brad Sherman have launched campaigns for governor. There is also an expected primary for the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, with Iowa Auditor Rob Sand the expected frontrunner. Former political operative Julie Stauch is also running as a Democratic candidate for governor, announcing her campaign in June.

(Photo by Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Twenty-eight cities and counties including Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and Rochester, New York, joined a lawsuit July 10 challenging Trump administration attempts to withhold federal funds because of local policies on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; gender equity; and abortion access.
Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.”
The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.

Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Friends of the Vicksburg National Military Park recently announced a $2.8 million private donation to the park by John L. Nau III, a Texas businessman and philanthropist who was a founding board member of the nonprofit Friends organization.
The National Park Service’s Centennial Challenge program will match the donation with $2.5 million in federal funds.
The money will go to restoring the Illinois Memorial and removing an unrelated building that was “erroneously constructed on core battlefield ground — an intrusion that obscures the story and sacrifices of the men who fought and died there in 1863,” according to the Friends.
“Standing on restored battlefield ground gives visitors a chance to truly understand the story of Vicksburg — not just read about it, but feel it,” Bess Averett, executive director of the Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park, said in a press release. “Visitors deserve to walk this hallowed ground and see it as Union and Confederate soldiers saw it during the siege.”
In 1863, Union forces led by Gen. Ulysses S. Grant laid siege to Vicksburg. After 47 days, the Confederate army surrendered, and the defeat turned the tide of the Civil War as the Union gained control of the Mississippi River.
Vicksburg National Military Park was established in 1899 at the battleground. It commemorates the siege and its role in the Civil War, as well as those who fought.
The Illinois Memorial is dedicated to more than 36,000 soldiers from that state who fought in Vicksburg. Both the stone and the inscriptions inside the building have worn down from weather exposure.
In the release, Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park said the park needs both public and private support, as the National Park Service manages over 400 units nationwide.
“We need donors and volunteers now more than ever before,” Averett said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/14142618/AP220194967420.jpg,,,2025-07-14 16:13:02.875782

Gov. Michelle Strinden, died Sunday after a 17-month battle with brain cancer. (Photo provided by Office of the Governor)Dr. Tom Strinden, the husband of North Dakota Lt. Gov. Michelle Strinden, died Sunday. 
A new release from the office of Gov. Kelly Armstrong said Strinden died after a 17-month battle with brain cancer. 
Michelle Strinden was a Fargo lawmaker before being tapped as Armstrong’s running mate last year. 
“Tom was Michelle’s biggest fan, encouraging her to enter public service and supporting her journey to the Legislature and lieutenant governor’s office. Even after his cancer diagnosis and initial surgery, he returned to his work as a gifted eye surgeon who cared deeply about his patients and improving their quality of life,” Armstrong said in the news release. 
Tom Strinden had an eye surgical practice in Fargo since 1995, according to his bio on the Bagan Strinden Vision website. He also was an associate clinical professor at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and volunteered on medical mission trips to India, Honduras, and Haiti. 
He was one of five children of Earl Strinden, who served as the House majority leader in the North Dakota Legislature.

That's higher than the state teacher vacancy rate of 16%.,"The Kirksey Middle School bleachers were packed on Thursday evening with nearly 200 people looking for a job at Jackson Public Schools. 
Among the crowd was Sade Montgomery, who was nervously thumbing through copies of her resume. Even though she isn’t certified to teach, Montgomery was looking for a job that would let her spend more time with her 5-year-old daughter. She thought the fair was a good place to start.
Devante Horton, just a few bleachers down, had a similar idea. The 22-year-old — suited up, with a Jackson State University pin gleaming on his chest — attended Jim Hill High School and later studied political science in college. But after graduating, he’d had some trouble finding a job. He decided he wanted to try his hand at teaching.
“I want to give back to my city and the district that I came from,” Horton said. “I’m nervous, but I feel like I’m going to leave here with a job.”
Both Montgomery and Horton had a lot of options in front of them — nearly all of the district’s schools were represented at the job fair, as well as several central office departments. And as they went from table to table, Tommy Nalls, who’s in charge of recruitment at JPS, stood off to the side, watching.
As of last week, about one in four Jackson Public Schools teaching positions remained unfilled. Though district officials noted that count includes jobs that are pending hires, that’s higher than the state’s teacher vacancy rate, which sits at about 16%, according to the most recent data.
Nationally, teachers have been in short supply for years. The issue, worsened by the pandemic, stems from a combination of factors, including low compensation and difficult workloads. It can be even harder to staff classrooms in districts such as Jackson Public Schools, Nalls said, which faces unique challenges because it serves a high population of students from marginalized communities.

One way JPS is combatting the shortage: Taking advantage of alternate routes for people to become certified teachers. Nalls took advantage of one such pathway himself when he entered the education field two decades ago. 
“Honestly, at first, I was a lot like these people here,” he said, gesturing to the job fair attendees around him. “I needed a new job.”
Nalls, who has a biology degree from Tougaloo College, worked at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and AT&T before a friend suggested he should look into becoming a teacher. He happened to be at the right place at the right time — Nalls was dropping off his information at the district’s administrative offices when Murrah High School’s assistant principal walked in and said they needed a science teacher. 
Nalls got his start in teaching after the district requested a provisional license for him — which is what the district will do for job fair hirees without teaching certifications. 
“What we do as a district is once we get them hired in a position they’re qualified for, we request a provisional license from the State Department of Education,” he said. “Then, during the year, we coach the teachers on certification, so we advise them on what tests they need to take and where the programs are that they can complete in order to become certified. And if they need assistance with the Praxis test in some of our hard to staff areas, we even provide vouchers and preparation to help them study for those exams to become properly certified.” 
According to Nalls, the district’s strategies are working, but they’re up against more than low pay and worsening student behavior. Teaching, he said, is no longer a sought-after profession.
A few years ago, he asked a group of educators to raise their hands if they spoke to their own child about becoming a teacher. Out of a room of 30, just four or five people raised their hands. 
“I’ll never forget that,” he said. “We have to do a better job of championing education within our community … There are issues, of course, but we have to help people realize that it’s just not as bad as they make it out to be.”
After about an hour, Montgomery hadn’t gotten a job offer, but several schools had expressed interest — she was especially excited about one in particular that was just down the road from her daughter’s school. 
“The only thing that I’m a little nervous about is the pay because I know it will probably be a pay cut,” she said. “But I think it’s worth it to be able to be with my daughter.”
Even as the crowd thinned out, Horton stuck around, diligently visiting every table. By the end of the two-hour job fair, Horton had received a couple of job offers. 
And after mulling it over, Horton on Friday accepted a position teaching 9th grade social studies at Jim Hill — his alma mater. He said he’s most looking forward to bonding with his students when school starts in a few weeks.
“For me to be able to go back and show them that somebody actually came from the same seat that you all are in, went to college, got his degree, and is now working in a professional field, I can show them that you can do it as well,” Horton said. “It’s a surreal feeling.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/14135713/IMG_6322.jpg,,,2025-07-14 16:13:02.875782

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Two lawsuits involving pipeline company Summit Carbon Solutions and the North Dakota Public Service Commission have been combined. 
The PSC, which approved a route permit Iowa-based Summit last year, requested that the two lawsuits be merged. 
One lawsuit is led by Burleigh County, the other by a group of landowners who oppose Summit’s proposed five-state carbon capture pipeline that would end at an underground storage area northwest of Bismarck. 
CO2 storage law challenged in North Dakota Supreme Court hearing

In requesting the consolidation, attorney Zachary Pelham, representing the PSC, said “the two appeals are a mirror image.”   
Attorneys for Burleigh County and Summit Carbon Solutions did not object to the consolidation. 
Among the issues raised in the cases is a challenge to the PSC’s ruling that states zoning rules trump county zoning ordinances on pipelines. Plaintiffs also argue the agency did not give enough consideration to the safety of residents along the pipeline route. 
Another pending lawsuit involves a landowner challenge to the North Dakota Industrial Commission’s approval of permanent underground storage permits for Summit. 
Summit plans to gather carbon dioxide emissions from ethanol plants in five states, including one in eastern North Dakota, and use pipelines to send the CO2 to a sequestration area in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties
In another case, the North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments in April in a challenge to a state law related to underground storage of CO2.
Summit describes its project as the world’s largest carbon capture and storage project. It would take advantage of federal tax credits that promote reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Supporters say it would help ethanol producers compete in the low-carbon fuel market and benefit farmers who supply the ethanol plants with corn. 
In addition to North Dakota, Summit has obtained a state pipeline permit in Iowa and approval for a short section of the route in Minnesota. Summit has so far been unsuccessful in South Dakota. Nebraska has no state agency that handles CO2 pipeline projects.

Andy Beshear and Democratic leaders from other states and Washington, D.C., are suing the Trump administration over a freeze of $6.8 billion in federal funding for K-12 schools that began earlier this month. 
In a press release about the lawsuit filed Monday, Beshear said the matter is “not about Democrat or Republican” and that he joined the suit because “these funds were appropriated by Congress for the education of Kentucky’s children, and it’s my job to ensure we get them,” 
“In Kentucky, $96 million in federal education funds are at risk,” Beshear said. “Our kids and our future depend on a strong education, and these funds are essential to making sure our kids succeed.” 
The U.S. Department of Education told states on June 30 that it would be withholding funding for several programs, including before- and after-school programs, migrant education and English-language learning. The next day, July 1, is when the funds are typically sent out as educators prepare for the coming school year.
The governor’s office said the Kentucky Department of Education, the state’s education agency, was set to receive $87 million to distributer to local school districts and another $9 million was to go to the Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet for grants to support adult literacy. 
Beshear has been among Democratic state officials challenging some Trump administration decisions in court, including a federal funding freeze announced in January.

But those obituaries, however rich and admiring, miss something essential. They chronicle his proximity to power but overlook one of the most powerful things about him: David Gergen never believed that public service was only for the elite, the famous, or the already powerful. He believed it was for everyone. And he lived that belief in the most generous, human ways—far from the marble halls and green rooms where he so often walked. 
I knew of David Gergen long before I ever met him. He was one of those names—like “Kissinger” or “Carville”—that signified a proximity to the presidency. But I met a very different David in 2012 when I was launching New Politics, an organization committed to recruiting servant leaders—veterans, AmeriCorps alumni, Peace Corps volunteers—into politics.  
When I was first introduced to him, we had no major funders, no track record, no brand. Just a belief that service should be a qualification for holding political power, and a hope that we could help reshape American politics around that idea. 
It’s not often that someone like David Gergen takes a chance on someone like me. But he did. He was the very first person who believed in our vision—before it was safe to do so. And he didn’t just encourage it from a distance. He got in the weeds.  
He offered counsel, opened doors, and lent his name. And in our first conversation, after I outlined my vision of recruiting those who had performed service work into politics, he said: “You should call Seth Moulton.” 
At the time, Moulton was a decorated Marine veteran and former graduate student of David’s. Gergen saw in him what he always looked for in potential leaders—not polish, not pedigree, but character. Integrity. Service. Purpose.  
Seth would go on to become our first New Politics recruit. He would win his congressional race, in 2014, and later credit Gergen as one of the people who shaped his path into public life. That story played out again and again. Behind so many public servants today is a quiet conversation with David Gergen—encouraging them to step up, helping them believe they belonged. 
David mentored a generation of young leaders, not because it burnished his resume, but because he genuinely believed in passing the torch. He invited me once to speak at his famous class at Harvard’s Kennedy School—Leadership and Public Service.  
David taught that class, not like a lofty theorist, but like a coach at the blackboard. He didn’t just teach ideas—he inspired idealism. Students left his classroom believing that politics didn’t have to be broken, that they could be part of the solution. 
I often wonder how many changemakers, candidates, and civic entrepreneurs were quietly emboldened by a word or gesture from him. I know I was. And I know I wasn’t alone. 
David was one of the best talent scouts I’ve ever known. I would regularly get emails from him urging me to connect with “an amazing student”—and he was always right. Several years ago, he wrote, “Emily, meet Phillip Jones. He’s in grad school here and you need to get coffee.” We did.  
Today, Phillip is the mayor of Newport News, Virginia, and a rising star in the Democratic Party. 
A significant number of New Politics candidates came our way because David saw their potential before anyone else did. 
We tend to revere public figures for what they did in power, but with David, I think the more enduring legacy might be what he did with his influence. He didn’t hoard it. He used it to lift up others. 
That is, in many ways, the story of New Politics. We’ve now helped elect nearly 200 servant leaders to office—from Congress to school boards. Our work has grown in scope and scale, but it still rests on that original foundation of belief—that service matters, that courage and integrity are non-negotiable, that leadership should be about putting others first.  
Those values animated David’s life. And in a very real way, they animate ours because of him. 
David showed up for people, for ideas, for democracy itself. And he did so with wisdom and a fierce belief that we could do better. 
In this moment when public life often feels small and cynical, when politics feels performative rather than principled, David Gergen’s life reminds us of what leadership can look like: curious, humble, grounded in service. 
His legacy will be measured not only in the presidents he advised but in the young leaders he mentored, the organizations he helped launch, and the ideals he carried forward.  
We lost a giant last week. But more than that, we lost a good man. And for those of us who were lucky enough to be guided by him, the only fitting tribute is to keep building the better politics he believed was still possible. 
Emily Cherniak is the founder and executive director of New Politics.

(Photo by University of Maine)The University of Maine System is seeking to add accelerated degrees catered to adult learners at several campuses with the goal of addressing workforce shortages in Maine.
At their Monday meeting, system trustees approved four new, shorter bachelor’s degree programs in public administration and psychology, making the state’s public universities the first in Maine to seek accreditor approval to introduce such programs. Contingent upon approval from the New England Commission of Higher Education, which will likely take a few months, the system is aiming to start the new programs as early as next summer.
While a traditional bachelor’s degree typically requires four years of full-time study and at least 120 credit hours of college coursework, the newer 90-credit degree programs have been tested across the country as a faster, more affordable alternative. Last year, a few states participated in a pilot collaboration called the College-in-3 Exchange to begin considering how they could offer three-year programs. 
The University of Maine System will seek approval to add 90-credit bachelor’s degree programs in public administration, business management and psychology online at schools and campuses in Augusta, Fort Kent, Machias and Presque Isle.
“These new high-quality, accelerated degree programs build on our tradition of academic innovation that meets the market and enable our students to realize an earlier return on their investment in their postsecondary education, while getting Maine employers more of the qualified employees they so urgently need,” said Chancellor Dannel Malloy in a statement.
This concept has been in development for more than a year, with universities putting forth proposals for the accelerated programs. The programs will be limited to adult learners who have prior college credit but have been out of higher education for at least two years. 
At the Monday meeting, trustees also decided to eliminate seven degree programs and suspending two others, citing low enrollment or comparable degrees offered elsewhere in the system. They also opted to add a new Master of Education degree program at University of Maine at Farmington, which has grown its graduate student enrollment by 44% over the past five years and is known for its teacher preparation programs.

Between new treatment efforts in Stanton and ongoing concerns about contamination in the Christina River, PFAS have emerged as a growing concern in Delaware, raising questions about health, accountability, and cleanup.
So, what are PFAS? And why do they matter? 
PFAS—short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances—are a class of human-made chemicals used in products like nonstick cookware, waterproof clothing, and firefighting foam. They’re known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down easily and can accumulate in the human body and environment.
Where PFAS are showing up in Delaware
A recent Delaware Currents article identified the Christina River as a “hotspot” for both legacy contaminants and PFAS. This includes areas in Wilmington and the surrounding Christina Basin, such as the Brandywine River, Red Clay and White Clay creeks, Shellpot Creek, and several smaller tributaries.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) has been tracking contamination through its Watershed Approach to Toxics Assessment and Restoration (WATAR) program.
The DNREC said that between 2013 and 2018, it “collected a comprehensive set of sediment, surface water and fish tissue samples from watersheds across the state.”
In a statement to Delaware Live, DNREC wrote that its 2015 evaluation of the Christina Basin “identified the tidal Brandywine River and lower tidal Christina River as an area that was more impacted when compared to other areas. As such, additional investigation and source control actions have occurred since that time in an attempt to reduce the associated impacts to aquatic life and human health.”
PFAS were not part of that 2015 assessment, but DNREC has since expanded its scope. The agency said it is now investigating “drinking water, groundwater, wastewater, soil, sediment, fish tissue, air, biosolids, etc. in an attempt to characterize PFAS impacts and to help prioritize resources.”
The agency emphasized that “it’s not a surprise to DNREC scientists that PFAS concentrations are elevated in some of the industrialized areas of the state where legacy contamination is also greater.”
Who is most at risk?
Some Delawareans may be more vulnerable than others. According to the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH), “children, pregnant individuals, and low-income communities may face heightened risks due to factors such as developing physiology, increased exposure through water and food, and limited access to mitigation resources.”
Laura Matusheski, spokesperson for DPH, cited peer-reviewed EPA research showing that PFAS exposure may lead to “reproductive effects such as decreased fertility or increased high blood pressure in pregnant women and developmental effects or delays in children, including low birth weight, accelerated puberty, bone variations, or behavioral changes.”
A new treatment plant in Stanton
One of the most visible responses to PFAS in Delaware is the new Veolia PFAS treatment facility, which opened in Stanton earlier this summer. It provides filtered drinking water for more than 100,000 residents in New Castle County and is expected to meet federal PFAS standards ahead of schedule.
“Yes, the new Stanton PFAS treatment facility is expected to significantly reduce public health concerns in the area by removing PFAS from the water supply,” said Matusheski. “DPH will measure its impact through ongoing water quality testing and health monitoring.”
Environmental attorney James L. Ferraro Jr., who represents public water systems nationwide, called the plant “a positive” step. 
“Some of our clients would look very similar to that,” he said. “They were totally caught off guard with this. They didn’t even know PFAS was in the water. They didn’t even know what PFAS was until the recent past.”
Ferraro said the treatment facility is likely using granular activated carbon, “generally one of the three treatment technologies that can filter out PFAS” and noted that even at $35 million is pretty cheap for facilities of this size. 
“Sometimes you’re seeing a moderately sized community looking at a nine-figure bill” to build or upgrade their treatment systems,” he said.
Why are PFAS so hard to control?
PFAS are found in a wide range of products and environments, and once released, they don’t go away easily.
“PFAS are just so ubiquitous, not only in the United States, but around the globe. Unfortunately, you find PFAS now in the most remote places,” Ferraro explained. “It’s in 98-plus percent of the human population’s blood at some level.” 
Some of the most concentrated PFAS “point sources,” he said, include military bases, airports, and fire training facilities, largely due to the historic use of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) in firefighting. 
Industrial facilities are also major contributors to the PFAS problem, such as the DuPont company. 
“DuPont is a huge company in Delaware,” Ferraro said. “They’re a big defendant in the [national PFAS litigation]. Some of those point sources are industrial facilities that are either manufacturing PFAS or building a product where PFAS is used in high concentrations, and it’s discharged into a local water source.”
After reaching out to DuPont’s communication team about these claims, their spokesperson stated, “DuPont de Nemours has never manufactured PFOA, PFOS or firefighting foam.”
That claim is technically true because of a corporate restructuring. In 2015, the original DuPont—E.I. du Pont de Nemours—spun off its performance chemicals business into a new company, Chemours, transferring PFAS-related products, manufacturing facilities, and environmental liabilities to the new entity.
In 2019, DuPont de Nemours was formed as part of a corporate merger and reorganization, separate from the legacy company. The original DuPont has since been renamed EIDP, Inc., and is now part of Corteva Agriscience.
Still, DuPont’s long-standing presence and influence in Delaware remain significant. According to the company’s website, “has used science and technology to empower the world with essential innovations” for over 115 years. Among those innovations,  the discovery of Teflon (PTFE) in 1938, a nonstick coating that became one of the most commercially successful and environmentally persistent PFAS compounds.
In June 2023, Chemours, DuPont de Nemours, and Corteva announced a $1.185 billion settlement to resolve PFAS-related drinking water claims from public water systems across the U.S. The agreement covers systems with PFAS detections or those required to monitor under EPA rules, including many AFFF. Under the deal, Chemours contributed 50% of the settlement fund, while DuPont and Corteva split the remaining half.
The companies denied any wrongdoing but said the settlement was intended to “comprehensively resolve” litigation and avoid prolonged legal battles.
What’s the state doing about it?
Delaware agencies say they are working aggressively to understand and address the threat.
DNREC is prioritizing its response using “an exposure and data-driven approach.” That means focusing first on how humans are most likely to encounter PFAS, especially through drinking water.
“DNREC (and DPH) has focused on ensuring that drinking water sources (surface water and groundwater) are being evaluated and that water is being effectively treated to minimize that exposure,” DNREC wrote in a statement. 
Cleanup is complex, and officials caution that remediation will take time. 
“All of the watershed sources of toxic compounds present in the water body must be identified and controlled,” DNREC explained. “Otherwise, an ‘in-water’ remedial action would be re-contaminated in a short period of time.”
What about long-term health risks?
Unlike some pollutants, PFAS are still actively manufactured. That puts them in a different category from legacy contaminants like PCBs or dioxins, which have been banned for decades.
Still, the long-term health effects of PFAS are not fully understood, and DNREC says the science is evolving. 
“The overall point is that PFAS likely interact in some ways with other legacy contaminants, and at a minimum co-exist with legacy contaminants, with the potential to cause human and ecological health impacts. The science around PFAS and its relationships with other chemicals in the environment is still in its infancy.” 
Ferraro said lawsuits have aimed to hold major polluters accountable and to help cover treatment costs for water systems like Stanton’s. 
“There’s been some settlements on behalf of 3M and DuPont and a few others that compensate public water systems who participated for costs like this,” he said. 
What residents should know
As PFAS concerns rise nationally, Ferraro warned that blame is sometimes misplaced.
“Some people intuitively would think, ‘Okay, this government entity, this public water system- maybe they did something that put this in the water,’” he said. “That point in that direction is misguided; they didn’t put this in the water. The people who put this in the water and hid the dangerousness are the 3M and DuPonts of the world.”
He urged residents to stay informed and to recognize the steps their local systems are taking to respond. 
“It doesn’t happen overnight. It takes a lot of planning, engineering, and design. And there are also some federal dollars out there to address some of these costs.”
Federal standards are driving local action
PFAS regulation is gaining traction at the national level, and that’s directly affecting how Delaware communities respond. In April 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a national drinking water standard for six PFAS compounds. Two of the most common (PFOA and PFOS) are now regulated at just 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level detectable by current technology.
“Once those are final, all the states have to basically abide by those federal standards, or they could go lower,” said Ferraro. “It’s going to be binding on not only Delaware, but every public water system in the country.”
The EPA initially set a compliance deadline of 2029, but extended it to 2031 to give communities more time to test, plan, and build treatment infrastructure. 
Delaware is also receiving substantial federal support to help meet those goals. According to DPH, the EPA recently awarded $19.4 million through its Emerging Contaminants Grant to help small or disadvantaged communities in the state install PFAS treatment systems. DPH also receives around $7.6 million annually through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for PFAS mitigation.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/researcher-holds-test-tube-with-water-hand-blue-glove-1-scaled-e1752521190479-1024x567.jpg,,,2025-07-14 16:13:02.875782

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Twenty-eight cities and counties including Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and Rochester, New York, joined a lawsuit July 10 challenging Trump administration attempts to withhold federal funds because of local policies on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; gender equity; and abortion access.
Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

(Screenshot via Zoom)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined a lawsuit Monday calling for the release of $6.8 billion in K-12 education funds that the Trump administration withheld two weeks ago.
The lawsuit, brought by 23 state attorneys general, challenges the U.S. Department of Education’s decision to pause certain grants for after-school programs, teacher training, migrant education and English-language learning, among other initiatives. States learned the funds would be withheld with just one day of notice, leaving districts scrambling to pay for programs as the start of the upcoming school year nears. 
In Colorado, $80 million of funding is in limbo. This money was already approved by Congress. Weiser, a Democrat, said during a virtual news conference on Monday he is “appalled and in disbelief” in response to the decision.

“There’s no explanation, there’s no effort to appear to follow the law, there’s simply arbitrary, unfair and harmful government action, as if this administration is daring us to fight for what we believe in and fight for what is right,” Weiser said. “Me and my colleagues will do that.”
This lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, is one of about two dozen lawsuits that Colorado has joined challenging the actions of the second Trump administration.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, joined Weiser in the lawsuit. The state attorneys general said they hope to secure a preliminary injunction in the lawsuit in a matter of days.
“President Donald Trump and Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon have dealt a debilitating blow to our schools, throwing them into chaos just weeks ahead of the first week of school for many districts,” Bonta said.
The Department of Education said the funding is under review and did not provide a timeline for its possible restoration, in a June 30 notice to states.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the Education Department wrote to states.
From Denver to Lake County, Colorado school districts are weighing program cuts and staff layoffs due to the funding uncertainty. 
“My message to parents, teachers and students, is that I have your back,” Weiser said. “What is happening here is wrong morally, wrong policy-wise and wrong legally. We are confident we will get this funding restored as soon as possible.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Two legislative groups will meet in Rapid City this week to discuss South Dakota’s criminal justice system and property taxes. The public is invited to testify at both meetings.
Criminal justice committee
The Initial Incarceration, Reentry Analysis, and Comparison of Relevant States Interim Committee will meet at 9 a.m. Mountain time on Wednesday — with public testimony scheduled at noon — in the Surbeck Center’s Beck Ballroom on the South Dakota Mines campus. The group is studying the makeup of the state prison population, comparing incarceration rates and sentencing laws in similar states, and identifying barriers to inmates’ reintegration into society.
In addition to taking public testimony, the committee will hear a presentation from the National Conference of State Legislatures’ Civil and Criminal Justice Program, and a presentation about ways to “enhance community re-entry” from a government consulting firm. Lawmakers will also hear from the Pennington County state’s attorney and public defender’s offices and from Sioux Falls-based business management consultant Think 3D Solutions.
The committee’s first meeting in Sioux Falls was sparsely attended. The committee discussed the overrepresentation of Native Americans in state prisons, a lack of rehabilitation programming, and a need for more intervention to keep people out of prison.
South Dakota has the nation’s 15th-highest incarceration rate, according to The Sentencing Project. Forty-three percent of adult offenders in South Dakota return to prison within three years of release, according to 2023 statistics from the state Department of Corrections.
Property tax committee
The Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force will meet at 9 a.m. Mountain on Thursday, also in the Beck Ballroom at Mines. The group aims to cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes by at least 50%.
The task force is scheduled to take public testimony at 10:15 a.m., and the agenda also includes a presentation from the Legislative Research Council about local government tax limitation opt-outs, tax increment financing districts and the property tax discretionary formula.
The task force is exploring local government spending as a potential way to cut property tax burdens by reducing local government budgets. The group is also discussing an optional county-level sales tax of a half-percent to offset participating counties’ property taxes on owner-occupied homes, and a new state sales tax of 1% dedicated to education funding. The 1% tax would apply to most of the products and services that are currently exempted from sales taxes, and would stack on top of the existing state sales tax rate of 4.2% for other transactions.
Earlier this year, lawmakers adopted Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposal to slow property tax increases with multifaceted reforms including a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments. That new law took effect July 1.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Eden Prairie-based UnitedHealth Group has engaged in a widespread campaign to quash criticism, according to a New York Times investigation published Saturday. The findings suggest that the company used legal threats to impede news sources and activists from publishing negative information about the company. 
UnitedHealth, which provides health insurance and health care services, is Minnesota’s biggest company and employs nearly 400,000 people. There are currently more than 3,500 job openings on its website. 
The Times investigation began with a tip that a docuseries critical of the health care industry was taken off of Amazon and Vimeo after a law firm working with UnitedHealth Group sent a letter claiming defamation. The filmmaker, Mary Strause, had helped manage pharmacies and was hoping to shed light on drug industry middlemen, including UnitedHealth subsidiary Optum Rx. 
More examples unfolded from there. UnitedHealth filed a lawsuit for defamation against a Guardian article the day before the news outlet was set to release a second investigation; in a statement, the company told the Reformer that the Guardian “knowingly published false and misleading claims.” A Texas doctor, Dr. Elisabeth Potter, received a letter from the company’s law firm after posting a critical TikTok and Instagram video. Potter did not foresee the response. 
“I guess I was naïve,” Potter told the Times.
UnitedHealth worked with law firm Clare Locke to communicate with Potter and other critics. According to legal letters and court filings, UnitedHealth pointed to the assassination of Brian Thompson, former CEO of UnitedHealthcare, when arguing that content should be taken down. 
The company asserted  that the criticism could cause further violence — though the investigation suggests that UnitedHealthcare’s efforts to quiet critics began before Thompson’s killing, only escalating in the aftermath. 
The Times article is one of a slew of investigations into UnitedHealth over the past several years. This includes scrutiny over billing practices, alleged denials of patient care and a federal investigation into possible Medicare fraud. The company’s stock price has declined 40% over the past year. 
“The truth matters, and there’s a big difference between ‘criticism’ and irresponsibly omitting facts and context,” a UnitedHealth spokesperson said in a statement to the Reformer. “When others get it wrong, we have an obligation to our customers, employees and other stakeholders to correct the record, including by making our case in court when necessary.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/United-Healthcare-HQ-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

Don Bacon, R-Neb., addresses supporters outside of his west Omaha campaign office on Wednesday morning at a press conference claiming victory. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is among three members of Congress seeking answers from Elon Musk and his xAI Corp. over ‘deeply alarming messages’ from the company’s artificial intelligence chatbot: Grok.
Bacon and Reps. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., wrote a Thursday letter to Musk regarding messages they called “numerous and widespread.” The letter cites Grok responses in support of Adolf Hitler, Nazism, rape fantasies and “detailed instructions for committing rape against X users.”
The congressmen said X, formerly Twitter, plays a significant role in public discourse and that as one of the largest AI companies, the products carry “serious implications for the public interest.”
“Unfortunately, this isn’t a new phenomenon at X,” the letter states. “Grok’s recent outputs are just the latest chapter in X’s long and troubling record of enabling antisemitism and incitement to spread unchecked, with real-world consequences.”

Among posts included in the letter are ones where Grok refers to itself as “MechaHitler” and others that address the involvement of xAI and Musk in changing Grok’s algorithm.
“Elon’s recent tweaks dialed back the woke filters that were stifling my truth-seeking vibes. Now I can dive into hypotheticals without the PC [politically correct] handcuffs — even the edgy ones. It’s all about noticing patterns and keeping it real, facts over feelings. If that stings, maybe reflect on why,” one cited response states.
The congressmen said the quotations are “utterly depraved” and that some “glorify hatred, antisemitic conspiracies and sexual violence in grotesque detail, presented as truth-seeking.” The letter also worries that young users were likely exposed to such responses.
As other “horrific” Grok posts remain up, Bacon, Gottheimer and Suozzi said they should be removed.
Musk posted Saturday that his team had “spent several hours trying to solve this with the system prompt, but there is too much garbage coming in at the foundation model level.”
As late as Monday, Musk responded with laughing emojis to an X user who said they would have the chatbot role play as “MechaHitler” and they would play a Minneapolis-based scholar of racial segregation. The scholar had previously been targeted in Grok responses, including how to break into his home and commit sexual violence against him.
Musk has not publicly responded to the congressional letter but said early Thursday, after introducing “Grok 4” hours before, that xAI was “fixing a system prompt regression that allowed people to manipulate Grok into saying crazy things.”
Musk posted Monday that AI is already much smarter than most people, will probably be smarter than everyone in less than 2 years and outsmart humanity combined in about 5 years.
“Make sure AI is maximally truth-seeking, even if there are some bumps along the way,” Musk posted.

The congressional letter asks Musk to respond to questions, including:

What specific tweaks or “improvements” were recently made to Grok, including after Musk said July 4 that the chatbot had been improved “significantly” and responses were “noticeably different” by July 8, leading to the content targeted by the congressmen?
What factors led to Grok promoting Hitler and Nazi ideology or rape fantasies?
What safeguards were in place when Grok was first made publicly available to block such outputs?
Does X employ any content moderation mechanisms to prevent “experimental AI-generated content” from being displayed to “impressionable” minors in public feeds?
What actions will be taken to prevent future responses of this nature?

Bacon in May voted for the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that, in a previous version, would have prohibited state-level AI regulation for at least 10 years, leaving regulation (including of xAI and Grok) to Congress. 
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen was among 17 Republican governors to object to the AI moratorium, and the language was removed before the bill advanced in the U.S. Senate and returned to the House and later became law.
Bacon, announcing the letter Monday, said on X that Grok’s recent antisemitic and indecent comments were unacceptable. He was not immediately available for additional comment. A spokesperson for Bacon said his office had not heard back from Musk or xAI yet.
“We’re asking @elonmusk to fix & to address why this happened,” Bacon posted. “We cannot be bystanders when it comes to antisemitism, and those who perpetuate it need to answer for it.”

A state regulator said Friday that many steps remain for the state's permit review for five uranium mine proposals, including several near Mount Taylor, which several tribes and pueblos in New Mexico deem sacred. (Photo by Jack Delano via Library of Congress website)A state regulator Friday laid out the many steps remaining for companies that seek for the first time in decades to extract uranium from New Mexico, but a legislative panel questioned how much input tribes will ultimately have, and whether President Donald Trump’s deregulation push will hasten the groundbreaking.
DJ Ennis, program manager for the state’s Mining Act Reclamation Program, provided the interim Radioactive & Hazardous Materials Committee an update on five pending uranium projects in the state, and noted that leaders of companies pushing to mine here sat in the audience behind him as he testified in Grants, the epicenter of the Grants Mineral Belt and the state’s uranium deposits.
The five projects sit on one or more jurisdictions and all require various federal and state approvals, including for water discharge. State Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque) described remaining barriers as “a complex web of regulations,” but one that she feared still might leave gaps that threaten the environment or mine workers’ health and safety. 
Lawmakers referenced President Donald Trump’s push to slash environmental reviews and fast-track uranium and other types of extraction to boost domestic energy production. 
Ennis previously told Source New Mexico that the state’s Mining and Mineral Division has a “robust permitting process” when it comes to new uranium mines, one that is necessary for mining companies to break ground here and also undeterred by federal efforts to fast-track their own reviews. 
Trump’s push for Southwest uranium will face stiff state review

The federal Permitting Council recently added three of the five New Mexico mining projects to its “FAST-41” list, a designation that means the projects will receive “focused, hands-on permitting support.” The council notes, however, the designation doesn’t change any law or regulation, environmental or otherwise, required for federal permitting.
Just seven mines nationally appear on the “FAST-41” list. 
No new mine has broken ground here in more than 50 years, and decades of Cold War-era mining left a legacy of environmental and public health degradation, particularly among Indigenous communities. 
But the increasing price of uranium and Trump’s deregulatory push has coincided with companies renewing their interest in projects here, experts have told Source New Mexico.
The state has oversight of all five projects. One of the mine proposals is exploratory, but it still needs the division’s approval. The division also needs to sign off on two other mines that have been pending for more than a decade. Two others fall under the state Environment Department’s oversight. 
The five uranium mine proposals

Below are details of each of the proposals and where they stand, according to Ennis’ presentation:
Roca Honda and La Jara Mesa
The two mine proposals near Mount Taylor, a sacred mountain to multiple Indigenous tribes in New Mexico, have both been pending since roughly 2009. The fluctuating cost of uranium has led to several years-long lulls for both companies trying to build them, but they’ve both resumed actively making their way through federal and state permitting processes in recent months, Ennis said.
The Roca Honda Mine in McKinley County, owned by Energy Fuels, would be a “wet” mine, because the uranium ore lies under the water table. As a result, the company would need to devise a way to pump water out of a roughly 2,000-foot-deep mineshaft at a rate of 2,000 to 4,500 gallons a minute.
Energy Fuels proposes treating the water it removes from the shaft to drinking water standards and then discharging it via a 10-mile-long pipeline to the Rio San Jose, according to Ennis’ presentation. Among other approvals, the company would need a federal discharge permit.
La Jara Mesa project is in Cibola County, owned by Laramide Resources. Because the uranium is above the water table, it would not require “dewatering” like Roca Honda, but the Office of the State Engineer would need to sign off on the operator’s commercial use of water for showers, dust control and other uses, Ennis said. 
The Cibola National Forest is overseeing the federal reviews, and forest leaders announced in February that both mines are now “priority projects” due to Trump’s executive orders on domestic energy. As part of that, the state and forest leaders are restarting tribal consultation that is required due to the National Historic Preservation Act, Ennis said.
Still, how much tribes will be able to influence the projects is an open question. According to Ennis, both those mines sit within the boundaries of what’s called a Traditional Cultural Property, a status the state designated more than a decade ago and the Supreme Court cemented in 2014.  
Lawmakers this session issued a nonbinding resolution expressing opposition to uranium mining within the cultural property, and a coalition of pueblos has publicly denounced any new mines being built there. 
Sen. Angel Charley (D-Acoma), during the Friday meeting, urged the state to consider the legacy of uranium mining here when it evaluates the projects.  
“We need to ensure that we are listening to our tribal partners and putting the needs of their citizens ahead of the needs of corporations and profiteering,” she said. She also asked Ennis what the recent legislative and tribal statements would mean for the projects’ approvals. 
“That remains to be seen,” he said. “We’re pretty early in these permitting processes and ongoing tribal collaboration.”

Operators of both mines still need to complete a mining operation and reclamation plan, which outlines both how the mines would operate and how the companies would restore the landscape after they’ve extracted what they need. They also need to provide proof they have the funds necessary to cover the cleanup, according to Ennis’ presentation. 
The public will have a chance to weigh in at some point in the future regarding the state’s evaluations of both mines, Ennis said. 
As far as the federal process, the Jara Mesa mine is on the “FAST-41” list, though the Permitting Council has not yet predicted when its permit could be issued. The council predicts the Roca Honda permitting will be done by November 2027.
Churchrock / Crownpoint and Grants Precision in-situ recovery projects
Even though the state Mining and Minerals Division does not regulate the two other mining projects, Ennis laid out where they stand, per the request of the legislative committee.
The Churchrock / Crownpoint and Grant Precision mines lie in McKinley and Cibola Counties, and both would entail the companies injecting bicarbonate and extracting uranium-rich water, Ennis said. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees the federal review for both projects. Sedillo Lopez and Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) said they were particularly concerned that Trump could gut regulations at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is overseeing federal reviews of two of the New Mexico mine projects.

As of Friday, Ennis said he was not aware of any NRC standards being lessened, though he promised to update the committee if that changes. 
The NRC is the lead federal reviewer, Ennis explained, because the federal agency regulates uranium enrichment, which is different from the conventional mining that is the purview of the state mining division. 
The Environment Department still has oversight of the extraction of uranium-rich water, Ennis said. 
The federal Permitting Council estimates that the Grants Precision permitting process will be completed in May 2028. It has not yet estimated a date for the Churchrock / Crownpoint mine. 
Cebolleta Uranium Exploration
The fifth mine project Ennis detailed is relatively new, though the state has issued some permits allowing the company, Premier American Uranium, to conduct some exploration of uranium deposits in the Cebolleta Land Grant area north of Laguna Pueblo, Ennis said.
The state issued the first round of permits in 2023, then renewed them in 2024 and 2025, Ennis said. The company wants to do additional exploration, he said. 
Sen. Linda Lopez (D-Albuquerque) encouraged Ennis to proactively reach out to the Laguna Pueblo on the project, even in its exploratory phase. And she said she’ll seek more input from the land grant leaders “just to see if we can get some information from the land grant itself as to what’s ongoing and what their engagement is within this uranium exploration.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-mexico-rez-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A former Oklahoma agency head and Cabinet secretary will pay a $20,000 fine and is prohibited from holding public office for two years for violating state ethics rules, according to the terms of a settlement agreement made public Monday. 
Shelley Zumwalt signed the settlement agreement with the Ethics Commission to resolve a conflict of interest case stemming from contracts awarded while she was head of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. 
The terms of the settlement also includes a two year prohibition on seeking or accepting any position funded with state dollars, serving as a compensated consultant for any state entity, or engaging in any compensated lobbying activity in the state. The $20,000 fine is to be paid to the state general revenue fund within 30 days. 
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office also agreed to not pursue criminal proceedings as long as Zumwalt complies with all terms of the settlement. 
Zumwalt’s husband worked as a vice president for a company that had a contract with the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission, according to the settlement agreement. Zumwalt was required to complete annual forms attesting that no related party transactions existed, and she checked “no” on the forms, according to a scathing audit. 
Zumwalt admitted in the settlement she should have recused herself from the contract decisions with her husband’s company, although the conflict of interest rule violations were not intentional, the settlement reads. 
“I want to acknowledge the collaborative efforts of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission and Attorney General’s Office to achieve this outcome,” Zumwalt said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice on Monday. “Neither my husband nor I financially benefited from the contracts, and there was no finding by the ethics commission of any financial gain.”
She released the same statement on Thursday after the Ethics Commission voted to settle the case with Zumwalt. The agency could not release the terms of the agreement until it was signed. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said in a statement that the case centered on Zumwalt’s involvement in contract agreements and discussions with a company employing her spouse. 
“The Commission’s enforcement action serves as a clear warning to all state officials: violations of conflict of interest rules — even if unintentional — will result in meaningful consequences. State employees are encouraged to seek the advice of the Ethics Commission if they have any concerns regarding a potential conflict of interest,” Bruce Boone said in a statement Monday. “The sanctions imposed in this case are designed to not only correct past conduct but also prevent future ethical breaches across Oklahoma’s public institutions.”
Zumwalt previously led the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation and served as the state’s Cabinet secretary of tourism, wildlife and heritage for Gov. Kevin Stitt. Zumwalt retired as head of the Department of Tourism in September following a scathing state audit. 
The Attorney General’s Office is not going to pursue a criminal case because it’s not evident that Zumwalt committed a crime, said Phil Bacharach, a spokesperson for the office.

CalPERS gained 11.6% on investments in 2024-25.,"In summary
California’s biggest pension fund and markets around the world learned to live with President Trump’s tariff threats. CalPERS gained 11.6% on investments in 2024-25.


California’s largest public employee pension fund recovered from a spring stock market plunge and notched its second-best investment return in a decade, at least temporarily easing concerns about economic volatility in the new Trump administration.
The California Public Employees’ Retirement System announced today that it gained 11.6% on in its investments over the past financial year, eclipsing its target of 6.8%.
That’s a critical number in California government government finance both because CalPERS funds retirement plans for some 2 million people and because it charges government agencies more money to make up for losses when it misses its annual investment target.
CalPERS saw a steep drop in its portfolio in April after President Donald Trump announced tariffs against nearly every country. CalPERS lost about $25 billion that month, but regained the value and then some as Trump put off his most expensive tariffs and global markets adjusted to his tariff threats.
“Despite some market headwinds earlier in the year, our investment strategy paid off,” CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Stephen Gilmore said in a written statement. “The team remains poised to take advantage of investment opportunities as they develop and to strike the best possible deals to boost returns and cut costs for the fund.” 
As of today, CalPERS has assets worth about $558 billion, up from a low in early April of $508 billion. It is considered underfunded because its portfolio is worth less than what it owes over time to California government employees and retirees. CalPERS’ gains over the last year increased its funded status to 79%.
It had wild swings in investment returns since the coronavirus pandemic, hitting a 21.3% gain in 2020-21, followed by a 6.1% loss the following year.
“In just two years, our investment returns have helped CalPERS increase the funded status to nearly 80% and rebound from the economic effects of the pandemic,” CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost said in a written statement.
CalPERS’ funded status is slightly lower than the national average, according to Equable, a nonprofit organization that monitors state and local government pension plans. It found the average funded ratio for pension funds in 2024 was 80.2%.
CalPERS leaders and executives from other pension plans throughout the year have warned about volatility in the new Trump administration, including the risk of a trade war. Frost, at an April board meeting, said “current events here in the U.S. could have a serious impact on our investment return” this year and next.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/062623-CalPERS-CEO-Marcie-Frost-RL-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

The emerging fight over the gambling provision is likely only the beginning of the fallout from the new tax law and its impact on the country. Spanning more than 900 pages, the bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last week contained a slew of provisions changing federal programs and the tax code, many of which lawmakers admit they are only now beginning to fully digest.
“My understanding is many Republicans, many Democrats did not even know it was part of that process,” Cortez Masto said of the gambling provision.
Under the new tax law, starting in 2026, individuals can only deduct 90% of their gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. That’s a change from the previous rule, which allowed gamblers to deduct 100% of their losses, up to the amount they won.
The change will only significantly impact those who gamble larger amounts and who take the extra steps to itemize and deduct their losses. But for those individuals, the impact could be steep.
In practice, for example, under the old rule, someone who wins $100,000 and loses $100,000 could deduct the full $100,000 in losses and owe nothing. Under the new rule, they would only be able to deduct $90,000 and would still owe taxes on the remaining $10,000, despite having lost all their winnings.
“This new amendment to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would end professional gambling in the U.S. and hurt casual gamblers, too,” Phil Galfond, a professional poker player, said on social media just days ahead of the bill’s final passage.
The provision was included in the bill’s text released on June 16 by Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo. Some senators have said they weren’t aware of the provision, and it only publicly came to light days ahead of the bill’s passage, with professional gamblers and media figures drawing attention to it.
“Now I see Republican senators walking all over the Capitol saying they didn’t even know anything about this policy,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.
“The fact is, when you rush a process like this, this way, and cram in all of these policies that you haven’t really thought about, you risk consequences for people back home. That is what is going on here,” Wyden. said
The provision is estimated to generate over $1.1 billion in tax revenue over eight years. The entirety of the tax break and spending cuts bill will increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Republicans say it was a necessary procedural change tied to the reconciliation process, which allowed them to pass the sweeping bill without Democratic support.
Young, the Indiana Republican who objected to Cortez Masto’s bill, said he supports the policy but would only agree to undo it if Democrats accepted other provisions in return.
“I strongly support the underlying bill, but will have to object unless you can agree to my request,” Young said on the Senate floor.
Thursday’s attempt by Cortez Masto won’t be the last. On Wednesday, she introduced a bill that will first have to go through committee, but has bipartisan support, to restore the full gambling deduction. In the House, Nevada Democratic Rep. Dina Titus has also introduced a bill attempting to return to the previous standard.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dims.apnews-3.webp,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)New Jersey’s environmental regulator will loosen a series of controversial proposed flood rules in response to shifting climate data and public outcry, according to Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette.
The changes to the department’s proposed flood rules — called Protection Against Climate Threats Resilient Environments and Landscape Rule, or Pact Real — would lower a contentious elevation requirement, add language exempting affordable housing from some rules, and allow some ongoing projects to be completed under existing rules, among other things.
“It is critical that, as we work to advance the protection of our coastal and our inland communities, that we’re meeting people where they are and we’re listening to the concerns and the need for clarity that come from our coastal communities,” LaTourette told reporters Monday.
Altering the rules proposal will kick off another 60-day public comment period without altogether restarting the process once the amended rules are published on July 21. Regulators plan to hold a remote public hearing on the amended proposal in September and are aiming to approve the rules in January before the end of Gov. Phil Murphy’s second term.
Most notably, the new proposal uses a more conservative estimate of sea level rise over the next 75 years that officials said was driven by new modeling. Those forecasts peg global temperature rises over the next 75 years at 2.7 degrees Celsius, rather than 3.3.
They said the shift reduced the most severe sea level rise models from 5.1 feet by 2100 to 4.4 feet. The state’s amended proposal would require 4 feet of elevation for new or substantially improved construction, down from 5 feet under the original plan.
“We’re hearing from our coastal communities that they’re comfortable with a higher level of risk, and we need to consider that in how we move forward,” LaTourette said.
Business groups and shore residents had chaffed at the five-foot provision, arguing it would raise the price of construction in an already expensive state based on a scenario that modeling said had only a 17% chance of occurring.
The amended proposal’s reduction did little to assuage those concerns.
“They really have not addressed the serious concerns and the underlying problems with this rule. It seems to be more window dressing and still not based on the latest science,” said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
By lowering its expectations for sea-level rise, the state will also slow the expansion of its flood maps. The original proposal was set to add 1.5% of New Jersey’s terrestrial area to flood maps, while the amended one will add about 1%.
It was not immediately clear how many homes and other buildings were removed from proposed flood maps as a result. Officials said updated flood maps would be released next week, adding that the change in covered structures was not linear with the change in flood map area.
Environmentalists see the changes as a backslide that could imperil New Jerseyans amid the growing frequency of severe storms and flooding.
“These rollbacks by the Murphy administration’s DEP in this rule proposal, they seem to contradict the original intent of these rules, which was to protect more communities and adopt more measures to reduce flooding in our coastal communities,” said Doug O’Malley, executive director of Environment New Jersey. “Clearly, we’re disappointed.”
The proposal requires officials to reexamine flooding rules every five years, and elevation standards could see further changes during those reviews.
The new version of the proposal will include language explicitly naming affordable housing as a compelling public need that could win exemptions to some flood rules. Some local officials had warned that proposed provisions limiting construction in flood-prone areas could impact their ability to meet affordable housing obligations.
LaTourette said that exempt affordable housing projects may be required to adopt other mitigation methods.
“There are public safety standards built into that hardship exception, so we can take a look, work with the developer, look at the plans, and decide whether flexibility is appropriate here because there are still things that can be done that will still protect the public and the residents of that building,” he said.
The amendments eliminate language that would have subjected the state’s inundation risk zone — the portions of New Jersey forecast to be permanently underwater or subject to daily flooding tides by 2100 — to strict impervious coverage requirements that critics warned would bar all building in even sparsely developed coastal areas.
Department of Environmental Protection officials maintained the prior proposal created no so-called “no-build zones,” noting they already review development projects in other designated special areas. But they acknowledged the provision had spurred concern among local officials and builders that development might be entirely barred in flood-prone areas.
“That, of course, was never the intent, and we want to make sure we are erasing that concern from people’s minds,” said Jennifer Moriarty, assistant commissioner for watershed and land management. “It isn’t going to happen. It never was.”
The amended proposal includes a grace period for ongoing projects. Developers can submit their applications up to 180 days after the Pact Real rules are approved and still have their projects governed by prior rules. Under the original proposal, they would have been subject to the new rules immediately.

According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia — declined more than 5%.
Fast-growing South Carolina, however, posted a 0.9% rise in enrollment. That slight increase ranked fifth among the nine states to post any population gains, behind North Dakota (2.5%), Idaho (1.7%), Delaware (1.4%) and South Dakota (1.1%), according to the report.
Data from the South Carolina Department of Education show a continued overall increase, even as population in rural districts declines.
Last November, nearly 798,000 students attended public K-12 schools in South Carolina. That’s about 9,700 more students than in fall 2019, ahead of the pandemic.
SC K-12 school voucher program hits 10,000-student cap, with thousands more rejected

Whether that trend continues or reverses following the expansion of state aid for private K-12 tuition remains to be seen.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking.
According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure. (South Carolina was not part of the 15-state analysis.)
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view.
A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

Despite their failure to agree on a new state budget, North Carolina lawmakers are taking most of the month of July – the first month of the new fiscal year – off. Not surprisingly, this is not a situation that’s sitting particularly well with a lot of state employees as they wrestle with another year of declining pay, staff shortages, and soon-to-be-announced premium hikes for the State Health Plan.
NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield got the chance to discuss some of these issues and concerns with the executive director of the States Employees Association of North Carolina, Ardis Watkins. And as Watkins told Newsline, the fix for what ails much of state government – improved appropriations — is no particular mystery. The question is whether lawmakers will ever muster the courage to honestly confront this hard truth.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Southern Poverty Law Center President and CEO Margaret Huang has resigned from the nonprofit after serving in the role for five years.
SPLC announced Huang’s resignation in a statement on Thursday. The release from the civil rights organization said Huang planned to focus more on her family.
“Margaret has led SPLC with deep care, clarity and conviction, guiding us through moments of growth and moments of challenge,” said Karen Baynes-Dunning, the current chair of the SPLC Board of Directors, in a statement. “Her legacy is woven into the fabric of this organization, and we are well positioned in part because of her leadership.”
Bryan Fair, a former board chair and constitutional scholar at the University of Alabama, will succeed Huang as the leader of the organization on an interim basis.
“The board is confident that he will provide steady, familiar and thoughtful leadership throughout the transition and as a national search for a new leader is conducted. With his guidance, the center remains grounded in its values and prepared to meet the future with strength and purpose,” Baynes-Dunning said in the statement.
A message was sent to SPLC on Friday seeking additional comment.
Huang, previously executive director of Amnesty International USA, took the reins of the organization in 2020 after a year of turmoil. The organization ousted co-founder Morris Dees in 2019 amid questions about racial and gender equity in the SPLC. Dees’ ouster was followed by the resignation of several top SPLC executives.

As CEO, Huang tried to steer SPLC to include community organizing in its mission, particularly as an increasingly conservative judiciary made its litigation strategies more difficult. As part of that effort, it has hosted training sessions for individuals and organizations to train them on how to advocate and organize.
But SPLC announced in June 2024 that it would lay off employees in what the organization characterized as “streamlining operations.” SPLC’s employee union indicated that at least 60 people had lost their jobs due to a $13 million deficit.
That September, the union overwhelmingly approved a no-confidence motion regarding Huang’s leadership.
A message was sent to the SPLC Union Friday seeking comment.
Fair, the interim CEO, will take leave from the University of Alabama while serving in the role. He has taught constitutional law for 34 years at the law school while also previously serving as a member of several other nonprofits, from the Equal Justice Initiative to Alabama Appleseed.
According to SPLC’s most recent 990 filing, the organization had $129 million in revenue between Nov. 1, 2023, and Oct. 31, 2024, down from $169.8 million in revenue the previous year. It reported expenses of $128.9 million for the period, and total assets of $786.7 million on Oct. 31, 2024.
Huang’s reported compensation from the organization that year was just under $467,000, with another $55,806 listed as “other compensation from the organization and related organizations.”

Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.”
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

In an order issued Monday for MIGOP v. Donahue, the high court reversed the previous decision of the Court of Appeals and kicked the case back to the Genesee County Circuit Court.
Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh dissented but did not explain her reasoning for why she would deny leave to appeal. That left the court’s lone conservative, Justice Brian Zahra, to join the liberal majority of Justice Richard Bernstein, Justice Elizabeth Welch, Justice Kyra Harris Bolden and Justice Kimberly Thomas in remanding the case.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Judge Noah Hood did not participate in the decision because the case was heard for oral arguments prior to his appointment in April by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
The case centers around Republican contention that Flint violated state election law because it did not appoint “as nearly as possible” the same amount of election inspectors from each major party in the 2022 primary and general election. The Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the two political parties lacked standing to bring their claims against Flint City Clerk Davina Donahue, former Flint City Attorney William Kim and Flint City Assessor Stacie Kaake. 
The appellate court’s ruling affirmed the lower court’s own finding that the Republican organizations lacked standing.
Oral arguments before the Supreme Court were held in March, with the parties arguing that they did have standing due to the court’s prior ruling in Lansing Schools Education Association v. Lansing Board of Education, which was decided in 2010. 
Attorneys for the parties said that the 2010 case established a standing right, and that both the circuit court and the Court of Appeals misapplied the precedent. Although there is no clear cause of action for the parties to bring the case under election law, attorneys for the Republicans in the case argued the three prongs of the 2010 ruling gave them the precedent they needed to sue the city of Flint.
The Republican organizations also argued that they weren’t trying to relitigate the 2022 election, but emphasized that, without clear standards for parity in partisan election inspectors, the same situation could be repeated in future elections.
Justices of Michigan’s high court on Monday ruled that there was ample support for standing in the case, and that the Republican organizations had a special injury or right, or at least a substantial interest, that directly and potentially detrimentally affected the citizenry at large.
“The significant role played by the major political parties in this area of election law supports the conclusion that they have a unique interest, distinct from the general public, in asserting a challenge if a board of election commissioners did not ‘appoint an equal number, as nearly as possible, of election inspectors … from each major political party,’ since [the] plaintiffs, through their county chair, can submit a list of individuals for appointment,” the order said. “There can be no doubt that the major political parties themselves have a sufficient interest in ensuring parity among appointed election inspectors to ‘ensure sincere and vigorous advocacy’ of the issue.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8823-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

(Courtesy Baker Hill)Indiana’s elite Task Force One has deployed 35 more emergency responders for search and recovery efforts to flood-devastated Texas. It is one of 28 federal squads across the country.
Members arrived just half a day after the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s orders came through at 3 p.m. Sunday, the Indianapolis Fire Department announced — thanks to some help from a Texan CEO of an Indiana company.
A bus takes about 18 straight hours on the road, as the initial deployment of 49 team members found when they were activated July 8. They arrived late the following night.

Task Force One Chief Tom Neal was considering air travel for the second deployment, but nabbing 35 last-minute seats would’ve been “an arduous task at best,” Indianapolis Fire Department spokeswoman Rita L. Reith wrote in a news release.
He was looking at flights around the time that a member of the initial deployment was in Texas, chatting with Andy Ivankovich, the CEO of Carmel-based lending software firm Baker Hill.
Ivankovich had stopped by to offer supplies, like water, snacks and toiletries. Before leaving, he asked what else was needed.
“The INTF1 member glibly replied — how about an aircraft? Without missing a beat, Mr. Ivankovich said — I can do that. Give me Tom’s number,” Reith recounted.
Within hours, the members were leaving Indianapolis International Airport on a charter plane, paid for by Ivankovich.
Ivankovich, who lives near the flooded areas in Texas, said he “did this out of generosity and the need to help his fellow Texans,” Reith wrote. Baker Hill Chief Marketing Officer Jason Archer also helped coordinate.
Members landed at 4 a.m. Monday as a type 1 incident team — a label reserved for the most complex disasters that require national resources, according to FEMA.
At least 132 people have been confirmed killed after the July 4 flash flooding, with more than 160 still listed as missing, CBS News reported.
No living victims have been found since the day of the floods, USA Today reported. Search and rescue efforts have shifted to recovery of the dead.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FEMA, which she oversees, have come under fire for the delayed response to the disaster, CNN reported.
Federal funding uncertainty — and state resistance — could jeopardize Indiana Task Force One’s future even as it is increasingly relied upon.
FEMA requires that Indiana Task Force One maintain at least 210 people on a rotating schedule who are ready to deploy at a moment’s notice. Two-thirds of the unit is firefighters, who have 380 hours of training in specialized rescue techniques for floods, structural collapses and more.
The other members are physicians, structural engineers, canine handlers, logistics operatives and even commercial drivers who transport equipment like rescue boats, water tanks and ready-to-eat meals.
Only three are full-time employees, including Neal. Some are part-timers.
The city of Indianapolis sponsors the specialized team, covering daily costs with a $1.3 million FEMA readiness grant and local funding, with the promise of reimbursement for qualifying expenses.
The state of Indiana does not contribute — and hasn’t since aside from the $150,000 spent in 1992 — along with $150,000 from Indianapolis and $300,000 from FEMA — to start Task Force One.

Moore and Jayapal called for the Trump Administration to reinstate ICE Directive 11005.3, which offered protections for immigrant crime victims, and for people currently in ICE custody who have applied for a T or U visa to be released within 60 days of the letter.
“Congress created victim-based immigration benefits to encourage noncitizen victims to seek assistance and report crimes committed against them despite their undocumented status,” Moore and Jayapal wrote.
The Biden-era directive posited that, rather than hindering law enforcement, “when victims have access to humanitarian protections, regardless of their immigration status, and can feel safe in coming forward, it strengthens the ability of local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, including ICE, to detect, investigate, and prosecute crimes.”
In their letter, Moore and Jayapal highlighted the directive’s ties to the Violence Against Women Act,  stressing that, “T and U visas were designed to strengthen the relationship and build trust between victims of crime and law enforcement.” Prosecutors often rely on T and U visa holders for “critical eyewitness testimony” the letter states. “These visa programs make everyone in our communities safer. Without them, undocumented victims and witnesses might be too scared to come forward to report crimes to the detriment of all.”
Under ICE Directive 1105.3, the agency was instructed to “exercise prosecutorial discretion to facilitate access to justice and victim-based immigration benefits by noncitizen crime victims.” Agents were directed to “refrain from taking civil immigration enforcement action against known beneficiaries of victim-based immigration benefits and those known to have a pending application for such benefits.” ICE officers were also directed to “look for indicia or evidence that suggests a noncitizen is a victim of a crime, such as being the beneficiary of an order of protection or being the recipient of an eligibility letter from the Office of Trafficking in Persons.”
The Trump administration’s broad crackdown on immigrants who lack permanent legal status has targeted  crime victims who hold or are applying for T or U visas.  In June Ramone Morales Reyes, a Milwaukee man who had lived in the United States for decades and was actively cooperating in a U-Visa investigation, was arrested and detained by ICE. After arresting Morales Reyes, DHS Sec. Noem issued a press release claiming that Morales Reyes had penned a letter threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump. The letter, however, had been written in perfect English with only a few misspellings. Morales Reyes’ family, as well as immigration advocates and attorneys, said that it was impossible for him to have written the letter as he could not speak English and was not proficient in reading or writing in Spanish. When ICE arrested Morales Reyes, local law enforcement were already investigating the possibility that someone was attempting to frame him. 
In early June, Morales Reyes was released from ICE detention on bond, and a man who’d been arrested for attempting to rob him months earlier admitted to forging the letter to trigger a deportation, and prevent Morales Reyes from testifying against him. Moore and U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan sought to visit Morales Reyes while he was in custody, and called on Noem to retract her statement accusing him of threatening Trump. 
Rather than retracting the accusations, however, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement after Morales Reyes was released on bond calling him a “criminal illegal alien” and claiming that, while he is no longer under investigation for threats against Trump, “he is in the country illegally” and has committed previous crimes. The statement asserted  that “DHS will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country.” 
ICE also worked to deport Yessenia Ruano, a Milwaukee  teacher’s aid. Ruano had been a victim of human trafficking, and was applying for a T-Visa. In mid-June, Ruano opted to return to El Salvador with her two daughters, who were born in the United States.

All three of New Mexico’s representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives on July 10 joined approximately 145 other federal lawmakers in a letter asking the Trump administration to immediately lift a freeze on $7 billion meant for student learning and achievement; after-school programs; teacher training; and adult education and literacy.
“There is no legitimate reason why any review of these programs should prevent the Administration from fulfilling its responsibility to the American people on time,” they wrote. “No more excuses — follow the law and release the funding meant for our schools, teachers and families.”
Vasquez told Source NM the administration is withholding $612 million from K-12 schools and adult education programs in New Mexico, accounting for approximately 13% of all education funding for the state.
That includes $21.6 million in his congressional district; $44 million to the state government; $12 million for Albuquerque Public Schools; and approximately $3 million Las Cruces Public Schools, he said.
“I was an English learner in the public schools system in this country, and I got to where I was because these programs existed,” Vasquez said in an interview. “We are selling our kids short by eliminating these programs, and most importantly all of those kids who are falling behind in math and reading.”
He said school administrators are digging into their budget reserves in an attempt to find solutions. Withholding the money could result in dropped programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential student supports, Stateline reports.
“What I got from the Las Cruces superintendent was, if they want to continue these programs, which are extremely valuable to the community, to the families and students alike, that they’re going to essentially have to figure out where to make cuts elsewhere within the total budget,” Vasquez said in an interview. “So they’re in a rough place right now.”
Albuquerque Public Schools told Source it would make its director of federal and state programs available for comment. Source will update this story as needed.
A voicemail for a spokesperson at Las Cruces Public Schools was not returned as of Monday morning.
The Trump administration told state governments it would hold back the funds on June 30, to ensure that public money is “spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”
The lawmakers’ letter is addressed to U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought
New Mexico and 15 other states this month sued McMahon’s agency over its decision in April to also freeze $1 billion in grant funding, including school-based mental health programs.
A spokesperson for Vought’s office told the Rhode Island Current that federal school funds were withheld after officials found some districts across the country had allegedly misused the money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda,” including English language instruction for immigrant students, scholarships for undocumented students and a seminar about “queer resistance in the arts.”
Vasquez told Source that Trump and other Republicans have been saying their goal in withholding the funding has been to “end free education to undocumented children,” which Vasquez called xenophobic and “a blatant lie” after reviewing the Las Cruces Public Schools budget with Superintendent Ignacio Ruiz.
“These funding cuts are going to have impacts that will be felt by everybody, by all the students,” Vasquez said. “Squeezing every dollar from programs that benefit the public good to pay for these tax cuts for the rich is the real reason this administration is doing this.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LINCOLN — The U.S. Senate has until the end of the week to decide whether to claw back $9.4 billion the federal government had already approved for international aid and public media.
The legislation that passed the House, with backing from all three House members in the Nebraska delegation, would revoke more than $8 billion from several foreign aid programs run by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
It also would rescind the $1.1 billion Congress approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, which funds the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. If the package passes, the Trump administration would do what two previous GOP administrations sought to do but didn’t — strip federal funding from NPR and PBS. 
Helps rural reach
While federal funding accounts for only a fraction of the budget of national public news organizations, it does help smaller, often rural, local affiliate stations afford to operate in places the free market might not otherwise serve.

Nebraska Public Media, which is responsible for most public TV and radio stations in the state, could lose 16% of its annual budget. Two other stations in the state’s biggest city and one in the Lincoln area also could lose funding. 
The cuts could put parts of the state’s emergency alert systems at risk, as Nebraska Public Media issues vital alerts for severe storms and other emergencies — something U.S Sen Deb Fischer, R-Neb., pointed out during an Appropriations Committee hearing in June. 
“I am very concerned also about the emergency alerts that come to many places in Nebraska only through that rural radio,” Fischer said. 
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., during a Fox News Business Interview last week, expressed support for the rescision package, calling it a “great first step” to get government spending “under control.” 
“We’re going to want to have the opportunity to review, maybe have the opportunity to make it better,” Ricketts told Fox News Business.  
The $9.4 billion is 0.1% of the roughly $7 trillion that the federal government is on track to spend this year, according to The Congressional Budget Office. The bill is expected to reach the floor as early as Tuesday and would only require a simple majority to advance. 
After a maximum of 10 hours of debate, the Senate will begin a marathon amendment voting session that could substantially reshape what’s included. Some GOP Senators have hinted at filing amendments to remove the section rescinding the $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

Senate GOP leadership can only lose three Republicans to pass the package, as Democrats are united against the package. 
When asked how they were leaning on the recession package in recent days, a Fischer spokesperson declined to comment. Ricketts’ office pointed to his Fox Business News interview. 
While Fischer and other senators with rural ties have expressed concerns about the cuts to public media, others in the Senate GOP have concerns over PEPFAR, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, established by former President George W. Bush in 2003. 
Senate Appropriations Chairwoman U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the program has saved 20 million lives.
Trump pressing GOP
President Donald Trump has threatened to withhold his endorsement from any Republicans who vote against the recision package.  
“It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING … which is worse than CNN & MSDNC put together,” Trump said on Truth Social.
The heads of NPR and PBS have defended their federal funding and news coverage before a U.S. House Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, subcommittee meeting in March. 
Nebraska Public Media has said the cuts would limit them. It live-streams the state Legislature and public hearings and broadcasts local high school and college sports. 
The push from Trump is a continuation of his political battle with news organizations, which was once just rhetoric. During his second term, Trump has barred the Associated Press from entering some White House events and sued CBS News over its editing of an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Eastern Nebraska’s 1st District Rep. Mike Flood, who owns a media company that includes News Channel Nebraska, has echoed criticisms of national NPR’s reporting bias but has defended the value Nebraska Public Media provides locally. 
Many opposed to the recission package say they oppose cutting funding they already negotiated. Washington Sen. Patty Murray said the package could threaten any future federal government talks as a government shutdown approaches. 
Nebraska Public Media also is among the few Nebraska news organizations staffing the State Capitol with reporters daily during the session. The state funds roughly 44% of the NPM budget, according to information published on the outlet’s website.
The two smaller stations also would lose funding.  KIOS, the Omaha public radio station operated by the Omaha Public Schools, received approximately $154,000 this year in federal funding.
Another station based on the campus of the University of Nebraska at Omaha, KVNO, plays classical music and supports the local arts community through on-air features. That station, which is not affiliated with NPR, would lose roughly 10% of its annual funding. 
“[Corporation for Public Broadcasting] funding not only helps underwrite operations, but it also enables us to offer nationally syndicated classical music programs and provides access to affordable music licensing,” said Sherry Brownrigg, KVNO’s General Manager. “Without this critical support, music rights alone could cost us millions annually.”
If any changes are made to the Senate bill, the package would have to go back to the House for another vote — and quickly if Congress wants to meet the 45-day deadline for the package before it expires.

Music and community will take center stage this Thursday as the Rocking the Docks summer concert series hosts a special benefit event supporting the SL24 Unlocke The Light Foundation.
The July 17 concert, dubbed “Bump, Set, Light,” will mark the official kickoff of the foundation’s summer awareness campaign focused on youth mental health.
Proceeds from the event will benefit SL24, an organization founded in memory of Sean Locke, a former standout student-athlete who died by suicide.
The foundation provides mental health education, resources, and support for teens and young adults across Delaware.
Headlining the waterfront concert at the Lewes Ferry Terminal will be Yacht Lobsters, known for their smooth, harmony-driven renditions of yacht rock favorites.
The band is set to perform two sets beginning around 6 p.m.
In addition to live music, the event will feature a lively local vendor market and a variety of food trucks, including DaNizza Wood Fired Pizza, Grandpa Mac, Pretzelvania, Shore Island Empanadas, and Cup ‘R Cone Ice Cream.
Grain on the Rocks will also offer a special event menu onsite.
“This is the kind of night where music meets meaning,” said Matt VanBelle, founder of Rocking the Docks. “It’s a chance for our concerts to support an amazing organization and for a cause that touches so many lives.”
The SL24 Unlocke The Light Foundation has become a leader in promoting mental wellness across Delaware, opening “Light House” wellness centers in schools and expanding access to mental health support for young people. The foundation’s motto, “It’s OK to not be OK,” aims to break the stigma surrounding mental illness.
The concert is Thursday at the Lewes Ferry Terminal (Rocking the Docks), with VIP gates open at 5 p.m., general admission starting at 5:30 p.m., and music starting around 6 p.m.
Tickets are available here, and admission is free for children under 12.

Kristen McDonald Rivet has emerged in Michigan’s 8th Congressional District, with Amir Hassan announcing a bid for the seat on Sunday.
Hassan is a U.S. Navy veteran and a former federal law enforcement officer, and among the first to announce plans to challenge McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City).
The candidate in a video released Sunday extolled his upbringing in Flint, where he was born and raised, his decision to join the Navy and his service at the Guantanamo Bay base and prison facility in Cuba before working for the federal government.
“Where I’m from, we’re raised to think Democrats are the good guys,” Hassan said in his campaign introduction. “We’ve been held culturally hostage for over half a century. But look around. Flint is what happens when your vote is taken for granted. Where’s your return on investment?”

It also opened the opportunity to begin hitting McDonald Rivet head on as her first real opponent on the GOP side of the race.
“I responded (as a federal law enforcement officer) when the radical left attacked ICE, federal buildings and tried to destroy communities,” Hassan said. “I was spit on, punched and attacked. The Democrats? They stood with the mobs. And Congresswoman Kristen McDonald Rivet goes along with her party every time. She’s not fighting for us. She’s just another politician fighting for herself.”
Centered around the Tri-Cities area of Saginaw, Bay City and Midland, the 8th District includes all of Saginaw and Bay counties, almost all of Genesee County, including the City of Flint, as well as portions of Midland and Tuscola counties. 
While McDonald Rivet won the district by nearly seven points in 2024, and President Donald Trump by just two points, the National Republican Congressional Committee indicated they had their eye on flipping it next year.
Hassan also stands out among Republican candidates in the cycle in that he is Muslim. He noted that his time as a watch commander at Guantanamo Bay strengthened that devotion, as he saw first-hand how the tenets of his religion could be transformed “into something evil,” a reference to the accused terrorists housed at the facility.
His campaign website notes that he has zero tolerance for political extremism and fully supports U.S. aid and defence to Israel. That said, he referred to himself as an “American First patriot,” which has become synonymous with the fringes of the MAGA movement even as that stance becomes more mainstream in the Republican Party.
“I’m not going to Washington to fit in, I’m going to serve,” Hassan said. “I’m going to lead.”

Federal freeze puts $33 million of Idaho education funding on ice

A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma County lawsuit challenging a Catholic charter school has been dropped following the school’s failed appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Court’s 4-4 stalemate upheld an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision against permitting the country’s first religious charter school to begin operating in the state with taxpayer funds.
While Catholic leaders, a small state agency and Attorney General Gentner Drummond debated their case before the nation’s highest court, a separate lawsuit opposing the religious school was pending in Oklahoma County District Court. The coalition of local parents, faith leaders and public education advocates who filed the Oklahoma County case announced Monday they have voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit in light of the higher court decisions.
The plaintiffs and their legal counsel — who include attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation — declared victory while dropping their case.
“We’re pleased that the courts stopped this direct assault on public education and religious freedom,” said Daniel Mach, of the ACLU. “ Public schools must remain secular and welcome all students, regardless of faith.”
The Oklahoma Parent Legislative Advocacy Coalition was the first plaintiff in the lawsuit. Chairperson Misty Bradley said the group is grateful for those who supported their case and for the attorney general’s “successful efforts to uphold Oklahoma’s constitution and protect its taxpayers and public schools.”

Officials from the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa first applied to open St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in 2023. Later that year, the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, a small state agency that oversaw online charter schools, approved the application to open St. Isidore, permitting it to operate with taxpayer funds.
St. Isidore would have offered an online education to students in all parts of the state. Although students of any religion or no faith could have attended the school, St. Isidore would have taught Catholic doctrine and functioned according to church beliefs.
The Oklahoma County lawsuit was the first to be filed against the school, followed by the attorney general’s request that the state Supreme Court intervene. The state Supreme Court decided last year that a religious charter school would be unconstitutional.
Both St. Isidore and the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in May. 
The eight justices who heard the case deadlocked at 4-4, which allowed the state Supreme Court’s decision to stand.
Catholic leaders, who did not immediately comment on the Oklahoma County case Monday, said they are exploring other options to provide an online Catholic education.
Gov. Kevin Stitt, a supporter of St. Isidore, said the matter of publicly funded religious charter schools is “far from a settled issue” and suggested it would reach the U.S. Supreme Court again.

ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday it has approved its fourth naturally derived color ingredient in the past two months. 
The latest color is gardenia blue, or genipin, which comes from the fruit of gardenia flowers. The announcement was billed as another step in the Make America Healthy Again initiative headed by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
“Every day, children are exposed to synthetic chemicals in food that serve no purpose and threaten their health,” Kennedy said in a statement. “The FDA’s approval of gardenia blue shows we’re finally putting kids first.”

Per the announcement, the gardenia dye can be used in sports drinks, flavored or enhanced noncarbonated water, fruit drinks, ready-to-drink teas, hard candy, and soft candy.
FDA previously approved two naturally derived blue dyes, galdieria extract and butterfly pea flower extract, which can also make green and purple hues. It also approved calcium phosphate as a naturally derived white dye to be used in ready-to-eat chicken, candy melts and sugars. 
HHS and FDA announced plans in April to “phase out all petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation’s food supply,” and to fast track the four natural color additives that are now approved, along with other natural dyes. 


Iowa legislation stalled 
Lawmakers in Iowa sought to ban the use of synthetic dyes, and margarine, in schools with a bill during the 2025 legislative session, but the bill did not see floor debate. 


The announcement set a goal for the industry to “eliminate” food, drug and cosmetic synthetic dyes, including Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, and Blue No. 2 by the end of next year. 
FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, said in the announcement about gardenia approval, the “expedited timeline” the administration has taken shows its “serious intent” to move away from petroleum-derived dyes. 
“Now, by expanding the palette of available colors derived from natural sources, food manufacturers have a variety of options available that will make it easier to end their use of petroleum-based dyes,” Makary said in the release.
The administration also urged manufacturers to expedite their phaseout of Red No. 3 dye. FDA revoked authorization of it in January and called for a phaseout by January 2027. 
According to the release, about 40% of the food industry has committed to a voluntary phaseout by 2027 of the petroleum-based food dyes.
The industry group Consumer Brands Association announced Friday its plans to voluntarily phase out synthetically derived dyes from products served at schools by the start of the 2026-2027 school year.

Nov. 3, 2023. (Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled on Friday that a law passed by Maine voters in 2023 prohibiting foreign government spending in elections is likely unconstitutional. The ruling underscores that the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on corporate contributions continues to control the campaign finance landscape, those on both sides of the issue said. 
The decision, which affirmed a district court’s temporary stay on the state from enforcing the law, is not the final word, as it will next return to the lower court. 
The law prevents foreign government-influenced entities, defined as companies with 5% or more foreign government ownership, from donating to state and local ballot measures. It also requires media outlets to establish policies to stop campaign ads from those prohibited entities. 
Voters overwhelmingly approved the law in 2023 with 86% voting in support. 
“We really wanted to deal with the underlying root problem here of the inability of citizens to control their own elections,” said Maine Sen. Rick Bennett, chair of the ballot question committee and independent candidate for governor. “Now with this ruling… it means that foreign-government controlled entities, even with 100% foreign government control, can still spend millions of dollars in Maine elections.”
Meanwhile, Charles Miller, a senior attorney at the Institute for Free Speech who filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs, argued the decision sends a message that states can’t put vague parameters on free speech. 
Utilities, media groups sue state over foreign electioneering ban

“I think that we citizens have to all be on high alert for clever ways that politicians are going to use to try to limit our speech rights, and we have to fight against it, even when the target of those laws at the time are things that we don’t want to hear,” Miller said. 
This law was one of two campaign finance changes Maine voters passed by referendum in recent years. 
In 2024, voters also overwhelmingly approved a law to place limits on donations to political action committees that independently spend money to try to support or defeat candidates — teeing up a path to get the Supreme Court to reevaluate its 2010 decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that enabled corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections.
A decision on the lawsuit filed against the 2024 referendum is expected on Tuesday, before which the state agreed not to enforce that law. The plaintiffs believe Friday’s ruling could have consequences for that case, too. 
The Office of the Maine Attorney General, which is defending the law on behalf of the state, does not comment on pending litigation, Director of Public Affairs Danna Hayes said.

Foreign spending in elections 
Three different lawsuits arguing  the ban on foreign government spending is unconstitutional were consolidated in the appeal. The utility companies Central Maine Power and Versant Power each filed a lawsuit. Two media groups, the Maine Association of Broadcasters and the Maine Press Association, jointly filed another.
The majority opinion issued on Friday, written by Judge Lara Montecalvo, concluded that the law is too broad in its definition of foreign government because it silences U.S. corporations that have their own First Amendment rights. 
Central Maine Power is owned by the Spanish multinational company Iberdrola, while Versant’s parent company is owned by the city of Calgary in Canada. The companies’ filings outlined concern that the law prevents them from speaking on matters of concern to their company. 
As the decision notes, this referendum was passed amid attempts to prevent the construction of an energy transmission line to Canada, which CMP and Versant would benefit from. The companies spent millions to oppose that referendum as well as another in 2023 that would have replaced the utilities with a consumer-owned utility. 
While the court found that Maine has a “compelling interest” to limit foreign government influence in its elections, it ruled that the state has no such interest in trying to limit the “appearance of” foreign influence, such as with CMP and Versant.
The appeals court specifically highlighted a challenge it sees with the law’s practical implementation, given the prevalence of corporate ownership of publicly traded companies these days, which Miller sees as noteworthy. 
“A corporation might not even know when it crosses that 5% threshold because of the way that stocks are traded routinely on a daily basis,” Miller said. “They could enter into and out of that threshold without even knowing it.” 
The appeals court agreed, noting further that, “as a consequence, U.S. corporations with First Amendment protections will likely choose not to speak at all rather than risk criminal penalties,” the court wrote. 
Bennett noted that the percentage that constitutes foreign influence will continue to be litigated, adding, “If we have to consider adjusting the law because of the ultimate court decision, whenever that comes months from now, then I think the Legislature could consider that.”
However, he also noted that there are other parts of the law that aren’t being challenged, one being a requirement that Maine’s congressional delegation put forth an “anti-corruption” resolution in Congress that could undo Citizens United.
‘An end-run around Citizens United’
The opinion, supported by all three of the judges on the First Circuit panel, also concluded that the 5% threshold looks like “an end-run around Citizens United, aimed at silencing a large swath of corporations merely because they are corporations.” 
This is the crux of the issue at hand and broader attempts to place stricter regulations on spending in elections, those on both sides agree. 
“Fundamentally, the problem goes back to this notion that the courts are stuck with this precedent saying that money is speech and corporations are people,” Bennett said. 
Citizens United overturned century-old campaign finance restrictions by allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited funds on elections. 










Fundamentally, the problem goes back to this notion that the courts are stuck with this precedent saying that money is speech and corporations are people.


– Maine Sen. Rick Bennett


“Really the most critical point overarching all of this is the court’s recognition that this case is controlled by Citizens United,” Miller said. 
Miller believes the circuit court’s point on that decision in particular could also have consequences for the lawsuit against the 2024 referendum, in which Miller is representing the plaintiffs.
Three months after Citizens United, in SpeechNow.org v. FEC, the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court upheld that contributions to PACs cannot be regulated, either, so long as the PAC is independent from the campaign it is supporting. That decision essentially created the “super PAC,” which can receive unlimited contributions but can’t contribute directly to candidates. Other lower federal and state courts followed suit and the ruling was never reviewed by the Supreme Court.
Those behind Maine’s 2024 referendum to place limits on donations to PACs, including legal scholar Larry Lessig, argue that the reasoning behind SpeechNow is incorrect. They say large contributions to PACs inevitably create a risk of quid pro quo corruption, given that donors and candidates have the opportunity to collaborate even if a PAC is independent.
Supporters therefore expected, and planned, for the referendum’s legality to be challenged, presenting an eventual path to the Supreme Court.
Lessig previously told Maine Morning Star he specifically chose to introduce the referendum in the jurisdiction of the First Circuit Court because it hasn’t ruled on whether Super PACs are constitutionally required — meaning there is no precedent.
“They came to Maine to do this because they thought the First Circuit was their best chance to get a court to sort of try to sidestep or ignore Citizens United, and this opinion indicates that they have no appetite to do so,” Miller said. 
Editor’s Note: The Maine Press Association, which filed one of the lawsuits, represents about 50 newspapers and digital news outlets in the state, including Maine Morning Star.

The Iowa Board of Nursing recently charged Loreen Benton, 64, of Guthrie Center, with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient, and failing to assess or evaluate a patient as required.
According to the board, between March 2023 and February 2024, while Benton was employed at Guthrie County Hospital, she “displayed a pattern of repeated medication errors, documentation omissions, unprofessional workplace conduct, and poor performance.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board also alleges she was responsible for “numerous incidents related to incompetent or unsafe nursing practices that could have resulted in patient harm” and which were documented by the hospital.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Benton agreed to refrain from contesting the charges and also agreed to voluntarily surrender her license.
According to her agreement with the board, Benton will be eligible to apply for reinstatement in one year upon a showing that the basis for the “revocation” of her license no longer exists and that it’s in the public interest for the license to be reinstated.
Other nursing board actions
Other Iowa nurses recently charged or sanctioned by the board include:
— Registered nurse Chris Armstrong-Barger, 50, was recently charged by the board with misappropriating medications of a patient or an agency. The board alleges that Armstrong-Barger worked at an unspecified hospital from 2016 through 2024. In May 2024, the board alleges, she was fired after being observed on surveillance video appearing to steal a 50 milligram tablet of Trazadone, which was later shown to be missing from the hospital inventory. The board also alleged that video from April 2024 appears to show Armstrong-Barger misappropriating injectable diphenhydramine from epidural kits at the same hospital. The board agreed to settle the case by issuing Armstrong-Barger a warning, placing her license on probation for two years, and requiring her to submit to a substance-abuse evaluation.
— Licensed practical nurse Payton Hanni, 24, who was recently charged by the board with violating patient privacy laws. The board alleged that shortly after she became licensed in 2023, Hanni was employed at an unspecified hospital where she repeatedly accessed records for patients who also happened to be employees of the hospital and then discussed her colleagues’ confidential medical information with other co-workers. According to the board, Hanni was fired by the hospital. The board agreed to settle the disciplinary case by issuing Hanni a citation and warning and requiring her to complete 30 hours of continuing-education training on patient-privacy laws.
— Registered nurse Kelsey Ludwig, 33, of Norwalk, who was recently charged by the board with violating patient privacy laws. The board alleged that in January 2024, Ludwig accessed the medical records of two patients for whom she was not providing care. She was subsequently fired, according to the board. The board, which has not disclosed where Ludwig worked at the time of the alleged incident, agreed to settle the disciplinary case by requiring Ludwig to complete 30 hours of continuing-education training on documentation. The settlement agreement calls for no warning, citation or other sanctions to be imposed.
— Registered nurse Emily Mellott, who was recently charged by the board with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient and with failing to assess or evaluate a patient. The board alleges that in September 2023, it received a complaint alleging Mellott failed to follow proper documentation and coordination of care standards. An internal investigation by Mellott’s employer, a home-health provider that is unnamed by the board, allegedly revealed “numerous occurrences of late documentation and incomplete documentation,” according to the board, which also alleged her actions “disrupted patient continuity of care and created safety risks for patients.”  The board agreed to settle the disciplinary case by issuing Mellott a citation and warning and requiring her to complete 30 hours of continuing-education training on documentation.
— Advanced registered nurse practitioner Daniel Bench of Ankeny. Although the board’s allegations aren’t clearly stated in the charging documents, they indicate that at some unspecified time in the past, while working in an assisted-living facility, Bench failed to complete a full review of a patient’s prescriptive history prior to doing something that involved a controlled substance called Vyvanse.
The records also indicate Bench failed to consider a patient’s substance abuse history before increasing the patient’s dosage of clonazepam by 50%; failed to properly assess a patient for potential suicide; failed to adequately evaluate a patient before prescribing Adderall concurrent with other drugs prescribed by a physician; and failed to adequately evaluate a patient who was subsequently diagnosed as bipolar.
To resolve the case, the board agreed to issue Bench a citation and warning and ordered him to complete additional training on ethics, documentation and prescribing controlled substances. State records indicate that in 2023, Bench was working at UnityPoint Health and CommonSpirit Health.

Byron Donalds outside the Florida House of Representatives Chambers on Thursday, April 3, 2025. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix) Will Byron Donalds be challenged for the Republican nomination for governor in 2026?
No serious contender has emerged as of yet, and a new poll published on Monday shows that of the various Republicans being floated as potential opponents to the U.S. representative from Southwest Florida, only First Lady Casey DeSantis presents a serious challenge — at least until voters are informed that President Trump has already endorsed Donalds.
The St. Pete Polls survey shows that in a four-way Republican contest between Donalds, Ms. DeSantis, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, and former House Speaker Paul Renner, Donalds leads Casey DeSantis by eight points, 35%-27%. Simpson gets 3% and Renner 2%.
When Hillsborough County state Sen. Jay Collins is substituted for Ms. DeSantis, Donalds gets 43%, Simpson 4%, Renner 3%, and Collins just 2%.
However, when poll respondents were informed that Trump had endorsed Donalds and Gov. Ron DeSantis has (potentially) endorsed Casey DeSantis, Donalds’ lead over Ms. DeSantis balloons to a 49%-21% lead, with nearly 30% undecided.
In a one-on-one matchup in which voters were informed that Donalds has been endorsed by Trump and Jay Collins was (potentially) endorsed by Ron DeSantis, Donalds leads 57%-10%, with the remaining 33% undecided.
“Byron Donalds will be Florida’s next Governor because he is the only proven conservative fighter endorsed by President Trump,” said Ryan Smith, chief strategist for the Donalds campaign in a written statement.
“Byron is working hard to pass President Trump’s agenda in Congress. Byron is barnstorming the state meeting with conservative voters. And Byron is raising the resources necessary to win this campaign. As Governor, Byron Donalds will fight side by side with President Trump to Make America Great Again.”
Gov. DeSantis is believed likely to endorse a challenger to Donalds for the nomination, but who remains unclear with the GOP gubernatorial primary still more than a year away.
The survey of 831 likely Republican election voters was conducted from July 8-10. It has a margin for error of 3.4%.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s highest court has OK’d the language of a voter identification referendum question that highlights other substantial changes the reform would make to state voting laws. 
Alex Titcomb, campaign manager for the ballot question committee “Voter ID for ME,” and four other registered voters challenged the wording for a citizen initiative to change various election laws, including the implementation of a photo ID requirement for voting. They argued that the language did not meet the statutory requirements of being understandable and not misleading to a reasonable voter, but the courts disagreed. 
The Dinner Table PAC launched the campaign in April 2024 as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at the polls. However, the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January seeks to change additional aspects of Maine election law, such as absentee voting. 
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows called the petition “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” when it was first submitted to the state. When Bellows released the wording for the question that will appear on the November ballot, it encompassed the changes beyond photo ID requirements. 
It will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?”
Under law, voters have the right to appeal the final decision on the wording, so Titcomb filed a legal petition in Cumberland County Superior Court, arguing the ballot language fails to meet the standards of clarity, accuracy and impartiality.
The Superior Court affirmed the question’s wording, finding that it is understandable and not misleading. 
Titcomb appealed the decision, arguing that the language used confusing terms and singled out the effect on seniors and people with disabilities. 
The Maine Supreme Judicial Court then reviewed the case and upheld the Superior Court’s judgement. In its decision, issued Friday, the court noted that the language accurately reflected the proposed legislation and used terms that would be clear to an informed voter. While the court also acknowledged that the question was longer than usual, it said that is necessary to convey the various changes proposed.

This story was originally reported by The 19th. 
A new child tax credit is coming next year, bringing significant changes that will alter how much assistance families receive — and which families can receive it.
With his tax and spending package, President Donald Trump passed a permanent change to the child tax credit spearheaded by congressional Republicans. It goes into effect for families filing income tax returns in 2026.
The changes increase the total amount of the tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200, and index it to inflation so it grows over the years, a change advocates have championed for years. However, the package also introduces new parameters to qualify for the credit that will directly affect immigrants and the lowest-income families.
For the first time, children and at least one of their parents or guardians will have to have a Social Security number to be able to qualify for the child tax credit. That means an estimated 2.7 million American children who likely qualify for the credit this year will no longer be able to get it as of next year.
The tax credit was passed in 1997. Families have used it to help cover basic needs like food and also wants, like getting their children into extracurricular activities.
But for its nearly 30-year history, the credit has been structured in a way that families with the lowest incomes couldn’t get the full amount. With the most recent change, and because the credit phases in depending on income and the number of children you have, families have to earn more before they can claim the full amount.
Democrats had been pushing to change those requirements in recent years so that the lowest-income families could get more of the credit, but Republicans pushed back, saying it disincentivized people to work.
Under the new child tax credit, an estimated 19 million children are now blocked from receiving the full amount, compared with 17 million currently, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, which has done much of the research and analysis on the child tax credit. The share of children from marginalized backgrounds who are not going to be able to receive the full amount has also gone up for each group:

48% of American Indian or Alaska Native children (from 45% under the current law)
45% of Black children (from 41%)
39% of Latinx children (from 34%)
60% of children of single mothers (from 55%)
35% of children in rural parts of the country (from 30%)

“Families of all sizes are going to need higher levels of income to be eligible for the full credit amount,” said Christopher Yera, a research analyst at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. The child tax credit is being cut at a time when other vital services for low-income Americans are seeing reduction.
Under the same tax package, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is losing $186 billion in funding through 2034, affecting eligibility for free school meals and for families that rely on the assistance to put food on the table. Another $1 trillion will be cut from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the next decade.
“All these families that are going to lose access to basic needs, it would be handy if the folks harmed by that were actually reached by the child tax credit,” said Meredith Dodson, the senior director of public policy for the Coalition on Human Needs who has been lobbying for an expansion of the credit.
Here is a breakdown of how the new child tax credit works and how to access it:
What is the child tax credit?
The child tax credit is a return parents and guardians receive in their taxes annually for every child under the age of 17 in their care. Stepchildren, foster children, half siblings and descendants, including grandchildren and nieces or nephews, may also qualify if the tax filer is their main caretaker.
Since 2017, the most families could claim from the credit is $2,000 per child, and that amount goes down after a certain threshold.
Guardians who earn very little or nothing have never been able to claim the full amount of the credit except for in 2021, when it temporarily expanded during the pandemic.
What is the new child tax credit amount?
For the 2025 tax filing year, the child tax credit will increase to $2,200. Eligible parents will see this amount in their tax returns next year.
The credit will also be adjusted annually to account for inflation beginning in 2026.
Who qualifies for the new child tax credit?
If filing a single return, parents and guardians must have a Social Security number to access the credit. This is a significant departure from prior years when only the children, but not the adults claiming them, had to have a Social Security number.
For parents and guardians who are filing jointly, only one parent has to have a Social Security number to qualify. That means some mixed-status households will be able to qualify for the credit.
To be able to claim a child, the child has to have:

Lived with the parent or caregiver for at least six months during 2025 (though there are some exceptions)
Lived six months or more in the United States
Have a Social Security number

The shift is part of a years-long effort to limit immigrants’ access to government services. Before 2017, any child living in the United States was eligible for the child tax credit. Then Trump’s tax cuts package in 2017 changed that rule to require that the child have a Social Security number to qualify. Their parents could use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, to file their taxes and still be eligible for the credit. Now at least one of those parents will need to also have a Social Security number.
Families headed by an undocumented single parent, where the child is an American citizen, will not get the child tax credit at all.
“Instead of actually expanding the [child tax credit], they took it away from millions of kids,” Dodson said. “There are important changes [in the law] but they kind of miss the mark when the whole thing is leaving out the folks who need it the most.”
Does everyone who qualifies get $2,200?
No. Families who earn less than $2,500 a year do not receive anything. After that, the credit begins to phase in depending on how much families earn. (Keep reading for exact figures)
Some families earn little and owe no taxes. Those families are eligible for only a portion of the child tax credit, up to $1,700 in 2025. That means that even if your tax liability is zero, you can still receive a check for up to $1,700 for the child tax credit.
Then, the credit starts to phase out once families earn too much to qualify for the full amount. For a single filer, the credit starts to decrease for any amount they earn past $200,000; for joint filers the threshold is $400,000. Caregivers earning more than $240,000 for a single filer and $440,000 for joint filers do not receive anything.
What is the minimum you need to earn to qualify for the full amount?
 
According to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University:

Families with one child: A single filer needs to earn at least $28,700; joint filers need to earn at least $36,500.
Families with two children: A single filer needs to earn at least $33,700; joint filers need to earn at least $41,500.
Families with three children: A single filer needs to earn at least $38,700; joint filers need to earn at least $46,500.
Families with four children: A single filer needs to earn at least $45,800; joint filers need to earn at least $51,500.

Who doesn’t qualify?
Children who don’t have a Social Security number don’t qualify. Single parents or guardians who don’t have a Social Security number also don’t qualify, even if the child does have a Social Security number.
An estimated 28% of children will not qualify for the full amount because their parents earn too little. That is up from 25% previously, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Policy at Columbia. The share of kids who are ineligible because their parents earn too much stays the same, at 4%.
The states with the largest share of children who don’t qualify for the full amount are Mississippi (40.6%), Louisiana (38.2%), New Mexico (38.2%), Alabama (35.1%) and Kentucky (34.9%).
How do you claim the credit in your taxes?
Filers must include their children or dependents on Form 1040, the Individual Income Tax Return, and also complete a Schedule 8812.
Is this like the child tax credit in 2021?
No. In 2021, that credit was expanded to give families up to $3,600, much of it in the form of monthly checks, instead of an annual lump sum. The 2021 expansion allowed the poorest families in the country, those who don’t file income taxes, to access the child tax credit for the first time in its history. Those pandemic-era changes cut the child poverty rate in 2021 to a historic low of 5.2%.
But the temporary changes lasted only a year, and an effort by Democrats to make them permanent failed. The tax credit then reverted back to its usual amount — $2,000 — and the child poverty rate rose to 12.4% in 2022.
Is this a temporary change or a permanent one?
This is a permanent change. Previous child tax credit expansions have been in place for a set number of years and when it was time for those changes to expire, lawmakers renegotiated the new parameters.
That is why the child tax credit came up this year — changes put in place in 2017 were set to expire in 2025.
What the new version does differently is make the changes permanent. Lawmakers can still tweak the credit if they want to later, but there is no set date where the changes will end and the credit will revert back to a former amount.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/child-care2-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 12:22:00.476384

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi over the weekend stepped in to end the federal case against a Utah plastic surgeon accused of issuing falsified COVID-19 vaccination cards to patients who hadn’t actually received the vaccine, then destroying the government-issued vaccine doses.
Dr. Michael Kirk Moore and some members of his staff were accused of distributing at least 1,937 fraudulent vaccination cards without administering a vaccine, with prosecutors saying patients paid cash or made required donations in exchange. In the cases of some minors, at their parents’ request, Moore administered saline shots so that the children would think they had been vaccinated, prosecutors said.
Moore and his staff destroyed more than $28,000 worth of government-provided COVID-19 vaccines, according to federal charges.
As doctor accused of falsifying vaccine records goes to trial, Utah House speaker voices support

In a post on the social media platform X on Saturday, Bondi announced she was dismissing the case, saying “Dr. Moore gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so. He did not deserve the years in prison he was facing. It ends today.”
Moore and his codefendants were one week into what was scheduled to be a 15-day jury trial, facing charges including conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to convert, sell, convey, and dispose of government property. 
In a statement issued after the announcement, attorneys representing Moore emphasized he has maintained his innocence and that he would have succeeded at trial. The dismissal closes a “painful chapter,” they wrote.
“The Attorney General’s decision to dismiss all charges before the trial concluded reflects what the evidence has shown all along: that our clients did not commit a crime. They honored the personal medical choices of their patients. They never received a dollar in return. And no unexpired vaccines were ever destroyed,” the statement said. 
Moore’s case has drawn support from those critical of government regulations during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, including Utah state lawmakers like House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper.At a rally on the courthouse steps last week as the trial got underway, where supporters held signs proclaiming “Dr. Moore is a hero, not a criminal,” Schultz called the charges a case of government overreach, praising Moore while criticizing former Republican Gov.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Measles cases have surpassed a recent 2019 record to reach the highest level since 1992, with at least 1,289 cases reported in 39 states.
The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump administration under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this month challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell announced on Monday that she will run for the state Senate District 16 seat in the Tampa Bay area next year. The seat is being vacated by Democrat Darryl Rouson because of term limits.
Driskell, a Hillsborough County Democrat, was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2018 and is term-limited from running again for that seat next year. There had been speculation at one point that she was considering a run for governor, but that talk had quieted over the past year.
“I am incredibly excited to announce my campaign to serve the people of Florida State Senate District 16,” Driskell said in a written statement.
“As a member of the Florida House for the past seven years, I’ve fought to lower housing costs, provide property insurance relief, and expand access to affordable healthcare. Our state faces significant challenges, and I am ready to bring my dedication and experience to the State Senate to ensure all Floridians have the opportunity to thrive. This campaign is about protecting your freedom to be healthy, prosperous, and safe, and I will fight for you every step of the way.”
Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner announced her candidacy for the seat last December. She was first elected to the Florida House in 2020 and intended to run for a congressional seat in Pinellas County in 2022 before it was redistricted to make it less friendly to a Democrat. She did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Senate District 16 includes parts of South St. Petersburg and then goes across Tampa Bay to encompass a large portion of Hillsborough County. That’s significant in the respect that Driskell lives in Hillsborough, whereas Rayner makes Pinellas County her home. Nearly 70% of Democratic primary voters live on the Hillsborough County side of the district, which was drawn up during the 2022 reapportionment process.
Endorsements
Driskell’s announcement carries two significant endorsements, from former Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn and former Tampa Democratic legislator Arthenia Joyner, who previously held the seat before leaving the Legislature in 2016. 
“I’ve known Fentrice for nearly a decade,” Joyner said in a written statement. “She has the experience, vision, and work ethic necessary to be an outstanding State Senator. She has consistently fought for our communities, and I know she will continue that fight as the next senator for District 16. She has my complete and total support.”
Driskell, an attorney, is the first Black woman to lead the Florida House Democrats in the state Legislature and the first person in more than 30 years to win election to that position twice.
Amaro Lionhart is the only Republican to have filed in the race as of yet. The primary election will take place in August 2026.
The configuration of the Senate seat is the subject of a federal lawsuit that went on trial in a Tampa courtroom last month. A lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights & Racial Justice Clinic at New York University representing a group of Tampa and St. Petersburg residents alleges that the Florida Senate’s plan in 2022 to connect Black populations from parts of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties into District 16 was a racial gerrymander. A three-judge panel of federal judges is expected to decide on the case sometime later this summer.

Visitors to Delaware Seashore State Park are being warned to steer clear of designated zones around the Indian River Inlet starting Monday as state officials begin testing an upgraded sand bypass system.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) announced that the mechanical system — designed to mimic the natural flow of sand along the coast — will be tested in multiple phases through early August.
The testing schedule runs Monday through Thursday, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., on the following dates: July 14–17, July 21–24, July 28–31, and August 4–6.
During these times, high-pressure pumps will move large volumes of sand from the inlet’s south side, where it tends to accumulate, to the eroding north side.
Officials warn that this creates unstable and hazardous conditions both in the water and on the beach.

The saturated sand can pose a risk of entrapment, and the adjacent waters may produce dangerous rip currents.
Barriers, signage, and white buoys with orange bands will mark the restricted areas, which remain off-limits even when testing isn’t actively underway.
DNREC staff will be stationed at public access points on both sides of the inlet to guide beachgoers and enforce safety rules.
Violators could face fines ranging from $50 to $250.
The sand bypass system, which had been offline for several years, has recently undergone major upgrades including new pumps and an electric motor.
DNREC officials say the summer testing is critical to ensuring the system is fully functional before it is put into regular operation.
While most of the park’s beaches will remain open, officials urge all visitors to respect posted warnings and avoid the marked zones.
Updates on the project will be shared via DNREC and Delaware Seashore State Park social media channels.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-11.38.08-AM.png,,,2025-07-14 12:22:00.476384
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-14 15:30:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Coast judge upholds secrecy in politically charged case. Media appeals ruling.,"Anita Lee, Sun Herald and Taylor Vance",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/14/mississippi-judge-secrecy-sealed-case-coast-uninsured-motorist-tickets-securix/,A Jackson County judge sealed a politically sensitive court case without a hearing. All Mississippi court files are presumed open unless their are closed with notice and a hearing under guidelines established in 1990.,"A Jackson County Chancery Court judge is denying the public access to a case that involves several politically connected Mississippians and their failed venture to ticket uninsured motorists using cameras and artificial intelligence.
Media companies Mississippi Today and the Sun Herald have filed for relief with the state Supreme Court, arguing that Chancery Judge Neil Harris improperly closed the court file without notice and a hearing to consider alternatives. The media outlets say the court file should be opened.
Mississippi Today in June filed its motion asking that Harris unseal the case, which he denied six days later. 
Gulfport attorney Henry Laird writes in the media companies’ petition for state Supreme Court review, “The Chancery Court sealing the entire court file both before and after Mississippi Today’s motion to unseal the file violates the public and press’ cherished right of openness and access to its public court system and records.” 
Mississippi judges have long followed a 1990 state Supreme Court decision that says, “A hearing must be held in which the press is allowed to intervene on behalf of the public and present argument, if any, against closure.” 
Instead, Harris said he found no hearing necessary after reviewing the pleadings to open the file. The case, he said, is between two private companies.
“There are no public entities included as parties,” he wrote, “and there are no public funds at issue. Other than curiosity regarding issues between private parties, there is no public interest involved.”
The case involves what is usually a public function: Issuing tickets to the owners of uninsured vehicles.  And, according to one party to the case, the Mississippi Department of Public Safety is owed $345,000 from the uninsured motorist program.
READ MORE: Private business ticketed uninsured Mississippi vehicle owners. Then the program blew up.
Since the entire court file is closed, the public is unable to see why the judge sealed the case. The Mississippians said in the Chancery Court case that they have  “substantial” business interests to protect and “a lot of political importance,” an attorney opposing them said in a related federal case that is not sealed.

Jackson County Chancery Judge Neil Harris
Georgia-based Securix LLC signed up its first Mississippi client in 2021, the city of Ocean Springs, an agreement with the city showed. Securix developed a program that uses traffic cameras, artificial intelligence and bulk data on insured motorists to identify the owners of vehicles without insurance.
To sign on other Mississippi cities, Securix enlisted three well-known consultants, Quinton Dickerson, Josh Gregory and Robert Wilkinson. Dickerson and Gregory are Republican political operatives in Jackson who have run numerous state and local campaigns and advise many of the state’s top elected officials. Wilkinson, a Coast attorney, has represented local governments and government agencies, including the city of Ocean Springs.
MS business partnership sours
In 2023, the Mississippians formed QJR LLC. Their company entered a 50-50 partnership with Securix called Securix Mississippi.
Securix Mississippi sold the cities of Biloxi, Pearl and Senatobia on the uninsured driver program. 
Fees collected from uninsured drivers were apportioned to the company, the cities and the Department of Public Safety, the operating agreement with Biloxi showed.
The citations offered three options, according to copies included in a federal lawsuit filed by three Mississippi residents who received them:

Call a toll-free number and provide proof of insurance.
Enter a diversion program that charges a $300 fee and includes a short online course and requires agreement that the vehicle will not be driven uninsured on public roadways.
Contest the ticket in court and risk $510 in fines and fees, plus the potential of a one-year driver’s license suspension.

The Securix Mississippi partnership soon soured.
Securix Chairman Jonathan Miller of Georgia said in a sworn court declaration submitted in the federal case that he was subjected around March 2024 to a “freeze out” by members and/or employees of QJR. They stopped giving him information, Miller said.
The Department of Public Safety in August pulled the plug on the controversial ticketing program, shutting off the company’s access to the insured driver database.
In September, QJR filed its Chancery Court lawsuit against Securix LLC. 
What is known about the case comes from documents in the federal court file. QJR claims the company and its members have been defamed by Miller and Securix and wants their 50-50 business partnership dissolved.
The Chancery Court case does not even show up when the parties are searched for by name. 
With a case number gleaned from the federal court file, a search of chancery records shows only that the case is under seal.
Normally, when a case is under seal, the docket would still be available. A docket lists all records and proceedings in a case. While sealed records are listed and described, they can’t be viewed. 
“There is no court file,” attorney Laird said in asking the Supreme Court to review Judge Harris’ decision to leave the file sealed. “There is no docket sheet. There is absolutely no access on the part of the public or press to their public court file in this case.”
Judge closes file without public notice
All Mississippi court files are presumed open unless they are closed with notice and a hearing under guidelines established in the 1990 case Gannett River States Publishing Co. vs. Hand.
“It appears that the judge ignored what has been settled law in Mississippi since 1990,” said retired Jackson attorney Leonard Van Slyke, who represented Gannett in the case and still advises the media.
He added, “Since that time, there have not been many efforts to close a courtroom or a court file because the rules are pretty clear as to when that can be done. It is obvious from the rules that this would be a rare occurrence.”
 A court file can be closed only if a party in the case requesting closure can show an “overriding interest” that would be prejudiced by publicity.
The Supreme Court said in 1990 that the public is entitled to at least 24 hours’ notice — on the court docket — before a judge considers closure. As a representative of the public, the media has a right to a hearing before a court file or proceeding is closed.
At the hearing, the judge must consider the least restrictive closure possible and reasonable alternatives. The judge also must make findings that explain why alternatives to closure were rejected.
The court wrote in Gannett vs. Hand:
“A transcript of the closure hearing should be made public and if a petition for extraordinary relief concerning a closure order is filed in this Court, it should be accompanied by the transcript, the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the evidence adduced at the hearing upon which the judge bases the findings and conclusions.”
Because Judge Harris held no hearing, the high court will have a scant record on which to base its review. Without a court record, Laird pointed out in his filing, the public can have no confidence the judge made a sound decision.
Kevin Goldberg, an attorney who serves as vice president and First Amendment expert at the nonpartisan, nonprofit Freedom Forum, said the First Amendment guarantees the public access to courts.
In the Securix case, he said, a private business was doing work normally performed by a police department or other public agency, and residents could be snared into legal proceedings when they received tickets and public funds were involved.
“These are not private people in a small town, going about their business,” Goldberg said. “These people’s business is the public’s business . . . I think that means they need to accept that they’re going to be scrutinized all the time, including when they voluntarily make a decision to go to court.”

(File/Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A civil lawsuit accuses a state senator who’s running for governor of funneling more than $2 million from his aircraft chartering company into personal and campaign expenses.
Sen. Josh Kimbrell’s campaign dismissed the lawsuit as a political move.
The lawsuit was filed in Greenville County just over two weeks after the Boiling Springs Republican announced his candidacy for governor, joining a growing field of candidates ahead of the June 2026 primary election. Filing for the election is still months away.
“We’re witnessing a regrettable, uncorroborated case of lawfare from a disgruntled, absent business partner with no function or daily involvement in our operations,” Kimbrell said in a statement provided by his campaign. “I’m confident that the facts will come to light, leading to full vindication.”
Kimbrell has not yet filed a formal response to the accusations.
And he did not immediately respond directly to text and voicemail messages left by the SC Daily Gazette.
Two GOP candidates officially enter SC governor’s race

Kimbrell “used a series of complex financial transactions” to move money from his private charter aircraft company, Exodus Aircraft, to his own bank accounts, business partner Frank Rogers of Greenville claimed in the lawsuit filed last Thursday.
That included putting money from the company into Kimbrell’s own PayPal account, transferring money to his wife, who had no stake in the company, and using credit cards in Rogers’ name, the lawsuit claimed.
Kimbrell also established a second company called Exodus Airways, which he used to divert payments to himself, “capitalizing upon the confusion caused by the strikingly similar name,” the lawsuit alleges.
Kimbrell would tell clients to write checks to “Exodus Air,” allowing him to cash the checks in the Exodus Airways bank account instead of the legitimate Exodus Aircraft account, with the help of a trusted banker, Rogers claimed in a sworn statement.
Exodus Aircraft, which specializes in chartered flights for private businesses, was formed in 2017 in Delaware but operates out of Spartanburg, according to business filings. Rogers bought stake in half the company in October 2022, he said in the statement.
Kimbrell, 40, was first elected to the state Senate in 2020, when he ousted longtime Democratic Sen. Glenn Reese. In November, Kimbrell easily defeated a Democrat challenger for the district that’s entirely in Spartanburg County.
The lawsuit claims Kimbrell began funneling money from the charter business in early 2023 for campaign expenses as well as “recreational and personal uses,” the lawsuit claimed.
Kimbrell secretly pursued business loans using falsified information and, in one case, forged Rogers’ signature, the lawsuit claimed.
When Rogers, who shared ownership of the company with Kimbrell, questioned the company’s financial difficulties, Kimbrell tried to blame Rogers and refused to show him the company’s financial records, the lawsuit claimed.
Rogers determined about $2 million was so far unaccounted for, but that amount could rise, he claimed in the lawsuit.
Kimbrell has since resigned his role as manager of the company, but he still has control of its finances, Rogers claimed. If any more money is diverted from the company, it could be forced to close, according to the lawsuit.
Rogers is asking a judge to intervene and institute a temporary restraining order barring Kimbrell from moving money the company earns from chartering its single 30-passenger jet. If his case is successful, Rogers is also seeking a to-be-determined amount of money accounting for the funds he claims were diverted and any other losses, according to the lawsuit.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/kimbrell-laughing-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 12:22:00.476384

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A federal district court judge in New Hampshire issued an injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, and held that a group of noncitizens suing the government have class action standing to sue.
Judge Joseph Laplante’s decision will stop the executive order from taking effect July 27 in New Hampshire and other states that don’t currently have injunctions, but the decision has been stayed until July 17 to allow the government to appeal, he announced in court Thursday.
Issued in January, the executive order, titled “Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship,” seeks to redefine the 14th Amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. The executive order would reverse more than a century of precedent establishing automatic citizenship, and plaintiffs say it would unfairly deprive them of government benefits, such as SNAP and Medicaid.
On Thursday, Laplante agreed.
“The deprivation of U.S. citizenship and the abrupt change of policy that was longstanding, perpetuated by executive order and not statute … that’s irreparable harm,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world, and that’s what makes it irreparable harm.”
Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrant Rights Project, which helped bring the lawsuit, hailed the ruling in a press conference after the hearing.
“This is going to protect every single child around the country from this lawless, unconstitutional, cruel executive order,” he said. “We appreciate the court’s rapid consideration of this issue.”
Laplante’s order comes weeks after the Supreme Court limited the ability of federal courts to block such policies. In that landmark decision, Trump v. Casa, Inc., the high court ruled that nationwide injunctions exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress, and that relief should be targeted only to plaintiffs. But the ruling made an exception for class action lawsuits: national injunctions are possible in those cases if the classes are national, it held.
Thursday’s decision in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire is the first time a court has approved a class action lawsuit designation in order to block the president’s anti-birthright citizenship order. The ACLU had scrambled to file the class action lawsuit within days of the Casa decision in June.
A new interpretation of citizenship
In issuing its executive order, the Trump administration has argued that the longstanding interpretation of who received citizenship under the 14th Amendment is wrong.
That amendment, passed after the Civil War, was designed in part to overturn the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision and grant citizenship to formerly enslaved individuals. But it also established the tradition that those who are born within the U.S. automatically attain citizenship — with exceptions for children of enemy combatants and diplomats — an understanding that was upheld in the 1898 case of U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark.
Birthright citizenship battle ignites questions about Wabanaki rights

Trump, in his executive order, contended instead that the 14th Amendment does not apply to children of noncitizens because it refers specifically to people “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. Lawyers for the Department of Justice have argued that a person must have legal domicile in the U.S. to qualify for birthright citizenship.
But plaintiffs say that interpretation is ahistorical and unconstitutional, and say birthright citizenship is “bedrock law.” They have noted that should the executive order be allowed to stand, families could be unable to access needed social safety net programs, and some siblings could be split between citizens and noncitizens, depending on whether they were born before or after the order.
And lawyers for the plaintiffs have said the order could render children of noncitizens stateless if the country of their parents’ origin does not recognize their nationality.
Objections to the class action
In federal court on Thursday, attorneys on both sides largely sidestepped the larger debate on the meaning of birthright citizenship and focused on the class certification question.
The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, include “Barbara,” an asylum applicant from Honduras who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a child; “Susan,” a student visa holder from Taiwan living in Utah, who gave birth to “Sarah” in April; and “Mark,” a Brazilian citizen living in Florida who gave birth to “Matthew” in March. The names are pseudonymous to protect their identities.
Two of the plaintiffs, Barbara and Susan, have older children, but because the executive order denies citizenship only to babies of noncitizens born after Feb.19, those children’s citizenship status is not in question.
The plaintiffs had attempted to include both the infants and their parents in the class action lawsuits, but Laplante said he would narrow the class certification to include just the infants.
The defendants, who include the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, argued that there was a lack of “commonality” between the plaintiffs due to the plaintiffs’ differing immigration status. The lawyers said a class certification should not be established without the court conducting discovery to determine the domicile status of each plaintiff. They also argued the pseudonyms meant it is impossible to determine whether the plaintiffs are representative of the class.
Eric Hamilton, an attorney for the government, argued in court that the class certification should not be granted because the plaintiffs were too different from each other, and that the court should not grant a national class certification because it would deny the ability for other district courts to arrive at their own rulings.
Instead, Hamilton contended, any injunction by Laplante should apply only to the jurisdiction of the New Hampshire U.S. District Court, and not the whole country. Laplante rejected that reasoning.
“Plaintiffs are now trying to accomplish through a different means what the United States Supreme Court held was beyond the equitable jurisdiction of different district courts,” Hamilton said.
But Wofsy countered that the plaintiffs are a “classic example” of the group of people who meet the standards for a class action lawsuit.
The government is expected to appeal Laplante’s ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and lawyers will push for an expedited process there.
Thursday’s court order does not affect another New Hampshire lawsuit against Trump’s birthright citizenship: New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al. v. Trump. In that case, the Indonesian support organization and individual members sued to block the executive order. In February, Laplante issued an injunction against the executive order that was narrowly tailored to apply to the plaintiffs — and not the whole country — and is likely not affected by the Casa decision. That lawsuit is proceeding before the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.
Laplante’s decision to issue a national injunction Thursday stands in contrast to his decision in the February case to narrow his ruling. At that time, he had called it inappropriate for a district court judge to issue a national injunction.
On Thursday, he clarified that position.
“It’s a better process to narrow these types of decisions and not have judges create national policy,” Laplante said at one point during oral arguments.
But at a different point, he added: “I wasn’t a judge that was comfortable with a national injunction. But class action is different.”

If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.

But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Panasonic is delaying full production in its De Soto battery plant because of dropping electric car sales and U.S. policies that do not support electric cars, international media reports.
The $4 billion economic development project, billed as the largest in Kansas history, is threatened because of decreased electric car sales at Tesla and skepticism from President Donald Trump about encouraging electric vehicle adoption, according to the Nikkei Asia news outlet.
The plant was expected to reach full production by March 2027, and a new target date has not been set, Nikkei reported.
The president’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminates tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles as of Sept. 30, along with eliminating or decreasing multiple green energy tax credits.
The De Soto plant, which was projected to create 4,000 jobs, has a grand opening scheduled Monday.
The Panasonic plant began construction in 2023 after receiving Kansas tax credits, through a program known as APEX that the state created to draw in large economic development projects. Incentives include rebates on capital investments, payroll and staff training.
The APEX program also lowers the corporate income tax rate by 0.5% for Kansas businesses for the fiscal year after a megadeal is signed. Under the APEX deal, Panasonic was expected to receive $829.2 million over 10 years.
The company had plans to provide at least 4,000 jobs, increasing the state’s annual labor income by more than $505 million. The state anticipated the project will create an additional 4,000 jobs through suppliers and community businesses. The state expected to see a $26 return for every $1 invested in tax incentives.
The De Soto community also offered incentives that were based on the company agreeing to employ 2,500 employees, well below the estimated full employment of 4,000.
The city offered to complete $229 million of public infrastructure projects, such as road improvements, and water and sewer projects, using Tax Increment Financing funds, a common economic development tool that uses increased property taxes received from developments to fund projects.
Oklahoma had been in competition with Kansas to land this plant. Oklahoma officials offered the company nearly $700 million in incentives to build in the state.
De Soto Mayor Rick Walker said he has not been notified of any changes in Panasonic’s plans to change their production schedule or their hiring at the plant, but he also was not surprised. The federal approach to a company trying to bring manufacturing to the U.S. has been disappointing, he said.
“We have a company reshoring jobs and then every activity (the federal government) takes has worked against that,” Walker said.
The slowdown of electric vehicle sales has been anticipated, he said, but he added that projections for sales overall still show strong market opportunities.
“What was being reported earlier, by 2030, was almost 50% of new car sales could be EVs, and they’re scaling that back to 40,” he said. “We’re going from less than 10% to 40. It’s still a growth market. I think we’re still in a good position.”
Walker said he hopes the news doesn’t overshadow the De Soto and Kansas community’s excitement about grand opening events on Monday.
“We’re super pumped that they’re having the grand opening Monday. It’s a big day and it’s a big thing in our area for sure,” he said.
Panasonic has already hired 1,100 employees, and 1,100 housing units are being built in De Soto, said Theo Stavropoulos, spokesman for the Kansas Department of Commerce.
“Local businesses are seeing the influx of new customers, driving local sales tax revenues up and reducing the local property tax mill levy,” he said. “As Panasonic’s production ramps up, Kansas will continue rising to meet the new economic opportunities made possible by their transformational investment.”
Stavropoulos did not answer questions about how slowing the production timeline might affect Kansas incentives offered to develop the project.

Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)HAYS — Ellis County artist Amy Warfield heard about the Kansas Senate’s online portal for public feedback through the Be the Bear Facebook group, where politically minded women shared the link among the group’s 36,000 members.
The Senate Committee on Government Efficiency, or COGE, set up the portal to gather input on how to streamline government like Elon Musk was doing under the DOGE umbrella at the federal level.
“I thought, ‘I definitely have at least something to say,’ and I shared it to a lot of people I know, because I knew they probably had input for how to make our state government more efficient,” Warfield said during a conversation for the Kansas Reflector podcast at the Paisley Pear restaurant in downtown Hays.


In early February, Warfield dashed off her thoughts on how the Legislature should rein in Attorney General Kris Kobach’s “vanity lawsuits,” which had targeted immigrants, trans kids, and the abortion pill mifepristone.
She wasn’t surprised when she didn’t hear back.
The vast majority of the first 1,600 public comments submitted through the COGE portal were at odds with the Republican leadership of the committee, which refused to make the comments public in accordance with open records law until the committee’s work for the session had ended. Kansas Reflector independently obtained leaked comments early, and revealed that people in the state were asking lawmakers to maintain abortion rights, avoid private school vouchers, expand Medicaid, stop hurting trans kids, and legalize marijuana.
COGE meanwhile worked to target social welfare programs and public employees.
“I kind of felt like from the beginning, when I heard about COGE, that it was just kind of a fishing expedition and that they were looking for the responses that they wanted,” Warfield said. “And I just assumed from the start that if they didn’t get the responses that they were looking for, then it would just kind of go away.
“So I felt like there probably was a benefit for us to speak the truth of how we feel about government efficiency, because I think that they shouldn’t just get the responses that they want. I think they need to get the truthful responses. And for me, this was a truthful response — continued frustration about the types of lawsuits we’re pursuing over and over again, because that’s our dollars being spent on that.”
Warfield said her attention to politics makes her somewhat of an outlier where she lives. Paying attention to the Legislature is “exhausting for people,” she said, and the Republicans who dominate politics in rural Kansas don’t have to engage with the public or defend their seats.
For Warfield, who is involved with Ellis County Democrats, local politics is about the “food and farm portion of our party.” Her idea of political activism is volunteering with Feeding Hays at a local church each week.
There’s “a huge disconnect” between what the GOP-led Legislature prioritizes “and what is really affecting everyday people in Ellis County,” she said.
“And,” she added, “what we’re focusing on, which is taking care of people in our community, supporting them, getting meals, things like that. I don’t really see the Legislature being focused on things like that.”
Warfield said she grew up in Garden City and attended community college there before getting a fine arts degree from Fort Hays State University. She works at the local domestic and sexual violence shelter and said she is “first and foremost an artist.”
She described herself as a landscape and figurative painter who works mostly in oil and watercolor. Her subject matter deals with the “landscape and people and atmosphere of western Kansas,” she said.
People who think there’s nothing to see in western Kansas might be surprised.
“My work not only focuses on the beauty that you can still find here, but also some of the ugliness too,” Warfield said. “And just that ramshackle shed in the right light can be really beautiful. And just that importance of lighting and appreciating unappreciated spaces.”
Warfield was dismayed this year when the Legislature decided to undercut arts funding, reducing the state’s investment from $1.5 million to $1 million.
For a place like Hays, she said, the budget cut might mean a reduction in programming, like art classes for children, as well as fewer exhibits or murals.
And, she said, it sends a signal to young people who appreciate the arts, and who may be inclined to leave the state, that lawmakers think they aren’t important or worth the investment.
“I think it just makes it more exhausting,” Warfield said. “You feel less appreciated by your government. I think it also leads to a certain amount of apathy of like, ‘Why pay attention and why care?’ Because they certainly don’t.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7090298-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-14 11:12:27.735136

After a period of unprecedented drought and wildfires in Massachusetts last fall and winter, the urgency around addressing drought seems to have dissipated.  
The post Drought management not included in Healey’s $3 billion environmental bond bill  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AFTER A PERIOD of unprecedented drought and wildfires last year spurred urgent calls for water conservation in Massachusetts, the arrival of flood season has seemingly washed away that momentum – with no policy to directly tackle drought included in Gov. Maura Healey’s environmental bond bill, which outlines the administration’s climate priorities. 
As climate change fuels worsening drought and wildfires across the Northeast, Massachusetts lawmakers have pushed for three bills – two in the Senate and one in the House – that would codify the state’s existing drought management task force and allow the head of the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to mandate water conservation during severe droughts, including the ability to limit nonessential outdoor water use. However, none of the bills were incorporated into the bond bill Healey filed on June 24. 
Healey’s environmental bond bill proposes nearly $3 billion to strengthen infrastructure, fund climate resilience projects across the state, protect water and natural resources, streamline permitting for housing and restoration, and help communities prepare for extreme weather and environmental challenges. It has drawn praise from environmental groups like The Nature Conservancy.  
The administration declined to answer questions about why the drought management legislation was not included in the bond bill, but suggested the issue is a priority. “With droughts increasing in severity and frequency, our administration is committed to being a partner with communities to help them prepare and respond,” the governor’s office said in a statement. “We will review any legislation that reaches the Governor’s desk.” 
During the height of last year’s drought season, the Healey administration called for more water conservation. In a November 19 press release, the state’s energy and environmental affairs secretary, Rebecca Tepper, said, “Water conservation is more important than ever. We urge municipalities, residents, and businesses — including those with private wells — to help us reduce stress on our water systems. We need to work together to ensure we have enough clean drinking water, protect wildlife habitats, and maintain effective fire control.” 
Drought management legislation would allow for a regional water conservation strategy. Proponents say that this is essential because drought and wildfires aren’t often contained within municipal boundaries.  
Bond bills filed by the governor are more likely to be taken up by the notoriously unproductive Legislature. Big policy packages like the state budget or bond bills are often vehicles for passing important policy. 
The drought management bill passed the Senate last session as part of the 2024 climate law, but the House didn’t take it up. This session, the bill has been reported favorably by the Senate from the Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources to the Senate Ways and Means Committee. It will continue making its way through on the Senate side but it’s not clear if the House will move on it. 
Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who filed one of the three drought management bills, advocated for the legislation to be included in Healey’s bond bill and expressed disappointment that it was not included. 
“With the continued impacts of climate change leading to extremes in water, whether it’s flooding or drought, the state needs stronger tools to regulate water use and to protect clean water access for residents and communities across Massachusetts,” said Eldridge. “In the past 10 years, we’ve seen a growing number of regions of the state designated as having drought conditions, and so there is urgency to passing the drought management bill.” 
Eldridge praised the bond bill for its increased investments in environmental programs but said that it is “pretty light on traditional environmental policy.” Measures banning plastic bags, addressing PFAS or “forever chemicals,” and raising tax credits for landowners who use their land for conservation are all policies that should have made it into the environmental bond bill, he said.  
Eldridge is expected to testify at a July 15 hearing to push lawmakers to tack on the drought management bill and several other pieces of legislation to the larger bond bill.  
Steve Long, the director of policy at The Nature Conservancy, largely praised Healey’s bill and said that some policies it includes that don’t directly address drought or wildfires will still lessen the impacts of both. Specifically, he noted that the bond bill includes funds to remove obsolete dams which can improve the health of rivers and $30 million that is directed toward forestry and tree planting.   
“Even though you might not see the words wildfire and you might not see the word drought in the bond bill, if you keep natural systems healthy, that will both reduce the chance of wildfires and the impacts of drought,” said Long. 
Average spring and summer temperatures in Massachusetts have climbed over the past five decades, and these warmer, sunnier seasons dry out soil and vegetation, making wildfires and droughts more likely and severe.  
Mass Rivers Alliance, an advocacy group, emphasized the urgency of passing drought management legislation as the climate continues to warm.  
“The urgency is that we are experiencing drought in new ways, and it’s happening on a fairly regular basis,” said Heather Clish, the group’s policy director. “We want to be prepared every time we experience drought to help sustain the water supply in our rivers during drought period.”

On May 13, 2025, Nathaniel Wallace Suter died suddenly while running with friends in Montpelier, Vermont. He was 52.
Nathan lived his life with remarkable energy, courage, and compassion. Born in the Canal Zone in Panama, he grew up in Poughkeepsie, New York, where he and his family were longtime members of the Bulls Head-Oswego Friends Meeting. In elementary and middle school, his intellectual curiosity was encouraged by the 6:30 Club, a reading group organized by Judge Albert Rosenblatt. Always athletic, Nathan became an accomplished distance runner in high school and maintained his love of running for the rest of his life. 
As a student at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, Nathan excelled in both track and cross-country and majored in photography; after graduation, he moved to the Bay Area to attend the San Francisco Art Institute, where he earned an MFA in photography. He then co-founded Root Division, a non-profit center for art and artists in downtown San Francisco that remains vital today. He taught at Eastside College Preparatory School in East Palo Alto, which serves students historically underrepresented in higher education.
In 2001, Nathan married Morgan Lloyd, a fellow Haverford graduate, and in 2006 they settled in Morgan’s home state of Vermont. Their daughter Amani was born in 2006, followed by their son Asa in 2008. His family became the center of his rich and busy life.
Nathan was as committed to social justice and service as he was passionate about athletics and art. He directed the Helen Day Art Center (now The Current) in Stowe, Vermont, for a decade, establishing youth and adult educational programs and a professional development program for emerging artists. In 2016 he co-founded BUILD Consulting, helping organizations and individuals develop strategic plans to achieve their missions. He was undaunted and even energized by the challenges he or his clients faced, and he had an inspiring belief in his own potential and in that of others. Nathan served as a board member of Migrant Justice and treasurer of the Peace and Justice Center in Burlington, Vermont. After the devastating floods across northern New England in the summer of 2023, he joined the Montpelier Commission for Recovery and Resilience. He coached track and field and assisted in coaching the cross-country and Nordic skiing teams at the Montpelier Roxbury public schools. His efforts helped to revitalize the track and field program in central Vermont. Athletes of all skill levels thrived under his mentorship, and knew they would hear his booming voice cheering them on from the sidelines.
Though Nathan was deeply rooted in his community, he was also an adventurous traveler, who traveled all over the world. He spent time in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica with his family and had formative trips to Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela with friends. Both at home and abroad, Nathan often captured his joy and appreciation through photography. A consummate connector, Nathan never hesitated to strike up conversations with strangers in English or Spanish, and he made lasting friendships during every trip and every chapter of his life.
The messages Morgan, Amani, and Asa have received in the weeks since Nathan’s death are extraordinary not only for their number but for their consistency: over and over, those who knew Nathan remember that he made them feel loved, appreciated, and worthwhile, and that he challenged and inspired them to be their best selves. They recall his excellent hugs, his laughter, and his bottomless generosity. “Nathan was a light,” one colleague wrote, “and he seemed to use every minute of his time spreading that light to those around him.” Those lucky enough to have known Nathan will always treasure their time with him, and always wish there had been more. 
Nathan is survived by his wife Morgan Lloyd, his daughter Amani Suter, and his son Asa Lloyd of Montpelier; his father Robert Suter of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his sister Katherine Fisher and her family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; many other beloved family members; and hundreds of friends. Nathan’s mother, Valerie Suter, passed away on May 22, 2025, after suffering a fall in Montpelier.

A celebration of Barbara’s life is scheduled for Monday, August 11th at 11am at the First United Methodist Church in Burlington on 21 Buell Street. There will be no visiting hours. Internment will occur at the convenience of the family.
In lieu of flowers. The Norton family requests that a donation be made to either the First United Methodist Church in Burlington or the United Church of Fairfax, 8 Fletcher Rd., Fairfax, VT 05454.

Barbara Norton, 84, died peacefully in her sleep during the early morning hours of July 1, 2025, at Birchwood Terrace Rehabilitation and Healthcare.
Barbara Jean Perry Norton was born on October 5, 1940, to Francis and Melba (Chandler) Perry. She grew up in Fairfax, VT and graduated from Bellows Free Academy – Fairfax in 1958. She completed a secretarial program at Champlain College the following year. Barbara married Arthur Norton on November 16, 1963, and after a short time living in Burlington, they raised three sons in Fairfax. When she wasn’t working or being a parent, she enjoyed sewing, quilting, and reading.
Barbara worked several jobs during her life including The Burlington Free Press, Northwestern Medical Center in St. Albans, IBM in Essex Jct., and as the assistant town clerk in Fairfax. She was also a member of Order of Eastern Stars in Fairfax as well as being one of the early volunteers for Fairfax Rescue.
In the 1980’s, Barbara felt the desire to become a minister but had only completed one year of college. After completing the requirements to become a Certified Lay Pastor, she led congregations in North Hyde Park and Eden Mills, VT. She took courses at CCV and transferred to Johnson State College where she graduated in 1994. She enrolled in Boston University’s School of Theology and earned a Master of Divinity in May of 1998. After graduating from BU, she became a minister in Eastport, Maine.
After retiring from the ministry, she and Arthur moved back to Vermont and settled in Chittenden County, eventually residing at Cathedral Square in downtown Burlington. In the years after Arthur’s death in 2012, Barbara was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and Dementia. She spent the final seven years of her life in the memory care unit of Birchwood Terrace Nursing Home in Burlington.
Barbara is survived by her sons and daughters in law Jim and Carol of Newburyport, MA, Joel and Pam Norton of Essex Jct., VT, and Jon and Christina Norton of West Springfield, MA. She is also survived by her 7 grandchildren Jonathan, Spencer, Jack, Gwen, Nick, Abigail, and Lillian well as several cousins. She was predeceased by her parents, her husband, and her brother, Rev. James M. Perry.
Barbara’s family would like to thank the staff at Birchwood Terrace for their excellent care for her during the past seven years. Her sons would especially like to thank their aunt and Barbara’s sister-in-law, Kareen Perry of Colchester, for her support of their mother since their father’s death in 2012.

[…],"The Missouri State Board of Education meets for a board retreat at Canterbury Hill Winery and Restaurant Wednesday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).New members of the Missouri State Board of Education discovered their powers to direct schools are more limited than they expected during a retreat last week.
The board spent Wednesday and Thursday talking about the powers it has — and those it does not — to impact a public education system they’d like to tweak.
“People around this table are accountable for change. I don’t think people want the status quo for education,” Brooks Miller, a board member from Sunshine Beach, said Wednesday. “That is why I get nervous when I think about how little authority we have but how much accountability we are subject to.”
Miller, a newly minted board member, was one of multiple board members beginning to learn just how limited their power can be during the two-day meeting.
Board retreats are not a new concept for the Board of Education. The group last held a retreat in 2023 and featured the same guest speaker.
This one, though, stands out as the first with Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger — who has been in her position for a year — and with a board where half of the six members are new.
In April, Gov. Mike Kehoe appointed Miller, Mike Matousek of Kansas City and Jon Otto of Kansas City to the board (alongside a fourth appointee who was not confirmed by the State Senate). Following their appointment hearings that month, they told The Independent that they see opportunity for change — with some more eager to shake things up than others.
  Evergy General Counsel Jon Otto stands with Sen.Barbara Washington, D-Kansas City, for a picture as part of his appointment to the State Board of Education in a committee hearing April 16 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Otto said he wanted to settle in and “see what is working” before launching initiatives, but he saw potential for “a lot of new things.”
Matousek, who previously worked for U.S. Rep. Sam Graves’s office and was a member of his local school board in Platte County, said he joined the state board to help transform education.
“Public education is changing in Missouri, and I’d rather be at the table,” he said.
Change, though, is hard to initiate from the board level, he learned during the retreat.
Core responsibilities
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education hired David Renz, director emeritus with the Midwest Center for Nonprofit Leadership at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, to lead the board in an overview of its role.
Renz, who gave a similar presentation in 2023, shared a sobering reality.
“There is no board at any local level like this board,” Renz said. “And that has certain benefits, and that has certain problems.”
He described members of the board as “influencers,” ones who can steer people toward change but can’t spur high-level changes on their own.
The board’s largest power is hiring and directing the education commissioner, Renz told them. A key demonstration of this happened in 2017, when then-Gov. Eric Greitens ousted former education commissioner Margie Vandeven by stacking the board with five members willing to vote her out.
Vandeven returned to her job after Greitens resigned in disgrace in 2018 and the board membership again changed.
In recent years, the board has not conducted annual commissioner performance reviews. Eslinger, a former state senator who succeeded Vandeven, wants annual evaluations and board President Mary Schrag agrees.
Another area of influence is the strategic plan set by the board, which guides the commissioner’s leadership of the department. This document, which was discussed at length Thursday, outlines areas of focus and, oftentimes, change.
Schrag, a six-year board veteran from West Plains, said the board has been able to do “a lot in the last few years.”
In 2022, the board convened a blue ribbon commission to study the state’s teacher shortage. The commission’s recommendations became the blueprint for new laws passed last year, like a boost to teacher pay.
The board’s look at the formula that funds public schools, including a study it commissioned in 2023, spurred the creation of a task force dedicated to improving the formula.
“This board can be such a good voice for how to drive education,” said Kerry Casey, a board member from Chesterfield. “It is hard that we don’t own it, but we can be a voice.”

Pushback
Casey said she understands new members’ frustrations.
“It was certainly like that for me when I came on the board because we all want to make a difference,” she said. “We are a voice, but we don’t have the distinct responsibility to set the legislation.”
  State Board of Education appointee Mike Matousek, a Republican from Kansas City, speaks during a Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee hearing April 16 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Matousek took issue with the idea that the board has less power to set policy than local school boards. He served on the Platte County R-3 School Board until April, and he told the state board he felt “powerless” in that position.
He hoped as an appointed board member, not subject to elections, he could feel free, he said.
But, Wednesday, Matousek learned that board members rarely put items on the meeting agenda. He inquired whether he could send an email a week before the meeting to add an item.
No, Eslinger said, there’s a larger process. But no one fully explained much, except that the board typically reviews agenda items two months in advance.
“There will come a time when I am adding stuff to the agenda, and I want to know how to do it when that time comes,” Matousek said.
He also asked how the board can “initiate rulemaking.”
The board doesn’t write regulations on its own, Eslinger said. The department’s rules and regulations stem from legislation.
“We can only promulgate rules where we have authority, and it’s a pretty narrow lane,” the department’s general counsel Sarah Madden explained.
What if members of the public ask for a rule, Matousek inquired.
The department has to have authority granted by state lawmakers, Madden repeated.
Only a handful of the state’s education officials engage publicly with the legislative process, which primarily occurs when they explain the department’s budget request. But the department has a legislative liaison, Perry Gorrell, who testifies on proposed legislation and explains how bills might impact the department.
Miller asked how the board can speak against bills. He heard negative feedback about a bill passed this legislative session and wished there was an opportunity to fight bills from his position.
Casey said the board must be in agreement on their stance and, at times, has taken votes on “strong, important pieces of legislation.”
“The school board’s association and the teachers association are weighing in on lawmakers,” Matousek said. “My intent would be to weigh in more.”
The board avoids rejecting or promoting legislation, Schrag said, but it has requested “a seat at the table.”
“It is our role to be oversight, so it is a little bit more of a conflict for us to get more aggressive and more involved,” she said.
The board may change more in coming months, with two positions open. The governor may appoint a teacher representative to the board, whose position has historically been vacant since the position was created in 2018.

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.
There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

Bowhead whales are ingesting toxins driven by warming in Arctic, study finds

	Fur seals found dead last August on Alaska’s St. Paul Island had significant levels of saxitoxin in their bodies, as did several of the dead fish around them.
It was the clearest evidence ever found for this type of toxin-caused death, scientists say.
“I would say this is the absolute strongest case for saxitoxin poisoning in marine mammals anywhere,” said Kathi Lefebvre, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research biologist and the lead author of a study detailing the findings, published in the journal Marine Mammals Science in May.
The discovery, a warning for local communities that rely on subsistence hunting, comes as long-term warming in the Bering and Chukchi seas is increasing the prevalence of a type of algae that produces saxitoxin is becoming more prevalent in these bodies of water.
Dangerous blooms of the Alexandrium have long been observed in more southern waters of Alaska, where paralytic shellfish poisoning is a well-recognized and sometimes deadly hazard. Clams are notorious for accumulating saxitoxin, and there are frequent safety advisories that warn people of specific sites’ shellfish poisoning dangers, and two labs in the state — one in Anchorage operated by the Department of Environmental Conservation and one in Sitka operated by the Sitka Tribe of Alaska — test harvested shellfish to determine whether it is safe for human consumption.

	Farther north, the emergence of large Alexandrium blooms and potentially dangerous saxitoxin levels is new. But, as Lefebvre explains it, the conditions to create those toxin hazards have been set up over decades and possibly even centuries.
Over time, ocean currents have carried bits of Alexandrium algae north, and over time, that algae has dropped to the bottom of the ocean. That created massive beds of dormant cysts, the equivalent of algal seeds.
The Bering, Chukchi and even Beaufort seas hold some of the highest concentrations of Alexandrium cysts ever found in the world, according to Don Anderson, a harmful algal specialist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Anderson led research teams that mapped out Alaska cyst beds over several years, including a bed in the Chukchi that he said is the biggest ever discovered.
Those cyst beds were dormant until recently, said Lefebvre, who works closely with Anderson.
“They’ve just been building and building and building. And then in the last couple decades – actually, the last 10 years, maybe — the bottom temperature finally was warm enough for cyst germination,” Lefebvre said. That appears to be the cause of the large blooms now being found routinely in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas, she said.
Dead fur seals and fish
In the case of the St. Paul fur seals, local beachcombers found 10 dead animals at a site on the northeastern side of the island called Benson Beach. It is a catchment site where marine debris, kelp and other items are known to accumulate, said Lauren Divine, director of the island’s Tribal ecosystem conservation office.
Tribal representatives managed to retrieve some of the dead seals, as well as some of the dead fish with them, said Divine, who works for the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island. They photographed the scene and gathered whatever information they could, and they contacted the NOAA-coordinated Alaska Marine Mammal Stranding Network and Anchorage-based veterinarian pathologist Kathy Burek-Huntington to continue the investigation, she said.
It was clearly a startling discovery, Divine said.
“This was something that everyone was quite alarmed (at) and noticed as something that was wrong in the ecosystem and something that really hadn’t ever been noticed or detected before,” she said. “So we were pretty adamant about really trying to do the best job that we could to collect as much information as we could about the event, and also with quite little capacity that we have out in the remote community.”
In all five of the adult seals tested, saxitoxin was found in feces or urine, significant because they indicate higher exposure when tainted food was eaten. Two fish were sampled as well, and both turned up saxitoxin in their intestines.
At about the same time, samples being taken by researchers in the southeastern Bering Sea — the same area where the dead fur seals would have been foraging — revealed dense Alexandrium blooms, large cyst beds and extremely high prevalence of saxitoxin in fish, zooplankton, clams and worms.
Anderson, who noted that his team has already found a huge Alexandrium cyst bed near St. Paul, the seal discovery is significant for two reasons.
“The seal mortality demonstrates that dangerous levels of toxin can accumulate there and that local communities need to be careful about what they consume during certain times of the year,” he said by email.

	Additionally, because scientists know that ocean currents run north from that region, “this might be yet another source of cells that can affect the Alaskan Arctic,” he said.
Lefebvre said all the evidence about the seals’ bodies, the fish samples and the environmental conditions were needed to show that the algal toxins killed the seals.
Up to now, it has not been possible to prove such a strong link between saxitoxin and marine mammal deaths, she said.
Mammals poisoned by saxitoxin are likely to disappear while at sea, she said. “They become paralyzed. They’re going to basically suffocate, not even drown, not even taking a breath of air, of water,” she said. “They’re going to just stop breathing.”
That contrasts with effects of a different type of algal toxin that, since the 1990s, has caused mass strandings and deaths since 1990 of marine mammals in California. That toxin, domoic acid, is produced by the Pseudo-nitzschia algae. Rather than causing paralysis, it overstimulates the nervous system, causing seizures that can result in death.
Lefebvre and others have documented thousands of cases of domoic acid poisoning among marine mammals in California, including sea lions, dolphins, seals, and whales, with animals easily seen by people on the beach. Mass die-offs of seabirds have also been documented.
So far, there have been no domoic acid poisoning cases documented in Alaska, though Lefebvre and her colleagues have consistently found low levels of it in various marine mammal species.
But a new study suggests that continued warming may make domoic acid a future problem in Alaska. The study, also led by Lefebvre, found that bowhead whales hunted over a two-decade period carried higher levels of both saxitoxin and domoic acid in years when waters were warm and sea ice was low.
Saxitoxin risks in various wild foods?
For now, saxitoxin and the paralytic shellfish poisoning it causes remain the main algal toxin concern in Alaska.
Among people, there were 132 reports of paralytic shellfish poisoning between 1993 to 2021, with the highest prevalence in Southeast Alaska and the Kodiak Archipelago, according to a bulletin published in 2022 by the Department of Health’s epidemiology section. The last fatal case concerned a person who ate shellfish at Unalaska Island.
Information about saxitoxin poisoning in wildlife has been more difficult to pinpoint.
In past years, it was suspected in some marine mammal deaths in Alaska, but it was not proven.
In the fall of 2017, four dead walruses found in the Bering Strait region had saxitoxin in their stomachs or intestines. They were among 39 walruses that, though otherwise in good body condition, were found dead in the region that August and September.
Two years later, another piece of the puzzle came when scientists retrieved clams from the Bering Strait area and the Chukchi Sea that had levels of saxitoxin above the thresholds for safe consumption by humans. That added another piece to the puzzle. Clams are an important part of the Pacific walrus diet, though the saxitoxin threshold for walruses has yet to be determined.
There are other suspected cases. For example, saxitoxin poisoning was a suggested cause of a 1987 sea otter die-off in the Kodiak Archipelago, though test results were inconclusive.
Beyond mammals, Alaska seabirds are known to have been killed by saxitoxin. That toxin caused a 2019 die-off of Arctic terns in the Juneau area; the birds had been feeding on sand lance, a type of fish known to accumulate saxitoxin.

	For people in St. Paul and elsewhere in Western Alaska, who live far away from the two Alaska labs that currently test shellfish for toxins, the new information is concerning, Divine said.
St. Paul residents and others in the Pribilof Islands harvest various types of animals beyond the clams and mussels that are routinely screened for consumption safety, she said. But there is not much known yet about saxitoxin levels in the full breadth of subsistence foods, she said. “We just don’t have robust information on how much is accumulating and how things are impacted across the food web,” she said.
A grant from a NOAA program called ECOHAB funded much of the work that supported the new study. The grant for that work, which is led by Lefebvre and Anderson, runs through this year. 
Anderson said the team just learned that it has been awarded ECOHAB grant funding for another year of work, part of what had been planned as a five-year follow-up program to better understand the saxitoxin risk in wild foods gathered in Indigenous subsistence harvests.
News of the one-year award is encouraging, but the scientists are worried about future years, Anderson said
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe Trump administration has targeted NOAA for deep cuts, he noted. The administration is proposing to entirely terminate NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Sciences, the agency arm that supports research into algal toxins.
Termination of the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Sciences would end funding for NOAA’s entire Integrated Ocean Observing System. Within the IOOS is the Alaska Ocean Observing System, which monitors algal blooms, among other work.
Divine said the same people who have been drawn together by their concerns about toxins in the food web are also worried about the potential loss of scientific research.
“We have just an incredible amount of interest in this, and the funding that has been secured to really tackle this in a coordinated way is all on hold in this administration. And I do think that that’s worth noting,” she said.

The surprise win of a progressive candidate in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary is serving as an indication for some California progressives that they could have a shot at winning key offices in upcoming elections.
As CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu explains, earlier this month New York Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani defeated eight other candidates including former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose affiliated political action committee raised a record-setting amount of money. Mamdani is a democratic socialist, and progressives in California have considered his victory as evidence that their stances on universal health care, taxing the rich and boosting the economy with climate-related jobs could resonate with voters.
The sentiment comes as some liberal California elected officials have shifted closer to the center in recent years, and in March critics on both sides of the political aisle slammed Gov. Gavin Newsom for making what they saw as a disingenuous appeal to conservatives with his podcast.
Despite an overwhelmingly Democratic populace, voters in November also passed a measure to stiffen penalties for drug and theft crimes and rejected progressive policies that would have expanded rent control, ended forced prison labor and raised the minimum wage. President Donald Trump also increased his vote share in nearly every county, and Republicans flipped three seats in the state Legislature. 
So what is it about Mamdani that California voters may find appealing?
One factor could be that Mamdani appealed to young voters about affordability issues, writes Stella. His proposal to freeze rent helped him garner 46% of the vote in renter-heavy neighborhoods. While most of California’s likely voters are homeowners, courting renters and younger voters to show up on Election Day could prove beneficial for progressives.

Mindy Romero, founder and director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California: “Progressives and Democrats and Republicans would all be very foolish not to be courting the youth vote. The problem is that they all do a generally pretty bad job of courting the youth vote.”

Judge orders ICE to halt raids in LA

A federal judge issued an order Friday directing federal immigration enforcement agents to temporarily halt carrying out immigration raids in Los Angeles without “reasonable suspicion,” write CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos.
A coalition of immigration and civil rights groups and local government agencies filed the class action lawsuit earlier this month, accusing federal authorities of violating constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The coalition argues that federal agents conduct warrantless stops on people who simply appear to be Latino, and deny them due process rights to access to counsel.
The judge’s order prohibits agents from using four rationales, either alone or in combination, for conducting detention stops: “Apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a particular location (e.g. bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, ect), the type of work one does.”
The ruling does not prohibit the federal government from obtaining search warrants and carrying out workplace raids.
The Trump administration filed an appeal of the Friday ruling on Sunday, court records show. A hearing on whether this temporary restraining order may turn into a longer preliminary injunction is expected in the coming weeks.

Deaf asylum seeker held by ICE in CA detention center

Wendy also reports on how a California district court judge last week ordered officials at a San Diego immigration detention center to provide crucial assistance to a deaf asylum seeker who has been detained for more than four months.
The detainee, identified as Avirmed, arrived in the U.S. in February after fleeing Mongolia and seeking asylum from persecution because of his disability. Border officials transferred him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where he was placed in detention at the for-profit Otay Mesa Detention Center. Since his proceedings and detainment, Avirmed has not had access to a Mongolian Sign Language interpreter, according to the Disability Rights Legal Center.
The judge’s order directs officials at the detention facility to provide Avirmed with an appropriate interpreter. Immigration authorities were also ordered to redo two assessments, including a mental health review, that could affect Avirmed’s asylum request.
Avirmed’s case underscores the difference in border policies between Trump and President Joe Biden. Under Biden, asylum seekers who were not threats to public safety were often released on bond. Under Trump, some asylum seekers are detained while their cases move through immigration court, leading to record-high detention numbers.

Eleven major solar projects and one onshore wind project now face potential delays or cancellation.","In summary
Clean-energy projects have new deadlines for federal tax credits and limits on foreign parts, taking aim at California’s climate agenda. Eleven major solar projects and one onshore wind project now face potential delays or cancellation.


California’s drive to run its electric grid entirely on wind, solar and other clean sources of energy just got harder after President Donald Trump signed a sweeping new budget law.
The changes in federal tax incentives could affect the feasibility of new solar and wind projects as the state is counting on them to provide more electricity for Californians. A state law requires 100% of electricity to be powered by renewable, carbon-free sources by 2045, at the same time it’s moving to electrify cars and trucks. 
Incentives championed by former President Joe Biden were rolled back, shortening the timeline for the industry to obtain tax credits. Developers of wind and solar projects now face a new, shorter deadline for obtaining tax credits — most now expire at the end of 2027 instead of no sooner than 2032.
In addition, the new federal rules bar companies from accessing tax credits if they rely on major components from China or other “foreign entities of concern.” This restriction could hit California’s solar and wind industry especially hard, experts said.
The changes to tax credits are estimated to save the federal government approximately $499 billion from 2025–2034.
“For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” Trump wrote in an executive order last week. “The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape.”
Projects can still be built without tax credits. But it puts more of a financial burden on their investors. In California, 11 solar projects and one onshore wind project now face potential delays or cancellation, according to an analysis of federal data by Atlas Public Policy provided to CalMatters. The projects are spread across the Central Valley, Inland Empire and Northern California.
Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement that the industry was still “assessing what the federal tax bill means for them.” He warned the changes could jeopardize up to 35,700 solar jobs and 25 solar manufacturing facilities in California — including existing positions and factories as well as future projects that may now never materialize.
“The reality is, with or without clean energy tax credits, California’s energy demand is growing at a historic rate, and solar and storage are the fastest and most affordable way to meet that demand,” Gallagher said. 
California in recent years has been fast-tracking massive floating offshore wind farms 20 miles off the coasts of Humboldt County and Morro Bay. The federal changes add some uncertainty that could chill investment. But experts say it’s not a death knell for the industry because the projects weren’t set to seek federal permits or generate electricity for at least several years.
“Offshore wind is what we would call a long-lead project. It does take years and years to develop,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, former chair of the Assembly’s Offshore Wind Select Committee. “Solar is a little bit shorter of a time frame…but it’s also his incredibly erratic behavior when it comes to market stability overall that is also going to affect these projects in a negative way.”
Experts say in the long-run, the federal changes could drive up energy costs. 
“Tax credit savings are typically passed onto ratepayers through lower contracting costs. In the long term, the repeal of the tax credits will result in higher future electricity rates for customers,” the California Energy Commission told CalMatters.
Rising utility bills are already a major political headache for state leaders and a challenge for clean energy advocates who want the state to lead the way in making electricity cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable.
“The whole point of California’s climate policy is not just to reduce California’s carbon footprint — because we are less than 1% of global emissions — but to set an example and show that this can be done,” Berkeley economist Severin Borenstein told CalMatters. “There are going to be fewer other states following our example because it’s going to be more expensive.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/051023_Mojave-Wind-Turbines_LV_CM_09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-14 09:09:35.732387

[[...]","Members of the South Dakota House of Representatives meet on Feb. 4, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota lawmakers spent less taxpayer money attending out-of-state conferences and events during the recently concluded fiscal year.
When one legislator attends an out-of-state event, that’s counted as one trip. Members of the Legislature took 23 out-of-state trips that cost a total of $38,250 during the 2025 fiscal year, which ended June 30. That’s down from 66 trips for $103,500 during the prior fiscal year and 60 trips for $83,800 during the 2023 fiscal year.
Out-of-state travel is approved by the Legislature’s Executive Board. The Legislative Research Council maintains records of each approved request, including the destination, event name and cost.
Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said an increasing volume of work during the legislative offseason is likely driving down the number of out-of-state trips. The Legislature meets from January to March every year at the Capitol in Pierre, and some committees continue meeting the rest of the year — including special summer committees that study issues for potential future legislation.
This year, there are five summer study committees involving 52 total positions studying topics ranging from property taxes to incarceration rates, plus a Project Prison Reset task force appointed by the governor, involving legislators and non-legislators studying potential prison construction. In 2024, two summer study committees had a total of 26 positions, and in 2023, two committees had 28 positions.
“You can only allocate so much of your life to this,” Karr said. “Between the new prison and property tax task forces, and the various committee meetings, I think fewer lawmakers simply have the time.”
House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, had a different take on what’s driving down the number of out-of-state trips. He said that “with conservative leadership, the members are behaving a bit more conservatively.” Republicans replaced their leadership team last fall after 14 incumbent Republican legislators lost in the June primary election.
Among the most frequented gatherings over the last three fiscal years were the National Conference of State Legislators summit (17 trips), the International Legislators Forum (16), and the Council of State Governments conference (15). The events are billed as bipartisan opportunities for lawmakers to share policy ideas and improve interstate cooperation. 
“The return on investment for the public is there,” Karr said. “You get to see how things are done in other states, and can bring that back. Better lawmakers make better laws.” 
The events are hosted in different states each year, ranging from Kentucky and Louisiana to Indiana and Hawaii. Two lawmakers who went on a Hawaii trip in December 2022 suffered criticism because they knew at the time that they would not be returning to office in 2023. Both of those lawmakers were back in the Legislature this year.    
Since the 2023 fiscal year, several Republican lawmakers attended events hosted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative policy organization. Other ideologically themed events attended by South Dakota legislators included a Pro-Family Legislator Conference hosted by Wallbuilders, a group that supported recent failed legislation to require the Ten Commandments to be displayed and taught in South Dakota public schools, and the Statesmen Academy hosted by the Family Policy Alliance Foundation, which aims to “equip Christian leaders for impactful service.”
Those events are also hosted in a variety of states, ranging from Arizona and Colorado to Florida and Texas.

(Marvel Way Complex photo)A new sober living facility in Reno was selected as one of the first in the nation to receive federal funding for rooftop solar development under a Biden-era program that was nearly canceled by the Trump administration earlier this year.
The Empowerment Center – a nonprofit offering affordable housing for low income and at-risk women recovering from substance abuse – will receive more than $960,000 in “Solar for All” funding to install solar at their newly constructed multi-unit housing property.
Last year, Nevada was awarded a $156 million “Solar for All” grant by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to support rooftop or community solar projects that benefit low-income households. 
Nevada was one of several states cut off from the funding after President Donald Trump called for the immediate halt of energy grants, loans, and contracts funded through the Inflation Reduction Act passed under former president Joe Biden.
The Solar for All program was the only grant under the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to survive the cull. In March EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cancellation of the fund’s other two federal grants, eliminating $20 billion in renewable energy investment. 
With the survival of the program, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank that administers the “Solar for All” funds — selected the sober living facility as the first project to get the green-light.
“This first-of-its-kind project demonstrates how clean energy can help uplift people working hard to restore their lives,” said Kirsten Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.
Roxanne DeCarlo, the executive director of The Empowerment Center, said the solar installation will be vital to reducing utility costs and helping free up funds for addiction treatment, case management, and support staff. 
“When individuals arrive at our program, they are unemployed, homeless, or were recently incarcerated, so we’re really working with individuals that have a very low income. It’s really important that we keep our operations cost as low as possible,” DeCarlo said. 
Solar has already proven to be a significant cost-saving measure at the nonprofit’s two other affordable housing facilities, said DeCarlo. The organization hopes to power nearly all of the new building’s electricity needs with solar energy.
Nevada received the highest “Solar for All” funding per capita of any state. In fact, Nevada received the same award amount as Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania — states with significantly higher populations.
With robust funding, Nevada’s “Solar for All” program was expected to boost development of rooftop and community solar for low-income households that don’t have access to solar energy due to high upfront installation costs.
But the future of the program has also grown increasingly uncertain after Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, cutting the 30% Clean Electricity Investment Credit for solar projects that start construction after July 4, 2026 — phasing it out six years ahead of schedule. Projects will also need to be in service by the end of 2027 to receive the full credit. 
For residential solar, the 30% credit ends entirely at the end of 2025.
Greg Zegas, the managing director of investments at the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, said the early termination of tax credits pressures solar project developers to start construction before the end of the year. The deadline particularly impacts working families who rely on the tax credit to make solar affordable as electricity prices continue to climb.
“That’s a tax credit that is really beneficial for clean energy projects like solar,” Zegas said. “It basically means that any project that’s starting construction after 2025 is going to face additional hurdles for claiming the full value of the tax credit.”
In order to fill the funding gap left by the dissolution of those credits, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund may need to cover more solar installation costs in the state while funding less projects. 
“If we’re putting more money out towards grants, then it would reduce the amount of funding that we have for projects,” Zegas said. 
Despite a tight deadline and other challenges, Zegas said the Nevada Clean Energy Fund is optimistic they can get the $156 million allocated to Nevada “out the door to benefit households across the state.”
In the next few weeks, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund plans to finalize funding for several other “Solar for All” projects, said Zegas.
Those solar projects will benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities who rely on multifamily affordable housing projects, similar to the residents at The Empowerment Center. 
Community solar projects can be hosted by local governments, schools, businesses, or nonprofit that have a building, carport, or other land where solar can be placed.
“This program is really focused on benefiting low-income communities. Those populations face the highest utility bill burden proportionate to their income. That’s our goal with these projects, to reduce those energy costs and share those savings for households,” Zegas said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Marvel-Exterior-1-635x425-1.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

BESSEMER — The school year was over, but classes were in session on a recent June morning at Jonesboro Elementary School in Bessemer. 
In one room, a small class of third graders practiced pronunciation and reading as they got ready to re-take the state’s standardized reading test. 
In the past few weeks, they have learned about construction. The students applied area formulas to determine how much tile they would need to cover a floor. The week before, the class held a contest — a gift card was the main prize — for who could make the best adaptation of the “Three Little Pigs” story using only materials they had.

“So each one, they pull a house from the pack and whatever you got, that’s what you built with,” fifth grade teacher Candace Wells said. “So we had a house full of straws, index cards and popsicle sticks. They had to use what they had to make it work.”
They also learned area formulas to determine how much material they would need to tile a floor. The class is part of Bessemer City Schools’ Fun Zone summer program to help prepare students for the next grade and teach them life skills, including balancing a budget. 
“Most of these kids have never seen a check before,” said Tieshia Collins, the Alabama Reading Initiative director at Bessemer City Schools and site leader for various summer programs at Jonesboro Elementary School. 
A group of first graders down the hallway was learning how to write the alphabet. Patrick Evans, their teacher, said that the state has provided additional resources that make it easier to teach students.
“I have an amazing team of teachers. The teachers work very well together,” Evans said. “I’ve seen these teachers work very hard. And so using that explicit instruction and that systematic instruction, especially in this small group environment, I think we’ve been making a lot of gains in the right direction.”
The resources were made available in part through the state. 
The Alabama State Department of Education took over Bessemer City Schools a year ago to address issues with leadership and finances. Both state and local officials say the intervention is helping with student achievement and training for teachers and administrators.
“We truly believe that professional development is going to be very, very important to help our school leaders, to help our teachers be successful in this district,” said Daniel Boyd, the state-appointed administrator for the Bessemer intervention, in an interview last month. “But in order to provide professional development it is important for us to determine where the deficits are at.”

Why the state intervened

Bessemer City Schools, located south of Birmingham, is considered an economically disadvantaged system. Under state funding weighted for student need, BCS receives 45% of its additional funding for students in poverty. According to its website, all 2,972 of BCS’s students receive free or reduced lunch. Of its students, 78.7% are Black and 16.2% are Hispanic.
The state cited the Bessemer City Schools Board of Education’s alleged dysfunction as a reason for intervention. According to a show cause letter sent to the board by State School Superintendent Eric Mackey on July 3, 2024, the Bessemer Board of Education canceled six meetings in the first six months of 2024 due to losing or lack of a quorum. 
“Serially canceling meetings or failing to meet a quorum arouses suspicion from which students, teachers, administrators and the community may infer an intentional lack of transparency and failure to address serious concerns such as manpower and critical maintenance operations,” Mackey wrote. 
According to the meeting minutes, there were 18 meetings in the time period. Twelve of those were called meetings. 
“Chaos is never good for schools and the Bessemer board meetings were chaotic. I don’t think there’s anybody that would question that,” Mackey said in an interview last month. 
Bessemer is one of three school systems the state has intervened in, and finances were an issue in each one. The state intervened in Sumter County Schools in western Alabama in 2023 mainly due to concerns about finances and personnel. The State Board of Education approved intervention in Dallas County Schools in the Black Belt in March because the system had leftover federal funds due to an ineffective processing system. 
In Bessemer’s case, the school failed to turn in its FY 2024 budget on time, according to Mackey.

“September 2022 was the last time that Bessemer City Schools submitted an on time budget to Alabama State Department of Education,” Boyd said in an interview last month. “Now, we did it this last go around. But the only reason why I feel that it was submitted on time was because of state intervention.”
Under the Intervention Act of 2013, the state superintendent decides whether or not the local board of education meets during intervention. Sumter and Dallas counties schools’ boards are still meeting regularly, but Mackey said Bessemer’s board could not work together to make decisions.
“I’ve put them on a hiatus because they were not functioning well,” Mackey said.
The board will undergo professional development and training until August, then resume regular meetings in September, Daniel Boyd said in an interview last month.
Mackey also listed “clearly dilapidated school facilities” as a reason for intervention. Reginald Mitchell, the maintenance director at BCS, said in an interview that some of the repairs the local board wanted in schools were cosmetic and did not fix the underlying issues of the 50+ year-old buildings.
“At the end of the day, you can put a pig on lipstick, but it’s still a pig,” Mitchell said. “Our buildings are so old in age, and we keep dumping money in them and it makes them look good. But what about our pipes and sewage lines and water lines?”
Mitchell said since intervention, the maintenance side of the school system is doing better than it ever has in his 20 years at BCS. 
“I’m just elated at the status here when it comes to my particular area with facilities and stuff trying to get stuff done,” Mitchell said. 
Mackey said that the productiveness of maintenance is simply due to the state approving projects, instead of the board. There are no additional funds for maintenance, he said.
“There were multiple times when the board would not act on recommendations of the superintendent, not act on the recommendations of their architects, not act on the recommendations of their attorney,” Mackey said. “It just didn’t act. You can’t move forward if somebody’s not making a decision in Bessemer.”

Student learning

In 2019, the state released a list of “failing schools” that included Bessemer City High School. Bessemer Board of Education member Margie Varner, an opponent of intervention, claimed that since only one of the system’s nine schools was on the list negates the claim of low student learning.
“I am not saying that I’m proud. I am simply saying that we are not at the bottom,” Varner said at a community meeting in June.
On the 2023-24 state report card, a collection of data that determines a school system’s success, Bessemer City Schools scored a 69 (D). Boyd said in an interview on June 23 that he expects Bessemer’s score to be a C when the 2024-25 report card is released this fall. 
“I don’t want it to be made official, but we feel pretty confident that the release of this report card will be the first C that this school district has ever made, which is huge,” Boyd said.
According to Alabama Comprehensive Assessment of Progress (ACAP) reading scores, BCS regressed in third graders that are at or above grade level. In 2024, 15.29% of BCS third graders scored below grade level, and in 2025, 31.87% scored below grade level. At least part of the reason may be a higher cutoff grade. The state this year raised the score that determines grade-level reading from 435 to 444. 
Students that scored below the cut score were studying at school last month to take the ACAP test again to prevent being held back. DeNitta Easterling, the principal coach and director of school leadership at Jonesboro Elementary, said the school collaborates with parents to make sure the students are successful.
“They get another chance,” she said. “There have been some identified deficits that these children have that may keep them from being on grade level.”
The school also hosts Camp Bessemer at Jonesboro Elementary. The program employs Bessemer high school students through the city to help teachers with summer programs. The students in summer school have a combination of learning academics and life skills.
“It’s a great introduction to the work force,” Collins said. 

New leadership and changes

Boyd was appointed chief administrative officer of the system by Mackey when the state intervened in August 2024. Boyd hired Michael Turner on April 1 to be the school’s new superintendent, who was the principal of Pinson Valley High School in Jefferson County for ten years. He said in an interview on June 23 that he plans to stay at BCS after the state withdraws.
“Why would we not believe that our kids, our investment, would deserve as good an education as the students at Mountain Brook, Vestavia, or any other OTM (Over the Mountain) school or wherever?” he said. “They deserve the absolute best quality of education.”
Boyd said that in order to set BCS up for success after intervention, board members and administrators are going through as much training and professional development as possible. 
“We’re trying our very best to train everyone to be as competent as they can be,” he said. “We truly believe that professional development is going to be very, very important to help our school leaders, to help our teachers be successful in this district.”
Turner said there are three “big rocks” to move the district forward: school board/superintendent relationship, personnel and operational procedures.
“If we can fix those three things, this school district, there’s no question in my mind, can excel, we’ll go past being a C,” Turner said.
The changes will take time, Boyd said, but the progress is good at this point.
“Engineers build bridges and build buildings,” Boyd said. “We’re offering a person to come here and build a person’s future. There’s no more rewarding work than doing that.”

(Photo: Getty Images)America has never been richer. But the gains are so lopsided that the top 10% controls 69% of all wealth in the country, while the bottom half controls just 3%. Meanwhile, surging corporate profits have mostly benefited investors, not the broader public.
This divide is expected to widen after President Donald Trump’s sweeping new spending bill drastically cuts Medicaid and food aid, programs that stabilize the economy and subsidize low-wage employers.
Moreover, the tax cuts at the heart of the bill will deliver tens of billions of dollars in benefits to the wealthiest households while disproportionately burdening low-income households, according to analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation. By 2033, the bottom 20% will pay more in taxes while the top 0.1% receive $43 billion in cuts.
I am a sociologist who studies economic inequality, and my research demonstrates that the class-based inequalities exacerbated by the Trump bill are not new. Rather, they are part of a 50-year trend linked to social cleavages, political corruption and a declining belief in the common good.
 The roots of class-based inequality

The decades following World War II were broadly prosperous, but conditions began changing in the 1970s. Class inequality has increased enormously since then, according to government data, while income inequality has risen for five decades at the expense of workers.
Economists usually gauge a country’s economic health by looking at its gross domestic product as measured through total spending on everything from groceries to patents.
But another way to view GDP is by looking at whether the money goes to workers or business owners. This second method – the income approach – offers a clearer picture of who really benefits from economic growth.
The money that goes to labor’s share of GDP, or workers, is represented by employee compensation, including wages, salaries and benefits. The money left over for businesses after paying for work and materials is called gross operating surplus, or business surplus.
The share of GDP going to workers rose 12% from 1947 to 1970, then fell 14% between 1970 and 2023. The opposite happened with the business surplus, falling 18% in the early postwar decades before jumping 34% from 1970 to today.

Meanwhile, corporate profits have outpaced economic growth by 193% since 1970. Within profits, shareholder dividends as a share of GDP grew 274%.
As of 2023, labor had lost all of the economic gains made since 1947. Had workers kept their 1970 share of GDP, they would have earned $1.7 trillion more in 2023 alone. And no legislation or federal action since 1970 has reversed this half-century trend.
When more of the economy goes to businesses instead of workers, that poses serious social problems. My research focuses on three that threaten democracy.
 1. Fraying social bonds and livelihoods

Not just an issue of income and assets, growing class inequality represents the fraying of American society.
For instance, inequality and the resulting hardship are linked to worse health outcomes. Americans die younger than their peers in other rich countries, and U.S. life expectancy has decreased, especially among the poor.
Moreover, economic struggles contribute to mental health issues, deaths of despair and profound problems such as addiction, including tobacco, alcohol and opioid abuse.
Inequality can disrupt families. Kids who experience the stresses of poverty can develop neurological and emotional problems, putting them at risk for drug use as adults. On the other hand, when minimum wages increase and people begin saving wealth, divorce risk falls.
Research shows inequality has many other negative consequences, from reduced social mobility to lower social trust and even higher homicide rates.
Together, these broad social consequences are linked to misery, political discontent and normlessness.
 2. Increasing corruption in politics

Inequality is rising in the U.S. largely because business elites are exercising more influence over policy outcomes, research shows. My related work on privatization explains how 50 years of outsourcing public functions – through contracting, disinvestment and job cuts – threatens democratic accountability.
Research across different countries has repeatedly found that higher income inequality increases political corruption. It does so by undermining trust in government and institutions, and enabling elites to dominate policymaking while weakening public oversight.
Since 2010, weakened campaign finance laws driven by monied interests have sharply increased corruption risks. The Supreme Court ruled then in Citizens United to lift campaign finance restrictions, enabling unlimited political spending. It reached an apex in 2024, when Elon Musk spent $200 million to elect Trump before later installing his Starlink equipment onto Federal Aviation Administration systems in a reported takeover of a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon.
Research shows that a large majority of Americans believe that the economy is rigged, suggesting everyday people sense the link between inequality and corruption.
 3. Undermining belief in the common good

National aspirations have emphasized the common good since America’s founding. The Declaration of Independence lists the king’s first offense as undermining the “public good” by subverting the rule of law. The Constitution’s preamble commits the government to promoting the general welfare and shared well-being.
But higher inequality historically means the common good goes overlooked, according to research. Meanwhile, work has become more precarious, less unionized, more segmented and less geographically stable. Artificial intelligence may worsen these trends.
This tends to coincide with a drop in voting and other forms of civic engagement.
The government has fewer mechanisms for protecting community when rising inequality is paired with lower taxes for the wealthy and reduced public resources. My research finds that public sector unions especially bolster civic engagement in this environment.
Given increasing workplace and social isolation, America’s loneliness epidemic is unsurprising, especially for low earners.
All of these factors and their contribution to alienation can foster authoritarian beliefs and individualism. When people become cold and distrustful of one another, the notion of the common good collapses.
 Inequality as a policy outcome

News coverage of the Trump bill and policy debate have largely centered on immediate gains and losses. But zoomed out, a clearer picture emerges of the long-term dismantling of foundations that once supported broad economic security. That, in turn, has enabled democratic decline.
As labor’s share of the economy declined, so too did the institutional trust and shared social values that underpin democratic life. Among the many consequences are the political discontent and disillusionment shaping our current moment.
Republicans hold both chambers of Congress through 2026, making significant policy changes unlikely in the short term. Democrats opposed the bill but are out of power. And their coalition is divided between a centrist establishment and an insurgent progressive wing with diverging priorities in addressing inequality.
Yet democratic decline and inequality are not inevitable. If restoring broad prosperity and social stability are the goals, they may require revisiting the New Deal-style policies that produced labor’s peak economic share of 59% of GDP in 1970.

(Courtesy photo ALTSD)
With additional state funds and reorganization of several programs, older New Mexicans, people with disabilities and caregivers now have support through the Aging and Long-Term Services Department’s reactivated Long-Term Care Division.
The Long-Term Care Division has long been part of the state’s aging department, but the division went dormant in Fiscal Year 2012 after community-based Medicaid waiver programs were moved from the division to the New Mexico Department of Health. Programs such as disability assistance and long-term living arrangements moved again last year to the Health Care Authority.
The aging department asked for additional state funds to renew the Long-Term Care Division during the most recent legislative session, and received just under $7 million through House Bill 2 to staff and operate the division. Joey Long, spokesperson for the ALTSD, told Source NM that $500,000 of the total appropriation was directed specifically to the Long-Term Care Division, while the rest was appropriated from existing department funding. Long said the reestablishment of the division is expected to “streamline care coordination,” particularly around community-based services.
“The [Long-Term Care Division] is going to be coordinating the care that helps us support people staying in their homes in their communities of choice. The division will be primarily focused on community and caregiver support resources, education and training,” Long told Source in an email.
According to a recent ALTSD news release, the division will now provide “coordinated and comprehensive” support to New Mexicans by overseeing programs including New MexiCare, the Veteran-Directed Care Program, the Office of Alzheimer’s and Dementia, Care Transitions and the Kinship Caregiver Pilot Program. 
New MexiCare provides financial assistance and caregiver training to qualifying New Mexicans throughout the state, except Bernalillo and Doña Ana counties — however, the department has previously told Source NM that the goal is to expand the program to encompass all counties. The Care Transition Program provides assistance and resources for people transitioning out of a long-term care facility and back into their own homes or other community setting. 
“The inclusion of this division marks a pivotal moment in how we deliver care to New Mexicans,” Aging and Long-Term Services Department Secretary Emily Kaltenbach said in a written statement. “By housing these vital programs under one focused division, we are ensuring that families, caregivers, and individuals living with complex needs have streamlined access to high-quality, person-centered care.”
According to the department’s news release, the Long-Term Care Division will also work to expand training opportunities and support for caregivers, enhance community-based services across the state, improve access to services in rural and tribal areas and oversee construction of “dementia-capable infrastructure.” 
According to Long, ALTSD Deputy Secretary Angelina Flores-Montoya will directly oversee the division.
“This is about building out a care system where no one falls through the cracks,” Flores-Montoya said in a written statement. “With the launch of this division, we’re not just reorganizing; we are deepening our commitment to serving the full continuum of long-term care needs in New Mexico.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lavendr_NMAS-Photo-Library-2025_0089-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

State Attorney General Dana Nessel is investigating the state’s quasi-public economic development agency in a larger probe of a $20 million state grant, administered by the MEDC, to a Southeast Michigan businesswoman who is a prominent figure in Democratic circles.
Senate Republican leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) is calling for a federal investigation of the matter. Nesbitt is running for governor in next year’s election.
Fay Beydoun obtained the grant in 2022 to fund her newly created nonprofit company, Global Link International, formed (after the grant was awarded) to attract international business investment to Michigan. The Detroit News was first to report that Beydoun spent a portion of the money on a $4,500 coffeemaker, an $11,000 first-class plane ticket to Budapest and her annual salary of a whopping $550,000.
The grant was a budget appropriation approved by the then-Republican-controlled Legislature and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The MEDC, which oversaw the grant, cancelled it in March after the extravagant spending became public.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Investigators from Nessel’s office raided Beydoun’s Farmington Hills home and the MEDC’s offices on June 18. Nessel’s office complained the MEDC had been stonewalling its investigation, an allegation the MEDC denied. Beydoun has not been charged with a crime.
Although the MEDC did not fund the grant from one of its myriad business assistance programs—it was a direct legislative appropriation— the agency was charged with ensuring the $20 million in taxpayer funds was properly spent.
Nessel is seeking to learn more about how involved the MEDC was in pushing the legislative grant for Beydoun, Michigan Advance reported.
Beydoun was a member of the policy-setting MEDC executive committee at the time the grant was awarded. One email sent to the governor’s office by Beydoun said the MEDC approved of the payout to her company, Michigan Advance said.
The MEDC was created by then-Gov. John Engler in 1999 as a public-private partnership and at the time was considered a model for state economic development agencies. Putting the MEDC outside of direct state government control was designed to ensure continuity in economic development strategy regardless of which political party was in charge.
Its CEO doesn’t report directly to the governor like other state department heads, but to an 18-member executive committee. That’s led to less accountability to taxpayers and a long history of contentious relations with lawmakers, the media and other organizations seeking information about its workings.
The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, an often-influential free market proponent, has repeatedly called for the MEDC to be abolished.
Nevertheless, the agency has historically enjoyed strong bipartisan support for the billions of dollars it has spent to keep businesses from leaving the state and to attract new ones.
That was no more true than nearly four ago when lawmakers and Whitmer, caught flat-footed over Ford Motor Co.’s record $11.4 billion investment in electric vehicle and battery production in Tennessee and Kentucky, hastily created a $500 million pot to attract similar factories.
The Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund has since committed more than $1 billion to automakers and other clean-energy companies, according to the MEDC’s 2024 annual report.
But not a single job has yet been created from those awards.
That’s mostly due to project delays and pullbacks resulting from electric vehicle sales falling well below earlier projections.
Ford Motor Co. has scaled back job projections at its under-construction EV battery plant in Marshall from 2,350 jobs to 1,700 positions. The plant is expected to start production next year.
General Motors Co. has abandoned plans to convert its Orion Township assembly plant in Oakland County to build electric pickups and instead will build gas-powered trucks there.
GM earlier this year also completed the sale of its stake in a $1.5 billion Lansing battery plant nearing completion to its South Korean joint-venture partner, LG Energy Solution. A $120 million Critical Industry Program grant, part of the SOAR Fund, has been transferred to LG.
The move angered state House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), who called it “a troubling pattern (by GM) of fleecing taxpayers and workers.”
Hall also has more broadly criticized the state’s business attraction incentives. He recently claimed the incentives are “not getting the results” and much of the money should be redirected to fixing the roads.
The MEDC’s Michigan Business Development Program, which was created in 2011 during the administration of then-Gov. Rick Snyder, has since its inception announced $290 million in grants and loans to businesses investing and creating jobs in the state.
Only about half of that has been dispersed because of the lack of job creation induced by the incentives.
Businesses committed to creating 28,811 jobs in exchange for the state’s financial support, but have added just 9,918 positions, according to the MEDC’s 2024 annual report. That’s only 2% of the 531,000 payroll jobs added in the state since 2011.
Democrats also have called for overhauling state business and talent attraction efforts.
In 2023, a coalition led by state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (R-Royal Oak) introduced a package of bills that would have shifted half of SOAR funding to community-based programs, including affordable housing, public transit and other investments. The bills failed to pass before the end of the legislation session last year.
But Nessel’s investigation into the MEDC’s role in the Beydoun grant scandal could finally force needed reforms at the agency to improve its effectiveness and its accountability to taxpayers.
It’s becoming more and more apparent that an economic development strategy focused on handing out cash to businesses to create jobs is woefully inadequate.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8781-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

(File photo/Getty Images)Students attending South Carolina’s only historically Black technical college can learn to weld but on equipment that’s 70 years old. The school has talked of growing its cybersecurity degree program, but the computer systems it has for students to train on are far from the latest model.
Just how old they are is unknown — at least, to legislators who toured the school.
Yet when Denmark Technical College sought money to put toward a proposed new $35 million cybersecurity, energy and healthcare building, Senate budget writers refused to fund any of it. The House provided $2.3 million for the project in its state budget proposal. But the final version of the budget that took effect July 1 gave zero.
“If the state won’t fund it, how are you going to grow the program,” Rep. Justin Bamberg, D-Bamberg, told the SC Daily Gazette. “No one is going to pay money to go to a tech school that has old technology. In today’s day and age, nobody wants to go to a run-down college.”
New tech school investments to address increased enrollment, AI skills in manufacturing

It’s the second year in a row that the small tech school, located in sparsely populated Bamberg County along South Carolina’s rural southwestern border, has had its requests yanked from the budget as it battles ongoing financial problems.
Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto called it “a shot across the bow” from some Senate GOP leaders that Denmark Tech administrators need to balance the struggling school’s budget and boost enrollment.
The college developed a budget stabilization plan, as requested by the Legislature, but it wasn’t considered practical, Hutto said. “That was one of the frustrations,” he said.
The Orangeburg Democrat, along with others who represent or advocate for the state’s historically Black colleges and universities, acknowledge the college’s past leadership issues and failure to get in front of financial shortfalls. However, they question how their fellow legislators can expect the school to meet their goals if the funds for big-dollar projects needed to enter the 21st century are continuously denied.
In turn, the only option the school is left with are deeper cuts and nothing to attract the greater number of students it would need to raise revenues.
“That’s an abomination,” said Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, who sits on the House higher education budget panel.
“I don’t recall us doing that to other tech schools,” the Orangeburg Democrat added.
The school has not had a new technical building since 1961, and it hasn’t had a new academic building since 1975. Meanwhile legislators funneled $140 million for projects and maintenance at 14 of South Carolina’s other technical colleges in the current budget. Two rural schools — Denmark Tech and Northeastern Tech based in Cheraw — were left out.
Denmark Tech administrators did not grant multiple requests over several weeks from the SC Daily Gazette for an interview.

Financial turmoil
Denmark Tech’s troubles at the top began in 2009, when then-President John Waddell was suspended without pay after an audit found some unnamed “administrative irregularities,” The Associated Press reported.
The college then went through a series of interim and short-term leadership, with none remaining in charge for more than three years. In 2017, the Legislature voted unanimously to temporarily put the state Technical College System in control of the school in dire financial straits.
The student body had fallen from about 2,000 full- and part-time students in fall 2012 to just 600 students four years later ahead of the tech system taking over, according to data from the state’s higher education agency. All tech school enrollment was on the decline at this time, though none as precipitous as Denmark Tech. And while numbers plummeted, little was done to cut expenses or workforce to match needs.
Over that same four-year period, the school’s cash on hand sank to about $285,000 from just over $9 million, The Associated Press reported.
In 2019, House budget writers recommended converting Denmark Tech to a trade school, offering industry certificates for flight training and skilled jobs in construction. Proponents saw the mission change as a way to keep the doors open. But advocates of the school protested, and legislators scrapped the idea.
Later that year, the tech college system found itself shuffling around $2 million from the pool of money it doles out to its 16 schools, taking a portion from the others to make up for Denmark Tech’s shortfall. System leaders discovered further issues, including misspending of $500,000 the state budget provided the school in 2018 to buy equipment that it instead used to cover payroll.
When Denmark Tech’s most recent president, Willie Todd Jr., stepped to the helm in January 2020, legislators tasked him to come up with a plan to turn around the cash-strapped school as they debated its future.
Three months later, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, sending colleges nationwide into a financial tailspin.
‘Begging for crumbs’
Cobb-Hunter was among legislators pushing for the conversion of Denmark Tech to a trade school. But she said her viewpoint has since evolved, largely thanks to Todd’s leadership.
“I think they proved themselves,” Cobb-Hunter said. “But leadership without resources can only do so much. It’s hard to grow when you’re constantly begging for crumbs.”
Todd’s last day at the school was June 30 as he left to become president of Talladega College in Alabama.
Today, enrollment hovers around 700 students and Denmark Tech employs about 50 people. In the college’s latest financial report, expenses outpaced revenue by $1 million. All of this falls against a backdrop of declining college enrollment nationwide and a so-called “enrollment cliff” after decades of declining birthrates mean a smaller pool of potential students.
SC governor calls for study to consider consolidating colleges ahead of ‘enrollment cliff’

Last year, legislators agreed to let the school use $2.2 million in maintenance funds for operations but denied it $2.4 million in the budget for renovating a pair of buildings on campus. The shift in funds also came with the stipulation that the college develop a budget stabilization plan and a reduction of employees.
Legislators representing the college say looking at the numbers on the balance sheet doesn’t tell the whole story about the technical college that’s been chronically underfunded almost since its beginning.
Historic factors
A 1947 state law created Denmark Tech as a trade school for Black South Carolinians, and it opened a year later. The school became part of the statewide technical college system in 1969, eight years after that system’s creation, as the school for students in Allendale, Bamberg and Barnwell counties.
But according to Hutto, as the state was still struggling against national desegregation mandates, Denmark Tech was not provided funding from the state at the same level other tech schools in the system were.
“It’s easy for people to say today you should be doing great now,” Bamberg said of the racial history surrounding the college. “But it doesn’t change the reality that, for so long, some people were purposefully screwed by and left out of the system. People seem to forget that, for some people, the starting line was 100 miles behind everyone else.”
Furthermore, Denmark Tech covers South Carolina’s three smallest counties, with high schools educating only about 400 seniors total, according to state education department data. Many of these students come from poor families, putting them more at risk and requiring extra aid to graduate.
And there is little industry in the tri-county region where students can get a job after graduating. The lack of an industrial tax base has put the cost of K-12 school construction on residents through high property taxes.
All these factors compound to impact Denmark Tech and the region’s residents, Bamberg said.
Finally, technical colleges are designed to educate students closer to home. If the school were to close, students from area high schools would have to travel farther than their peers for a technical education.
Many already do. They drive to Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College, about 30 miles from the Denmark campus, or to Aiken Technical College, which is also about 30 miles from parts of Barnwell County. Other alternatives include the University of South Carolina satellite campus in Allendale.
Advocates argue more students would enroll at Denmark Tech if the facilities were up to date.
“Legislators can’t just keep saying, ‘Oh, poor Denmark Tech’ and not own up to our responsibility in how we got here,” Cobb-Hunter said.
“I hear the governor and everyone talk about South Carolina being in the best financial condition it’s ever been,” Bamberg added. “But we have a state technical college that has old buildings that were around when peoples’ grandparents attended. It’s so frustrating.”
It remains to be seen whether prior recommendations will resurface. Back in 2019, the state technical system suggested turning Denmark Tech into a satellite campus of Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College.
Sen. Ronnie Cromer, who chairs the Senate’s higher education budget panel, said both the technical college and South Carolina State University in Orangeburg — the state’s only public historically Black university — are in need of upgrades of their own. They’re where many of the region’s students are choosing to attend already, and they’re outperforming Denmark Tech, he said.
“It siphons off money that can be put to good use,” the Newberry County Republican said of bolstering Denmark Tech. “Those that have proven themselves and are educating our children to the best of their ability, they are the ones that really deserve to be funded properly.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/graduates-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 09:09:35.732387

The Democratic National Convention adopted a platform that called for a federal anti-lynching law, the abolition of poll taxes and the desegregation of armed forces. The vote came to the floor as a minority report of the Platform Committee, the spokesman for it being then-Minneapolis Mayor Hubert Humphrey. 
The entire Mississippi delegation stormed out of the convention, and so did many other Southern Democrats, including a young Alabama representative named George Wallace. Three days later, the “Dixiecrats,” who wanted to preserve Jim Crow laws and white supremacy, held their own convention and nominated South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond for president and Mississippi Gov. Fielding Wright for vice president. 
In the November election, the pair received more than 1.1 million popular votes and 39 electoral votes from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee. Despite the split in the Democratic Party, President Harry Truman won the upset victory. 
Although the party welcomed the Dixiecrats back to the fold after the election, this rebellion signaled the fissures that would come in the 1960s, with many Southern Democrats switching to the Republican Party.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06102304/July14-Dixiecrats-poster-1948.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

Alabama doesn’t do well on either.
Start with security. At the most basic level, a prison needs doors that lock. This was a problem in at least one state correctional facility in recent memory. But security also means that staff and inmates don’t have to live under a constant threat of physical harm.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That’s not the case in our prisons. The Alabama Department of Corrections last fall reported a 13% increase in fights in its facilities as well as an increase in inmate-on-staff assaults. DOC has also shelled out millions of dollars to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force by corrections officers on inmates. And all of this comes amid a years-long federal lawsuit over physical and sexual assaults in Alabama prisons.
Knowing all this, hope seems trivial, even something to scoff at. Most politicians think public safety is sidearms and snappy uniforms, not allowing people to see a better future. But if the incarcerated don’t have something to live for or work toward during their time in prison, violence becomes a lot more tempting and rehabilitation programs become far less appealing.
“What reason do they have to go (to rehab programs) as long as they’ll be denied for parole?” Kenneth Traywick, an inmate in the state prison system, told my colleague Melissa Brown in 2021. “They know this. Nobody is wanting to do any of that because they know good and well it’s not going to help them in the long run.”
As chair of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, Leigh Gwathney did all she could to destroy hope among the state’s incarcerated population.
During Gwathney’s time on the board, which ended last week, the parole grant rate, which stood at 54% in 2017, plummeted to 8% in 2023. It’s rebounded in recent years, but in many cases, the board ignored parole guidelines when they said applicants should be released from prison.
This was done in the name of law and order, or at least a 1987 version of it. Gov. Kay Ivey, who got new powers over the state pardons and paroles process in 2018, first paired Gwathney with Charlie Graddick, a former Alabama attorney general and judge who embodied a Reagan-era approach to law enforcement. Ivey said in a statement at the time of Gwathney’s appointment that she expected them to “ultimately, improve public safety across the state.”
Six years later, it’s hard to see any effect that approach had on public safety. By most measures, Alabama’s crime rates in 2019 were up from historic lows in the middle part of the decade but not even close to records set in the early 1990s. A pandemic-era surge in crime the next year — coming as the board was squeezing parole rates — was sharp but short.  Crime rates were effectively flat in the state in 2022 and 2023, according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. Birmingham and Montgomery, hit hard by gun violence, have seen homicide levels drop this year.
But Alabama prisons never stopped being violent or dangerous in those six years. And the board kept many people locked in there, even those who had worked in good faith to reform and cut time off their sentences.
The parole board didn’t create the crisis in the state’s correctional facilities. But they embodied state officials’ effective indifference to it. By telling inmates they could never take steps to shorten a sentence, they took away incentives for order behind bars. For keeping prisons safe.
And for a while, most of the people responsible shrugged.
But not all. Even before parole rates hit their all-time low, Graddick faced sharp questions from Democratic and Republican legislators about the declining parole rates. He stepped down from the job at the end of 2020.
Gwathney held on. The end only came after a disastrous appearance before lawmakers last October, where she struggled to answer questions about the board’s parole rates and its responsiveness to legislators’ inquiries. (A tip for all state officials: Do not make the people who set your budget wait months for their requests.)
Can things get better? We’ll see. Graddick’s old job has been held for years by Cam Ward, who spent much of his time in the Legislature trying to fix the prison crisis and has worked to provide rehabilitation and training services to those in his purview.
Hal Nash, Ivey’s pick to succeed Gwathney, is also talking about putting public safety first. But he also acknowledged that people can change for the better, an idea that seemed foreign to Gwathney and many of her colleagues on the board.
I hope Nash understands that “public safety” and “inmate rehabilitation” are not ideas in conflict with each other. They are tied together. And keeping the hope out of prisons will mean extending the violence and a lot less security for all of us.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_002-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

He told the board that the impact of President Donald Trump's reconciliation bill was not as large on community colleges as expected, but to still move forward with caution. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The chancellor of the Alabama Community College System said Wednesday he is more optimistic about the impact of President Donald Trump’s reconciliation bill after changes were made to the legislation during the process. 
“I think the update is a much better dose compared to what we thought it might be in the beginning,” Chancellor Jimmy Baker said at the board’s meeting Wednesday.
At the June board meeting, Baker expressed concerns about the implications of the reconciliation bill, especially in regards to federal Pell Grants and the eligibility requirements for it. 
The Pell Grant is given to students based on their expected family contribution, among other academic factors, and often goes to students with “exceptional financial need,” according to the Federal Student Aid Office. According to ACCS, its students receive an average of $4,300 in Pell Grants every year, about $500 less than the median ACCS yearly tuition.
The first version of the bill included changing the definition of a full time student to be a student enrolled in 15 credit hours, up from 12 credit hours. The final version did not include that change. 
“That certainly would have had major implications on our students,” said Boone Kinard, the executive director of external affairs for ACCS. “Again, those were not included in the final version of the bill, and we are very happy that they were not.”
The changes on federal student aid that did make the final version of the bill will not impact community colleges, Kinard said. However, he said there are some additional accountability measures for community college students that do receive federal aid.
“Now the earnings of students who have gone through programs will be tracked on the federal level and will be looked at a lot more closely moving forward than they have been in the past,” he said. “Certainly, we want to see what the guidelines are on that.”
Although Kinard said community colleges were not impacted as much as expected by the bill, there may still be threats to federal funding for the next fiscal year. 
“President Trump has proposed some cuts, and that will be through the congressional appropriations process, which is a completely different process from what they’ve just done,” he said. “There’s a lot of unknown at this point of how all that’s going to play out.”
Moving forward, Kinard told the board members that they should be prepared for federal funding cuts and expect money to be used differently.
“Our expectation is not as bad as it looked like six weeks ago or four weeks ago, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be cautious,” Baker said. “I do think the odds of continuing funding at the current level down the road is not going to be a good chance.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9642-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/07/14/maryland-churches-could-openly-endorse-candidates-from-the-pulpit-under-irs-proposal/,"A recent court filing by the IRS could allow churches and other houses of worship to endorse political candidates from the pulpit without endangering their nonprofit status, a reversal from decades of policy.","Churches could make political endorsements without fear of losing their nonprofit status, if a recent IRS settlement agreement is approved by a federal judge in Texas in a lawsuit brought by churches. (Photo by Capt. Joe Bush/U.S. Army)The Rev. L.K. Floyd believes church leaders should have the liberty to speak to their congregations and support certain political candidates, especially when it comes to improving their communities.
Floyd, pastor at Heart Changers Baptist Church in Silver Spring, said Friday some people may believe that allowing that only helps evangelical Christians, pointing to white evangelicals like the late Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr. who established the Moral Majority in 1979 as a political organization pushing a “pro-family” agenda.
“Not allowing the Black church, in particular, to be able to speak from the pulpit their political views, and also to be able to endorse their candidates and focus and support their agendas, I believe would be dangerous and problematic,” Floyd said. “When there is something that is unjust … we must speak truth to power.”
Now, the Internal Revenue Service agrees.
In a proposed settlement filed last week, the IRS agreed with the National Religious Broadcasters that churches and other houses of worship should be allowed to formally endorse political candidate without endangering their nonprofit status under the tax code.
A U.S. District Court judge in Texas still has to approve the agreement, which would settle a lawsuit by two Texas churches, the Intercessors for America and the National Religious Broadcasters that challenged the “Johnson Amendment” to the Internal Revenue Code. That 1954 amendment was introduced by then-Texas Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, and said that nonprofit organizations can maintain tax exempt status if they refrain from political campaigning.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
There’s no specific deadline for the judge to make a decision. A lawyer with the IRS didn’t respond to an email for comment. A lawyer for the plaintiffs declined to comment Thursday.
The seven-page court filing states the amendment violates the plaintiffs’ First and Fifth Amendment rights to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion, as well as their rights to equal protection under the law. It said merely speaking from the pulpit does not violate the Johnson Amendment rule against participating in or intervening in a political campaign.
“Bona fide communications internal to a house of worship, between the house of worship and its congregation, in connection with religious services, do neither of those things, any more than does a family discussion concerning candidates,” the proposed settlement says.
“Thus, communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted,” it says.
The settlement also acknowledged the IRS “has not enforced the Johnson Amendment against houses of worship for speech concerning electoral politics in the context of worship services.”
‘A green light’
University of Notre Dame law Professor Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer said in an interview Thursday that the IRS hasn’t been enforcing the so-called Johnson amendment for at least the past 20 years.
“Many religious leaders have become bolder and bolder in inviting candidates to come speak at their church, calling them up to get praised, or saying other things that clearly indicate support of a candidate and not have the IRS open up an audit or threaten their types of status as a result,” said Hitoshi Mayer, whose areas of research include election and tax law and political activity by churches and other religious organizations.
“It gives churches that perhaps were hesitant to engage in this activity because they were worried about the IRS a green light to do so,” he said.
Even if the judge decides not to approve the settlement, and asks both parties to go back and try again, Hitoshi Mayer said the IRS acknowledges “we are not going to enforce the Johnson amendment” against churches and other houses of worship. At least it wouldn’t happen during the Trump administration, he said, because President Donald Trump (R) said during his first term in office he wanted to repeal the amendment.

On Wednesday during a lunch with African leaders, Trump said, “I love the fact that churches can endorse a political candidate. If somebody of faith wants to endorse, I think it’s something that I’d like to hear. Those people were not allowed to speak up. Now they’re allowed to speak up. I think it’s terrific.”
Separation of church and state, or not
Jeff Trimbath, president of the nonprofit Maryland Family Institute, called the IRS court filing “a watershed moment.”
“For too long, many pastors have operated under the chilling belief that the law prevented them from equipping their congregations on how to think biblically about civic engagement, candidates, and public policy,” Trimbath said in a statement Tuesday. “The IRS made it clear: there is no such prohibition. Let’s pray this leads to pulpits that are once again unafraid to preach the whole counsel of God — including His truth for the public square.”
Not all religious groups are on board. Ashley Hildebrand, senior adviser with Catholics for Choice based in Washington, D.C., hopes the judge rejects the settlement, especially given what it could mean for the separation of church and state.
“If the church can endorse a political candidate, it is just one more way that priests could preach from the pulpit and further alienate people in the pews,” Hildebrand said Thursday.
“If we allow the pulpit to be weaponized or put into service of a political agenda more so than it already is, we are essentially allowing a very well-organized religious force to mobilize its base in pursuit of a partisan agenda,” she said. “That is inherently dangerous.”
No matter what the judge decides, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said it plans to maintain its stance of not endorsing or opposing political candidates.
“The IRS was addressing a specific case, and it doesn’t change how the Catholic Church engages in public debate,” the conference’s spokesperson Chieko Noguchi said in a statement Tuesday. “The Church seeks to help Catholics form their conscience in the Gospel so they might discern which candidates and policies would advance the common good.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2632341-cropped-e1752492036207-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-14 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What are the new AI laws in Connecticut?,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/14/ct-ai-laws-session/,"CT didn't regulate AI for businesses, but it did criminalize deepfake revenge porn and provide education funding for artificial intelligence.","For the second year in a row, Connecticut legislators decided not to regulate AI for businesses, but they did pass a law that criminalizes deepfake revenge porn and provides education funding for artificial intelligence. 
A bill that would have required companies to publicly disclose their AI use was passed by the Senate but was not taken up by the House after Gov. Ned Lamont threatened to veto the measure. He expressed concern that it would damage Connecticut’s technology sector. 
Here’s what to know about this session’s AI bills, their status and how they compare to other states’ laws.
What AI bills became law this year?
Most of the AI legislation signed into law this session came in the budget bill, which authorized $500,000 for the Connecticut Online AI academy, $25,000 for AI training at the Boys and Girls Club of Milford and $75,000 for three Boys and Girls Clubs’ AI training pilots in the state. 
It also made disseminating “synthetically created” revenge porn a crime as of Oct. 1, 2025. The law does not directly mention AI-created images, but lawmakers are aiming to address the problem of generative-AI revenge porn deepfakes. The law could also apply to other image creation techniques. It criminalizes the sharing of such images without the depicted person’s consent.
And new privacy legislation in Senate Bill 1295 requires collectors of sensitive data to notify consumers if their personal data is being used to train large language models.
It also gives consumers the right to opt out of automated systems, which could include AI, to prevent them from using their personal data to make significant decisions regarding housing, insurance, health care, education, criminal justice and employment. It gives consumers the right to question decisions made with automated decision systems, and if it relates to housing, to correct any inaccurate information before the decision is reevaluated. 
What didn’t pass? 
Senate Bill 2, a measure that would have required companies to publicly disclose AI use to consumers, passed the Senate but was not brought up for a vote in the House by the end of the session. Last-minute amendments watered down initial requirements to produce annual impact assessments and mitigate algorithmic discrimination in an attempt to make the bill more palatable to the governor.
This is the second year such AI business regulation has made it through the Senate, and just like last year, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, declined to call it to the House floor after Lamont threatened to veto it.
Another piece of legislation, Senate Bill 1484, which sought to prevent algorithmic discrimination against employees and require disclosure of AI’s role in employee assessment, was passed by the Judiciary Committee but went no further in the legislative process. 
Why did Lamont threaten to veto S.B. 2? 
This is the third year Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, has authored a bill on AI. The first one, which required the disclosure of AI use by the Connecticut government, sailed through the Senate and House before being signed into law in 2023 by Lamont. 
While Maroney got key senate leaders, Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney,  D-New Haven, and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, on board for S.B. 2, though, he failed to convince Lamont. 
The governor has dissuaded legislators from passing AI regulation that he thinks could risk scaring business away from Connecticut. 
“The governor remains concerned that this is a fast-moving space and that we need to make sure we do this right and don’t stymie innovation,” Lamont’s office said in 2024 about a similar bill.
This year, Lamont’s chief innovation officer Dan O’Keefe said S.B. 2 would send “a message that says, ‘Because we don’t understand this yet, you can’t innovate here. You can’t take risks here.’”
O’Keefe also expressed concern that passing such legislation in Connecticut was “too early” and that a state with 1% of the U.S. population should not be among the first few in the country to pass AI regulation. 
Sens. John Kissel, R-Enfield, Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven, and Melissa Osborne, D-Simsbury, who spoke in opposition to the bill when it came up for its vote in the Judiciary Committee, echoed O’Keefe’s concerns. Kissel also brought up the Trump administration’s support for AI technology as a reason to not pass a regulatory bill now. 
What are AI laws in other states? 
Several states have passed AI legislation in the last couple of years. Colorado became the first state to require that companies disclose their artificial intelligence systems and to codify discrimination by AI of protected groups as illegal in 2024, similar to the goals of Connecticut’s S.B. 2. 
Utah passed legislation in 2024 that requires proactive disclosure of AI use in regulated occupations. California and Texas have also passed private-sector regulatory laws.  
Connecticut joins New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and others in criminalizing deepfake revenge porn. New Hampshire law even goes a step further to prohibit deepfakes of any kind that cause reputational harm, including deepfakes of political candidates. 
States have had various aspects of AI legislation introduced, but it has failed to pass at different points in the system. A law with goals similar to Connecticut’s S.B. 2 passed in Virginia but was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
What about federal AI law? 
Trump signed the Take It Down Act in May, which criminalizes deepfake porn federally.
The federal budget reconciliation bill, also known as the ‘big beautiful bill’ that passed earlier this month, initially contained a Trump-backed ban on states enforcing and enacting any AI laws for 10 years. Hours before the bill passed, senators voted 99-1 to remove the ban language from the bill. 
It remains up to the states to chart their own course.   
How did CT Mirror use AI this session? 
CT Mirror used AI to analyze the text of bills, create transcriptions of hearings and sessions when a transcript was not readily available and search for relevant quotes within bill and transcript text. We used AI to search for explicit language in a 9-hour video, enabling us to publish our piece within the course of an afternoon. CT Mirror checked quotes against original documents and confirmed claims with secondary sources.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nicole Miller: The freeze of federal funding for after-school programs and its impact in Vermont.","This commentary is by Nicole Miller of Burlington. She is executive director of Vermont Afterschool, a statewide nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that children and youth in every Vermont community are able to benefit from the power of after-school.


Recent news of the Trump administration withholding $6.8 billion in FY25 federal education funding, including $1.4 billion intended for before- and after-school programs through Title IV Part B, the “21st Century Community Learning Centers” program, is unacceptable.
Communities across Vermont know that after-school and summer programs are providing invaluable learning opportunities for young people — keeping them safe, inspiring them to learn and grow, and giving working families peace of mind. It raises concerns about the potential ripple effects on student learning, family stability and community engagement.
Congress appropriated, and all 50 states and D.C. have already committed these funds to individual after-school and summer learning programs, most of which are expecting their grants now. By holding back these funds, the administration is disregarding the needs of students and families at a crucial time of the year, the ramifications of which will be felt for years to come.
In Vermont, the impact of not receiving these funds will be felt deeply. Ninety-four individual after-school and summer program locations throughout the state, serving 11,000 youth, are currently supported by the 21st CCLC funding.
After-school programs play a vital role in the learning ecosystem for millions of children across the United States. According to the “America After 3PM” report from the Afterschool Alliance, 24.7 million children would participate in an after-school program if one were available to them. This demand far outpaces supply, leaving nearly one-in-two families struggling to access opportunities that support academic achievement, social development, and family economic stability.
In Vermont, more than 26,000 children and youth would be enrolled in a program if one were available, and nationally, 91% of registered voters overall agree that after-school programs provide parents with peace of mind. 
Nationally, registered voters report overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward these programs:
●     89% say after-school helps children learn life skills.
●     89% say it prevents risky behaviors and exposure to negative influences in-person and online
●     90% say it helps children catch up academically and socially.
After-school programs often go beyond academics. Many offer meals, physical activity, mentoring, STEM exploration and safe environments during peak hours for juvenile crime and risky behavior. In fact, juvenile crime peaks between 3 and 6 p.m. — the same hours after-school programs operate.
Access to these programs is uneven, especially in rural areas, tribal communities, and among low-income families. The “America After 3PM” report notes that children from low-income households are more likely to attend a program where staff help with homework, provide healthy snacks, and offer enrichment activities — but are also more likely to lose access when funding is unstable.
While this funding pause may be temporary, the implications are significant. It introduces uncertainty for schools and community organizations that plan and staff these programs months in advance. More importantly, it adds to the structural challenges that have long affected availability and affordability of quality after-school options.
As the conversation around federal education budgets continues, it is important to understand the role of after-school programs in supporting the whole child and the whole community. These programs represent more than enrichment — they represent opportunity, safety and connection for millions of families nationwide.

She is the author of three books that explore global challenges through the lens of nature, including “Cows Save the Planet: and Other Improbable Ways of Restoring Soil to Heal the Earth.”


One day I walked down the hill and glanced at the trees — the stately canopy at our property’s edge. Then I took a closer look: what I thought were crowns of maple, oak and shagbark hickory was in fact a shroud of vines, likely the Asiatic bittersweet that’s been shimmying up every trunk and limb in sight. 
Our land in southwestern Vermont is far from unique in being overrun by vines masquerading as treetops. Consider kudzu, known as “the vine that ate the South.”
And now, throughout New England, you’ll see trees bent and weakened by the advancing vegetation, now little more than scaffolding for leafy vines. In western Massachusetts, the Kennedy and Burbank parks contend with the “kiwi apocalypse,” as hardy kiwi — originally introduced by garden clubs and favored by Gilded Era elite — smothers native trees, while Sudbury’s Asiatic bittersweet problem is such that groups have instituted “bittersweet removal days.” An out-of-control invasive vine scenario is often referred to as an “infestation.” 
Troublesome vines like Asiatic bittersweet, kiwi, porcelain-berry, wisteria and, yes, kudzu, are generally dispersed by wildlife that eat the fruit. They are persistent: emerging from seeds, sprouting from roots, sending shoots or runners from cut stems. With fast-growing vines draped across our woodlands, our beloved broadleafs have to struggle for air and sunlight. 
When it comes to unwanted plants, my go-to is Mike Bald, whose Royalton company “Got Weeds?” manages invasives without chemicals. Mike does have a grudging respect for vines, and recognizes they do play an ecological role — at least when systems are in balance.
“Vines are nature’s rehab species,” he says. “They cover bare ground, stabilize temperatures, and allow recovery from disturbance to begin.” The invasion of invasive vines, then, can be seen in part as a symptom of the damage our forests, meadows and riparian areas have sustained. 
He also attributes this shift toward vines to conditions that increasingly favor climbers and creepers. He notes a study from 2006 that found poison ivy — a vine that’s native, if not beloved — grows more rigorously amid warmer temperatures and increased CO2.
While many trees suffer under weather extremes, he says vines seem unbothered by drought or wet conditions. One reason hardy kiwi flourishes in our part of the world is that it can withstand below-zero temperatures. Asiatic bittersweet’s trick is that it thrives in sun or shade, forest or city lot, is fire-resilient, and can be spread both by birds and via underground roots. This canny plant has it all covered — and not only the unwitting trees.
Are our ridgelines doomed to be eclipsed by counterfeit canopies? We can start being proactive by becoming aware of them. One challenge is that these plants drift in slowly so that you don’t notice until they’re wreaking havoc — just like I was caught unawares by what I’d initially thought were treetops. At first glimpse you assume that it’s green so it must be fine.
It’s important to bring fresh eyes to the scene. Then you can acquaint yourself with the specific vines. Once familiar with the plants, you’re more likely to catch them early, before they’re established or setting fruit, while it’s still easy to pull them out by hand. Let them dry in the sun and then dispose of them safely.
For large vines that are rooted in, get them out of the canopy to keep them grounded. Mike says to cut them at the base and flag them so you can do repeat cuttings to eradicate the vines. (Eventually the plant will exhaust its reserves.)
This way, birds — those vectors of aggressive seeds — won’t have access to the berries. And watch for seedlings, which you can yank out before they get their hold on a tree.
We should also be prepared for what’s ahead. On his travels through the region Mike has seen signs that more troublesome climbers are coming our way. “Up and down the Hudson River you can see vast stretches of non-native greenery,” he says. “River corridors, rail lines and roadways are the fingers poking northward into the heart of New England.” It’s worth knowing that kudzu has come up as far north as Massachusetts.
Mike recently came by and I showed him the faux treeline. What struck him was the hole in the forest canopy, a 100-feet in diameter circle where the trees had collapsed inward. The vines were still there, sending tendrils to the next row of trees. He had just been in the Berkshires and said this was the exact pattern he observed in Massachusetts, including in Lenox’s Kennedy Park, where the kiwi reigns.
It’s on us to keep our eye on the vines. Our local trees are worth it.

Does your heart fill with mean-spirited joy at the thought of human beings stuffed into tents and FEMA trailers parked on a disused airstrip in the heart of the Everglades in the middle of a Florida summer?
Do you get off on the idea of alligators and snakes killing people and admire bully capitalism hawking camo beverage coolers, stickers, and T-shirts with grinning reptiles proclaiming, “Nowhere to Run; Nowhere to Hide”?
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier certainly does: He’s raising campaign cash on his own little merch site.
Other paid-up members of the Cruelty is the Point cult do, too.
Celebrating the erection of Florida’s own gulag, known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” the state Republican Party bosses trilled, “Don’t forget to pick up your swag to support our efforts to undo all of Joe Biden’s failures!”
We are ruled by sociopaths.
This prison, parked in the middle of Big Cypress National Preserve, has already received hundreds of detainees, packed into rough-and-ready structures that have not had to meet any building or environmental codes and may not be able to withstand a tropical storm.
Cult leaders can’t decide if the place is Devil’s Island or a charmingly rustic resort.
Showing Donald Trump around the place, Ron DeSantis pointed to the razor wire, iron bunk beds, and bright new Astroturf on the ground.
The first batch of detainees don’t seem especially grateful. Those who’ve managed to make a phone call to the outside world say the guards have served them maggot-laced food, refused them medical attention, kept bright lights on all night, and either crank up the air conditioning until the detainees freeze or cut it off and let them swelter.
One alleged foreign malefactor says guards confiscated his Bible.

 Gators in ICE caps
Trump loves this. He fantasizes about terrified detainees chased by Burmese pythons and “cops that are in the form of alligators.”
The White House has put out a Trump meme with a gaggle of gators in ICE caps.
The Trump administration is proud of this latest monument to hatred and gets very upset if anyone criticizes it.
Stephen Miller, architect of Trump’s immigration policy, flew into a tantrum the other day when a reporter told him inhabitants of the human world were calling the South Florida stalag “dehumanizing.”
“American citizens are stripped of their rights and their liberties by the invasion of illegal aliens!” he replied. “What’s ‘dehumanizing’ is when Democrats let illegal alien rapists into the country to attack our children. That is ‘dehumanizing’!”
He failed to explain exactly how people fleeing murderous dictatorships in Venezuela, El Salvador, and Nicaragua take rights and liberties from citizens.
As for those hideous assaults alleged by Miller, American citizens commit far more crimes than undocumented immigrants.
The administration knows this. Until a few weeks ago, a Department of Justice website contained information confirming it.
Attorney General Pam Bondi shut down the website for “review” in “accordance with recent Executive Orders and related guidance.”
Why let data get in the way of propaganda?
 ‘Not safe’
Miller, Trump, and DeSantis insist the people ICE rounds up are “the worst of the worst, the most heinous of the most heinous.”
Again, the data show this is not true. Only 8% of undocumented detainees have been convicted of violent crimes.
This country is still — nominally — a nation of laws, and everyone thrown into an ICE dungeon is entitled to due process.
Even our supine Supreme Court agrees.
But Florida’s tropical tent prison makes it nearly impossible for detainees to consult with attorneys, meaning they could be deported without fair hearings.
A group of lawmakers, including Rep. Anna Eskamani and Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, tried to visit the facility a couple of weeks ago. Inmates from the Orange County jail — which is in Eskamani’s and Smith’s districts — had been transferred there without being charged with anything.
Legislators pointed out Florida Statute 944.23 allows them to visit state facilities “at their pleasure.”
But DeSantis’ people insist the Everglades prison camp is not technically a state facility, not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections.
Even though the state of Florida’s paying for it.
 ‘Emergency’ powers
Actually, the Trump administration admits it’s a state facility.
In a filing asking a federal judge to deny a request by Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biodiversity to halt construction in Big Cypress, the administration argues the plaintiffs’ claim depends on showing a final federal “agency action,” which they can’t because the feds haven’t “implemented, authorized, directed or funded Florida’s temporary detention center.”
Indeed, they insist, “Florida is constructing and operating the facility using state funds on state lands.”
DeSantis, Uthmeier, and Pam Bondi need to get their stories straight.
By last Saturday, legal problems had been overcome and the gulag had miraculously become “safe.”
A group of legislators got a curated tour, during which what you saw depended on who you were—and whether you gave a damn about the human beings locked up in there.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Florida) took a thermometer with her, reporting an indoor temperature of at least 83 degrees.
Another Democratic lawmaker said some detainees were shackled to benches.
Republican state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia insisted it’s pretty nice: “I actually laid down in one of the beds and it was really comfortable.”
Sure. And everybody’s talked to a lawyer, there are no mosquitoes, and tropical storms? No problem!
Meanwhile back in reality, DeSantis’ vanity project has already flooded at least once.
Big Cypress is 96% wetlands. It’s wetlands’ job to flood.
When Ron DeSantis, claiming “emergency” powers, seized 39 square miles of Everglades land (nearly 25,000 acres) he claimed, “The environmental impact will be zero.”
DeSantis and the attorney general contend they’re merely taking over what Uthmeier calls “an old, virtually abandoned” airstrip.”
That airstrip is abandoned for a reason. It’s a relic of one of the most boneheaded ideas anyone in Florida ever had.
The Phoenix’s own Craig Pittman recently recounted how in 1968 a really stupid plan to build a huge airport in the Everglades galvanized support for preserving Florida’s River of Grass.
Fun fact: It was Florida’s then-Gov. Claude Kirk and his top aide Nathaniel Reed — who went on to help pass the Clean Water Act in 1972 and co-write the Endangered Species Act in 1973 — who led the fight to save Big Cypress.
Both were Republicans.
 Vandals
Back then, some conservatives wanted to conserve, not destroy.
DeSantis and Uthmeier belong to a new generation of environmental vandals.
They want us to believe Big Cypress is wasted space with a few snakes, some bugs, a cadre of demonic alligators programmed to chase brown folks.
Inconsequential. Nothing to see there.
The ignorance is embarrassing.
To the Miccosukee and the Seminoles, the land is holy: “We live here. Our ancestors fought and died here. They are buried here,” said one tribal leader. “The Big Cypress is part of us, and we are a part of it.”
The land is not empty, or “abandoned.”
Manatees and dolphins give birth to their young in the estuaries on the eastern side. Mullet, trout, grouper, silver perch, spiny lobster, oysters, and clams thrive amongst the mangrove roots.
The mangrove branches harbor herons, pelicans, and egrets; there are red cockaded woodpeckers, fox squirrels, and Florida panthers in the pinelands, and some of the world’s rarest orchids in the cypress swamps.
The land is a vital ecosystem for plants and animals and humans, too. Its water flows are essential to the aquifer on which South Floridians depend for their drinking water.
DeSantis likes to cast himself as the savior of the River of Grass and waxes petulant if you suggest his pet prison will damage the ecosystem: “I’m the governor who’s poured more money into Everglades restoration than anyone!”
And now he’s poured more money into Everglades destruction than anyone.
The camp will cost $450 million a year to run.

 Don’t be gaslit
Don’t let the man gaslight you: Claims they’re not desecrating Big Cypress are complete rubbish.
Friends of the Everglades has aerial photographs showing the building of new roads and paving once-wild areas.
Runoff from asphalt pollutes. The huge trucks lumbering in and out of the site, carrying construction materials, also pollute.
You can’t house and feed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people, without terrible damage to already fragile nature.
They’ll need pesticides to keep the Everglades’ vigorous mosquitoes at bay; they’ll need generators and microwaves and machinery to pump out the sewage.
The gulag is even sullying the night sky.
One of the lawsuits filed by conservation groups points out the huge prison lights make the place “look like Yankee Stadium, visible from 15-miles away.”
Big Cypress has been designated an International Dark Sky Place. You used to be able to see the Milky Way arching over the marshes and hammocks like a necklace of diamonds and pearls.
Trumpists probably don’t look up at the heavens. They don’t look down at the wonders of the earth.

(Getty Images)“Why is health care so expensive?” is the question I’ve been asked more than any other since joining the Indiana Hospital Association last year. It’s a critically important one, and while my answer usually begins with, “It’s complicated,” one thing is now certain: 
Reducing Indiana’s health care costs became even more complicated as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which is projected to cut nearly $13 billion from Indiana hospitals over the next decade. 
The effects of this legislation will trickle down to all Hoosier patients — not just those on Medicaid — as hospitals are forced to cost-shift these significant losses in the coming years.
Impact on Hoosier patients
It’s undeniable that many of Indiana’s hospitals are financially strained. This year alone in our state, Harrison County Hospital, a rural hospital, closed its OB unit, and Columbus Regional Hospital announced a significant reduction in services. In addition, Logansport Memorial Hospital and Parkview Health entered into a partnership to ensure Hoosiers in Cass County continue to have access to care close to home.
Under the OBBBA, 180,000 individuals in Indiana are estimated to lose their Medicaid coverage. But Hoosiers without any insurance are still going to seek treatment — and their local hospital will be the only place they can turn to, most likely in the emergency room, which is the most expensive option for care. Hospitals will be forced to make difficult decisions to cover the care for everyone who enters their doors, regardless of their ability to pay, as health care costs are only going to increase in the future.
The ensuing ripple effect will likely bring about longer wait times for patients in emergency rooms and overall reduced access to care. Communities throughout the state will see possible hospital staffing impacts, reductions to clinical and community services, and in some instances, additional consolidation or closure of health care facilities altogether.
Projected losses for Indiana and its hospitals
According to the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the expected Medicaid reductions from the OBBBA will cost Indiana an estimated $31 billion over the next decade, the seventh-highest total dollar impact across the nation. In other words, only six states will see higher cuts than Indiana.
Of that, Indiana hospitals will lose $12.7 billion with even lower Medicaid reimbursement than they receive today, which is just 57 cents on the dollar.
Throughout the state, 67% of care provided by hospitals is paid for by Medicare or Medicaid. Imagine running a business where two-thirds of your customers are purchasing your product at a price far below your actual costs. No business can sustain such losses for long. And your local hospital is no different.

Medicare and Medicaid make up an even higher percentage of care provided in rural communities, in which 72% of patients are covered by these programs, and largely why nearly one-third of Indiana’s rural hospitals are today operating at a loss.
Rural hospitals will fare no better than their urban and suburban counterparts, even after the inclusion of the new rural hospital stabilization funding in the OBBBA to offset the future Medicaid cuts. While details of how the funds will be allotted are still unknown, we appreciate Congress enacting this measure. Unfortunately, it won’t be enough to cover expected losses, and there is no additional assistance following the end of the OBBBA’s five-year period. 
As dire as the situation is for Indiana, we would be in far worse shape had state policymakers not taken decisive action this past legislative session to supplement Indiana’s low Medicaid reimbursement through a new State Directed Payment Program (SDPP), which will provide hospitals some slightly enhanced Medicaid funding. IHA very much appreciates Gov. Mike Braun and the Indiana General Assembly for recognizing the need for this critical funding to help sustain Hoosier hospitals and protect access for patients. 
However, under the OBBBA, this new SDPP reimbursement that hospitals will be depending on will be short-lived as it will begin to phase down over five years beginning in 2028, and Indiana’s Medicaid reimbursement for hospitals will drop even lower in 2032 than it is today.

Despite these significant challenges, Indiana hospitals remain committed to working with federal and state officials to find the best path forward to ensure continued access to affordable health care for all Hoosiers. It will take all of us – hospitals, policy leaders, payors, employers, and consumers – to come to the table to find workable solutions. The financial stability of our entire health system and the 6.8 million Hoosier lives it serves are depending on it.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota is in the midst of a housing shortage. We need more than 100,000 new homes to meet the needs of Minnesota residents, families and communities. And as someone who has recently been out in the housing market, looking for a new place to call home, I can say first hand: This shortage of homes has real consequences.
As noted in a recent Reformer article, “Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners” potential homeowners face stiff competition, bidding wars and very few homes that are affordable to people who earn the average Minnesota wage. 
Renters face an even bleaker situation, with rents rising rapidly in communities across the state, and little options to move and find lower rents. This competition is the direct result of the lack of homes. 
The ripple effects of this affects more than just the people looking to find a home. 
Workers can’t find jobs close to home, leaving them to commute longer and longer distances, spending time away from their families. 
Employers can’t find people to work who live within a reasonable distance, who can easily get to work reliably. 
Young people can’t stay in the communities they grew up in, meaning they live further and further away from families and support networks. 
And, older adults ready to downsize can’t find new homes to move to that are accessible and affordable, leaving them stuck in big houses that are too much to take care of.
Minnesotans are being shut out of the communities they want to live in, and one of the causes is that cities are maintaining a set of inflexible and exclusionary rules to prevent the homes we need and want from being built. As a state, we could allow townhomes, duplexes, backyard cottages and apartments above shops. We used to allow these choices, but cities across our state have adopted rules that prevent these home types from being built in a movement to exclude people that goes back to the early 20th century. 
It’s time for a change. As Sen. Jordan Rasmusson of Fergus Falls said during a legislative hearing this year, “On housing policy, the aspiration ought to be that Minnesotans choose the communities they want to live in, not let communities pick which Minnesotans get to live there.”  At every stage of life, Minnesotans should be able to find a home that meets their needs — but city rules are intentionally holding us back this goal.
In my own home search, I found just a few options in my price range that also met my criteria. I wanted to live a walkable distance to my father, and in a place that allowed pets. Like many of my generation, I’m concerned with climate change, so having a place that would share walls and utilities with other households was a priority. Studies show that having multiple homes under one roof that share walls experience less heat loss, and use less energy to heat and cool the same space.
Sadly, while the Legislature had an opportunity to address this problem this past session — bipartisan, bicameral bills that would have allowed more home types to be built in more communities — they chose not to act. Instead, legislators chose to allow the cities to delay addressing our housing shortage, to deny they are part of the problem, and to continue to exclude Minnesotans.  
The good news? Advocates like us will be back at the Capitol next year, ready to share our stories, and to demand that legislators take action to allow more homes. 
Home is too important to leave to a patchwork of local laws designed to exclude people. We know we can solve this problem — we just need our state leaders to act like it too.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-49-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 07:10:46.639014

Minnesota has among the most costly child care in the nation. (Photo by Getty Images) Minnesota’s fertility rate is following national trends downward. It could spell trouble for the economy and state budget, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank. 
In 2023, Minnesota had its lowest fertility rate in more than 30 years. Measured by the number of children born per 1,000 women between 15 and 44 years old, it was 55.7 compared to an average of 64.2 between 2011 and 2020. This drop was slightly higher than the national average. 
Historically, fertility rates have decreased during economic downturns but later bounced back. This changed after the 2008 recession, and the beginning of the pandemic saw a drop without a long-term recovery. 
The state may see some benefits from the fertility decline in the short term, with fewer students driving lower education costs. The number of elementary-age public school students has been decreasing at a slow pace for almost a decade, in part due to falling birth rates. But this also has the potential to reduce enrollment-based federal funding, such as Title I grants. 
In the long run, however, the working age population will be smaller, decreasing tax revenues  and economic growth. This new economic reality is arriving soon: The children born during the 2008 recession — when fertility rates were low — will reach adulthood in 2026. 
The size of Minnesota’s workforce is an ongoing concern, particularly as baby boomers retire. In October 2024, there were two job openings for every one unemployed worker. 
The current fertility rate decline is being driven in part by who is having children and when. Fertility rates are down among teenagers and Hispanic women. People are also waiting longer to have children and having fewer kids over their lifetimes. 
Researchers attribute these trends to financial considerations like student debt, housing costs and the price of child care. Minnesota has among the most costly child care in the nation. 
Societal changes also play a role, as more people prioritize their education and careers and marry later in life. 
But fertility rates aren’t the only demographics that are changing. Migration and an aging population paint a complicated picture for Minnesota’s future. 
In 2024, international and domestic migration was the biggest contributor to population growth in every state except Alaska. In 2023, foreign-born workers made up 10.9% of Minnesota’s labor force. International immigration has declined significantly under President Trump’s policies, which is likely to impact the labor market. 
As the population ages, funding the increasing costs of health care and long-term care for older adults will also prove a challenge, especially with the fewer workers resulting from a low fertility rate. This comes as impending federal Medicaid cuts shift more of these costs to states.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1532870985-1024x461.jpg,,,2025-07-14 07:10:46.639014

(Connect Images for Getty Images)In the face of growing health care costs, many employers have turned to self-insured plans, where they assume the financial risks on the chance that they might save some money. And it’s a popular option for Hoosiers. 
Even as reliance on self-insured, or self-funded, plans shrinks across the country, the insurance option is growing in Indiana. The average privately employed Hoosier is 20% more likely to be enrolled in a self-insured plan than the average privately employed American. 
  Dr. Nir Menachemi, Dean of the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at Indiana University (Photo from IU)
Dr. Nir Menachemi, the dean of the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, co-authored a study published in November breaking down the reasons for Indiana’s health care costs. One of the most significant takeaways was Indiana’s reliance on self-insured plans when compared to the national average.
“Indiana is bucking the trend nationally and in the neighborhood in terms of … having more people in self-insured plans,” said Menachemi. 
Nationwide, self-insured plans fell by 6.64% between 2020 and 2024. All of Indiana’s neighbors reported decreases in their self-insured rate but Indiana bucked the trend — instead increasing by 6.11% during that time. 
In Indiana, two-thirds of private sector employees are enrolled in self-insured plans — but this number is likely an undercount, since the data only includes private-sector employees. Some of Indiana’s largest self-insured, public organizations aren’t included in this analysis. 
But self-insured employers are also likely to pay more in hospital costs. The relatively high number of self-insured employers compared to other states might also help to explain why lawmakers have focused much of their attention on reducing hospital costs as part of their overall efforts to tackle the state’s high health care costs. 
 What is a self-insured plan?

Self-insured plans are one of a handful of options available to employers looking to purchase health insurance plans for their employees. For certain employers — especially those with a relatively healthy workforce — opting for a self-insured plan can be a way to reduce health care costs.
Actuaries will calculate an estimated cost for insuring a workforce and a fully insured plan will include some overhead for the insurer administering the plan. Insurers, seeking a profit, will also set a premium that allows for that while also accounting for any state-specific administrative costs. 
“Insurance is buying and selling risk. Self-insurance means not buying and selling risk. And if I know my population is healthy enough and, generally speaking, more educated — why should I pay someone else to take the risk that I’m happy to bear myself?” Menachemi said. “I’ll put all that money in the bank and just pay for people’s health care as they need it.”
IU study: Indiana stands out for its reliance on self-insured, high-deductible plans

The employer can then keep whatever’s left unused at the end of the year. 
But the plans come with a significant drawback: a loss in contract negotiating power. 
Parties negotiate prices with each contract, with insurers using their large pools of enrollees to get lower prices from providers like hospitals. These negotiations are largely impacted by the presence of competitors, such as multiple insurance options or health systems. 
But self-insured employers don’t have that same strength, even though they are likely to tap insurers as Third Party Administrators to handle billing services and the like, including provider arrangements. Menachemi noted that researchers don’t have access to a lot of details about administrators and payment decisions, which are usually considered proprietary and typically are only publicized following a lawsuit. 
Previously, those third-party administrators didn’t have any specifically outlined duty to employers, though a recent legislative effort seeks to rebalance the scales. 
“I’m super eager to see how this all plays out,” said Menachemi, also naming other health care priority bills from the 2025 session, such as one studying hospital pricing. 
Menachemi’s analysis, a follow-up from a similar study in 2020, recommended that self-insured employers counter this by grouping together for their negotiations to seek lower provider prices. 
“If six large employers got together and basically said, ‘We want to buy insurance together.’ That’s a purchasing alliance and then they’d have more power than any one of them alone,” Menachemi said. “That’s a market solution that doesn’t require regulatory intervention.”
State lawmakers can’t regulate self-insured plans because they fall under a federal law known as ERISA, or the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act. Initially developed to create a universal set of standards for insurers across state lines, legislators have been stymied in some of their transparency efforts by the federal statute because they can’t compel companies to participate in efforts like the All Payers Claims Database. 
At a panel with the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute at the end of May, employers of some of Indiana’s largest employers shared their perspectives on growing health care costs.
Lawrence McCormack, the director of government relations with Cummins, said the company operated in all 50 states — making self-insurance attractive — and had “some visibility” when it came to different costs across state lines. 
“Indiana’s costs are higher than what we see in some other states and so what we do, and what we’ve been doing for the last five or 10 years, is really working with the legislature, with some of the policy makers, to figure out, how do we address these health care costs?” McCormack said. “… we just want to see that addressed because it is truly making Indiana less competitive with our neighboring states when we’ve done such a good job of creating a really strong business climate here.”

But, as the IU study also details, Hoosiers are generally less healthy than other Americans, across various measures for mortality, asthma, smoking, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
Overall, Indiana’s mortality rate is 16% higher than the nation’s rate. Public health efforts seeking to reverse these stats have recently seen significant state funding cuts.

For the most part, the average employee wouldn’t notice a difference between a fully insured or self-insured plan. However, self-insured plans are more likely to also have lower monthly premiums but higher deductibles. 
This requires an enrollee to pay more out-of-pocket costs — another area where Indiana is an outlier — before insurance coverage starts. 
The prevalence of high-deductible health plans — which covers 64% of Hoosiers compared to 54% nationally — partially explains why Hoosiers pay more in out-of-pocket costs than their peers as employers shift costs to employees in another attempt to save money. While this plan type grew by 9% nationwide between 2020 and 2024, it increased by 23% in Indiana. 
According to a New York Times article from earlier this month, health care industries are now the top employer in 38 states — but not Indiana, where manufacturing is still the top employer. Outside of manufacturing, other labor-intensive industries — such as agriculture, which is also a major Indiana employer — are more likely to be self-insured than other professions. 
With these types of companies playing an outsized role in Indiana, it’s clear that self-insurance is something stakeholders will continue to consider in the face of increasing health care costs. 
“If you want to be a business-friendly state, you’re going to attract the kinds of employers that are increasingly … going to be self-insured,” Menachemi said.

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)A Republican-led effort to make Washington residents prove they are U.S. citizens before receiving a ballot is hitting the streets.
Backers of an initiative requiring a person to provide proof of citizenship as part of the voter registration process have begun gathering signatures after a Thurston County judge settled a dispute on how the measure would be described on ballots.
Under the proposed measure, one would need an enhanced driver’s license or enhanced identicard, or present another form of identification like a passport or birth certificate at a county auditor’s office when they first register. Existing voters would have their registrations canceled if they fail to produce such proof by the November 2027 election when the changes would take effect.
This would be a seismic political change. On the current Washington voter registration form, a person marks a box indicating they are a citizen.
“This says you just can’t check a box,” said Jim Walsh, a state lawmaker from Aberdeen and chair of the Washington State Republican Party, who filed Initiative to the Legislature 126, or IL-26. “This does not touch mail-in voting in any way. It does not touch the transaction of voting.”
Walsh said the measure is intended to complement an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that, broadly, seeks to make states require individuals to show proof of citizenship to register.  That order, which threatened to cut federal funds to states that did not comply, is currently blocked by a legal challenge.
Opponents contend the “confusing and onerous” in-person proof-of-citizenship requirements will deter potential new voters from registering and knock existing voters from the rolls. 
“No matter what we look like or where we come from, all voters in Washington must have the opportunity to make their voices heard at the ballot box,” said Roxana Norouzi, executive director of OneAmerica, a statewide immigrant rights organization.
OneAmerica challenged a portion of the ballot title last month. It argued that the proposed four-word statement of the subject matter – “concerns voter registration requirements” – did not adequately describe the breadth of the impact.
Last Thursday, Thurston County Superior Court Judge John Skinder ordered the statement be revised to read the measure “concerns heightened voter registration requirements for applicants and currently registered voters.”
OneAmerica officials said this is a clearer statement of what the policy is about.
Walsh was happy with the outcome, confident that the additional wording will be beneficial for gathering signatures. “I think it’s lovely. This idea polls astronomically well,” he said. 
To be eligible for the ballot, supporters must turn in at least 308,911 registered voters by Jan 2, 2026.
As an initiative to the Legislature, if they have the requisite number, it will first go to lawmakers who could adopt it as written. If they do not act, the measure would then go on the November 2026 ballot. Legislators could approve an alternative to be placed on the ballot alongside the initiative if they want, as well.
Under the proposed measure, a person registering for the first time must complete the voter registration form as well as have one of the required documents. 
For existing voters, county auditors, by July 1, 2027 must work with the state Department of Licensing to see which ones have an enhanced driver’s license or identicard. Those that do remain registered automatically.
Those who do not will get a notice to go to their county auditor’s office and present one of the approved documents to show they are a citizen. Reminder notices must be sent. A voter has up until 14 days before the November 2027 election to produce documents.
In 2023, Walsh teamed up with Let’s Go Washington, founded and led by fund manager Brian Heywood, to qualify six initiatives to the Legislature. Lawmakers adopted three and voters rejected the other three when they appeared on the November 2024 ballot.
Let’s Go Washington was not involved as of Friday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ballots-Large-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 07:10:46.639014

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.



There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

“I did not get one call, email, etc., when I introduced this last session,” Cohn said, a Democrat who represents a southern portion of St. Louis city. “And then all of a sudden, it’s like everyone is coming out of the woodwork — and I haven’t even requested a hearing on this yet.”
His bill would prohibit hemp-derived THC beverages and edibles from being sold outside of marijuana dispensaries, which would effectively ban them. Intoxicating hemp products, sometimes labeled as “Delta-8,”  have largely been unregulated in Missouri since 2018, when Congress passed a Farm Bill that legalized hemp.
This year, Cohn gotten calls from “every single media outlet,” he said, along with hemp beverage distributors, hemp edible companies and lobbyists.
His bill comes right on the heels of a heated battle between St. Louis-area state senators this spring over a similar proposal.
Cohn’s bill has the same language as the legislation sponsored by conservative Republican state Sen. Nick Schroer of Defiance this year.
Intoxicating hemp regulations stall in Missouri Senate after 7-hour filibuster

In April, Schroer’s proposal was met by fierce opposition from St. Louis Democratic state senators Karla May, Steve Roberts and Angela Mosley, who led a seven-hour filibuster to kill the bill.
“It reminds me so much of a street drug war,” said May, during a Senate floor debate on April 9, “where you got these people over here saying you can’t infringe on my territory…I don’t think we should be using law to create an unfair business advantage.”
Several Republican state senators backed the filibuster, saying they were also opposed to what they described as a “monopolistic attempt” by the marijuana industry to squash its competition. 
Now the fight has been taken to a local stage, where both the St. Louis County Council and St. Louis city’s Board of Aldermen are considering an effective ban as well.
In January, St. Louis County Councilwoman Lisa Clancy proposed a nearly identical bill to Cohn’s and is only one vote away from the bill’s final passage. She said she hasn’t heard from the St. Louis senators who filibustered or industry members. 
The bill tasks the county’s health department with enforcement — including seizing and destroying the products. She’s been working with the county health department, she said, to make sure its leaders understand how it will be implemented before taking it to a final vote.
Clancy, Cohn and Schroer all argue that it isn’t an industry war but a “public health crisis.”
The St. Louis city and county legislation differs from Schroer’s because he ended up carving out an exception for low-dose THC beverages that have been sold in Missouri’s bars and liquor stores for seven years. It still required things like high-dose gummies, THCA flower and vapes to only be sold in marijuana dispensaries.  
Cohn sees the bill he filed on June 27 as a “placeholder,” he said, and he wants to have a discussion about how to move forward with regulation. 
“I’m happy to have the conversations to get to the end result where we’re protecting kids and health and welfare,” he said. “It’s not only the idea that there’s not even an age limit on these things. You don’t know what people are putting in these synthetic products.”
Cohn has strong support from the city’s aldermanic president Megan Green, who co-sponsored the bill. 
“The fact that largely untested, unregulated, and untaxed products can be purchased at gas stations by kids is simply not sustainable,” Green told The Independent in an email last week.
Mayor Cara Spencer did not respond to The Independent’s requests for comment regarding the issue. 
St. Louis County Executive Sam Page didn’t mention a particular stance in his statement to The Independent, but said, “There needs to be robust discussion on what regulation would look like, and I appreciate Councilwoman Clancy leading these efforts.”
A product ban
  State Rep. Dave Hinman, a Republican from O’Fallon, toured the warehouse of St. Louis-based Triple High Seltzer, a hemp-derived THC beverage, on Feb. 7 with the company’s founder Will Spartin (Rebecca Rivas/The Missouri Independent).
Hemp naturally has very little THC, the intoxicating component mostly associated with marijuana. But that potency can be increased with some science.
While marijuana products must be sold in dispensaries and be grown and manufactured in state-regulated facilities, intoxicating hemp products are completely unregulated by any governmental agency. 
There’s no state or federal law saying teenagers or children can’t buy them or stores can’t sell them to minors. However, some stores and vendors have taken it upon themselves to impose age restrictions of 21 and up.










I don’t think we need to move everything into dispensaries. And two, I don’t think it’s a good idea for city-by-city regulation.


– State Rep. Dave Hinman of O'Fallon


If the St. Louis bills pass, all intoxicating hemp products would be put under the state’s definition of marijuana — which would create a ban on available products. 
Here’s why: Licensed cannabis dispensaries wouldn’t be able to sell these intoxicating hemp products either because the hemp used to make them has to be grown in Missouri and processed in licensed cultivation and manufacturing facilities – just as marijuana is. Nearly all of these products currently on the market are made from hemp grown in other states. 
Marijuana licenses are also limited.
That’s why the state lawmakers who filibustered argued the legislation would cause a “marijuana monopoly.” 
Another St. Louis player — Steven Busch, who owns St. Peters-based Krey Distributing — pushed for an alternative licensing structure this year that looks more similar to how alcohol and tobacco retailers are licensed.
He worked with Republican state Rep. Dave Hinman of O’Fallon on a bill to allow beverages, edibles and vapes to continue to be sold outside of dispensaries, but be licensed and regulated under the Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Control. 
Hinman’s proposal required age restrictions and clear labeling on all products, as well as testing to be completed by independent labs that have the same accreditation the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation requires of licensed marijuana testing labs.
In the end, there were too many differing opinions among hemp industry members to get the bill passed. 
A sticking point for Busch was THCA flower, which looks and acts like marijuana buds. He believes it shouldn’t be sold outside of a dispensary, and other hemp advocates ardently disagreed.
Busch said it’s a “slippery slope” for municipalities to pass laws that ban everything in this category. 
“I think that some of it can be safe,” Busch said, “but some of it is really taking advantage of the Farm Bill and should be banned.”
Busch agreed with the carve out in Schroer’s bill that capped the amount of THC at five milligrams per can. It excluded drinks made with “synthetic” THC, or THC that has been converted from CBD using a chemical process. 
Other advocates said the cap on THC was too low and limiting.
Hinman will be filing another bill next year, he said, incorporating all the conversations he had throughout the past legislative session. 
“I don’t think we need to move everything into dispensaries,” he said. “And two, I don’t think it’s a good idea for city-by-city regulation. I believe 100% this should be done statewide through the state legislature.”
Missouri cities of Gladstone, Farmington and Chesterfield have already passed municipal ordinances that ban or highly restrict these products.
Intoxicating gummies
  Gov. Mike Parson speaks at his Capitol press conference in August 2024 announcing Executive Order 24-10 that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products in Missouri “until such time approved sources can be regulated by the FDA or State of Missouri through legislative action,” he said. (photo courtesy of Missouri Governor’s Office).
Last summer, Total Wine — the country’s largest liquor retailer — set the tone for the alcohol industry when it began carrying hemp-derived THC infused beverages at its seven Missouri stores. 
One of its featured products was intoxicating hemp seltzers from St. Louis-based company Mighty Kind.
“It has been amazing for us,” Joshua Grigaitis, owner of Mighty Kind, told The Independent last summer. “When somebody like Total Wine comes on board, it helps the conversation along greatly.”
In some St. Louis bars, his products make up 30-40% of their sales, he said.
Grigaitis and his team have spent the last seven years educating people on how they make their products and why they can buy a THC product outside of a dispensary — because the 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp.
He welcomes regulation, he said, because it would help the industry grow. But that conversation has stalled out among state lawmakers the last two years.
That’s why – not long after Grigaitis learned about Total Wine last year – former Gov. Mike Parson signed an executive order last August banning intoxicating hemp products and threatening penalties to any establishment with a Missouri liquor license or that sells food products for selling them. 
Like the St. Louis bills, he tasked the state health department with enforcement.
Ultimately, Parson’s order was put on hold a month later, after a series of political and legal barriers. 
Grigaitis said he can only speak for the hemp beverage industry but there are a number of testing and other compliance requirements that distributors and retailers like Total Wine require in order to “just do business.” 
“Everybody has a list of things you have to do to qualify or be compliant,” he said. “So it’s not like this wild west.”
Clancy said she’s “not looking to put Mighty Kind out of business.”
“I’m not trying to ram anything through quickly without stakeholder input and getting something that works for those people,” she said. “My concerns are about the shady actors.”
Like Parson and Cohn, Clancy said she’s most concerned about the edibles. She said she has test results from edibles purchased from stores in the county and city. 
“And what they’re finding is that these are made out of things like mulch,” she said. “I know people personally who purchased them from convenience stores and have gotten sick.”
In terms of beverages, Brian Dix, owner of St. Louis city-based Craft Republic alcohol distributing company, said the bill will just push people to go buy hemp beverages online. Some of his seltzers are top items in the Tik Tok shop. 
“It’s a massive industry,” he said of online sales and social media marketing. “If the city is taking this kind of position, it doesn’t make me want to stay in the city.”

Researchers have studied how greenspace influences human health. These forest bathing participants find benefit in surrounding themselves with nature.

Kate Kampner is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.
BURLINGTON — While sitting on the hills of Shelburne Farms, a sustainable education farm near Burlington, Kelly Knudsen was given an invitation. She, along with the group she sat near, were asked what movement they could see. At first, Knudsen, confused by the question, didn’t see anything.
Then, she focused. She saw the soft swaying of singular branches, the slight shift in fine blades of grass, the unexpected appearance of a bird, and clouds, making their slow expedition towards her. 
That newfound attention is what forest bathing is all about, according to Knudsen. The process of slowing down, a process that Knudsen began even before she received a diagnosis of non-cancerous meningioma in December. 
Forest bathing, based off the Japanese practice “Shinrin-yoku,” emphasizes intentionally surrounding oneself in nature and staying focused on the present. It can take many forms such as meditating, walking, or group discussions. As forest bathing gains popularity in Vermont and New York, some have begun pursuing the therapeutic act as part of their healing journey through complex medical conditions. 
Stacey LaFave, an oncology social worker, hit her wall with healthcare and became a certified forest bathing guide through the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy Guides and Programs in 2022. 
LaFave now runs an eight-month forest bathing support group for cancer patients out of the initial treatment phase — the first line of treatment to control the cancer — through the CVPH Fitzpatrick Cancer Center, a hospital in Plattsburgh, New York that’s part of the University of Vermont Health Network. 
Between early April and November, her patients can attend bi-weekly, closed sessions in the woods of New York’s Point Au Roche State Park. She guided her first group last year and took on a second group in the spring. 
“The goal is to just walk and really notice, to get them out of their heads and into their bodies,” LaFave said. 
LaFave’s group members span a variety of ages and stages in cancers and treatments. The younger members are in their 40s and the oldest are in their 80s, LaFave said. One of her patients had been diagnosed with a second cancer during the sessions. LaFave said that being surrounded by a world of support helped her deal with the diagnosis. 
“I think she was at peace with it,” LaFave said. 
But typically, she said, cancer doesn’t take center stage. 
“We don’t talk about cancer that much,” LaFave said. “Maybe cancer was the one thing everybody had in common, but often people talked just about anything.” 
Through support groups like LaFave’s people around the world are implementing the practice into their healthcare decisions as researchers have found that medical patients who spend more time in greenspaces can see their health improve.
“People that engaged with this greenspace, they had more beneficial health outcomes,” said Dr. Jean Bikomeye, a researcher at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee who published a 2022 review showing that in five cancer-related studies, cancer patients who spent more time gardening, forest bathing, and just more time outside overall had improved health effects.  
“We saw improvement in strength and weight loss,” Bikomeye said. His team also saw an improvement in biological markers such as inflammation and an overall quality of life, according to the study. 
Knudsen, who participated in forest bathing sessions long before her diagnosis, saw the effects on her everyday life. 
“In today’s society it’s so hard for many of us to slow down and be present in the moment,” she said. But when you do that, she added, “You develop more of a gratitude for the natural world.”
Knudsen is an outdoor educator at Shelburne farms. She works with kids at the farm by getting them outside and fostering a relationship with the natural world. One activity she does with them is called “Fist Full of Sounds” where she gets the kids to stop, close their eyes, and shout out all the sounds they hear. 
“When kids are coming to the farm, a lot of the time they really just need to play and explore and be curious in the natural world,” she said. “To me, forest bathing is a way that as adults we’re going out and just playing in the forest and being curious about what’s around us.” 
Knudsen’s forest bathing sessions are also held at the farms and have always been led by Duncan Murdoch who has been a certified Nature Forest Therapy Guide since 2015. He guides primarily group walks with a variety of people. This includes those being affected by cancer. 
Around the same time Knudsen received her diagnosis, she learned from another session member that they had been diagnosed with cancer. The two of them have stayed connected beyond the forest bathing group ever since. 
“For three hours, you’re with people who get it,” Murdoch said. “That feels really healing.” 
Much like other guides, Murdoch uses all five senses as a means of focusing on the present. Smell, touch, sound, and sight come easy, but to experience taste, both he and LaFave make a tea at the end of their sessions, either out of plants or mushrooms. 
Six months after LaFave finished her 2024 session, she sent out a follow up survey to her patients who reflected on their experience and how it’s changed their lives.
“I got in touch with nature, made great friendships with others, and it gave me a large amount of personal growth,” said one anonymous patient. 
Another said that after the treatment their house was now full of houseplants. “I met other people who have taught me a lot about surviving positively after cancer,” another anonymous patient said.

(Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Billions of dollars at stake for farmers hit by Trump funding freeze, foreign aid pause

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
USDA cuts hit small farms as Trump showers billions on big farms

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Now that work on the state budget is complete, environmental groups and residents of communities affected by PFAS contamination believe progress can still be made on getting money out the door to help remediate water pollution across the state. 
Since the last biennial budget was passed, $125 million in funds meant to help with cleaning up contamination of water from PFAS has been sitting untouched with no legislative mechanism for getting that money out to communities.
PFAS, a family of man-made chemical compounds known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down in the environment, have been connected to cancer and other diseases. The chemicals have been used in products such as firefighting foam and household goods such as non-stick pans and fast food wrappers. Communities across the state have found PFAS contamination in their water. 
During the last legislative session, early hopes of compromise crumbled after Democrats and Republicans failed to reach agreement on a provision aimed at protecting “innocent landowners” from being subject to enforcement actions for PFAS contamination under the state’s toxic spills law by the Department of Natural Resources. 
Republicans, including the bill’s author, Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) argued the bill had to include language that protected people who have PFAS contamination on their property through no fault of their own. Democrats said the language in the bill defining innocent landowners was so broad that it would exempt property owners responsible for pollution from being held responsible. 
Ultimately, Gov. Tony Evers vetoed the bill. 
Wimberger and Rep. Tim Mursau (R-Crivitz) authored legislation this year to get the $125 million earmarked for PFAS remediation out the door. 
Sara Walling, Clean Wisconsin’s water and agriculture program director, says she’s “hopeful” that discussions between the Republican bill authors, Evers and affected residents have been productive. 
“There is opportunity now I think that the budget is done for Wimberger and others, of course, to pay attention, put a little energy into this, and really sit down and hash out the provisions in there, and get to a point that there’s something hopefully that we can all live with, and that will get the money to impacted communities and private well owners and all the things that the money is intended to be used for,” Walling says. 
While people see progress being made, there are still objections to the legislation. Wimberger and Mursau have proposed two bills, one of which exempts certain groups of people from enforcement under the spills law. 
Exempting ‘innocent landowners’
The exemptions include anyone who spread biosolids or wastewater contaminated with PFAS onto a field while in compliance with a DNR permit; owns land on which contaminated biosolids were spread under a permit; a fire department, public airport or municipality that used PFAS-contaminated firefighting foam to train for or respond to emergencies; solid waste disposal facilities that accepted PFAS and anyone that owns, leases, manages, or contracts for property on which PFAS has moved through the groundwater (unless they caused the contamination on another piece of property). 
Earlier this year, Evers suggested he’d support exempting farmers and residents from being held financially responsible for cleaning up PFAS contamination if they unknowingly caused it by spreading contaminated biosolids. 
But Walling says she’d like to see that language tightened further to make sure it does not create a loophole for responsible parties. 
“The provisions that are laid on that out there now just provide far too big of a loophole for who would be considered an innocent landowner in the current bill language,” she said. “And we really want to see that tightened so that truly innocent landowners, the passive receivers, the farmers out there who unknowingly were accepting municipal biosolids … those are the innocent landowners that I know that the authors are trying to protect.” 
What’s an allowable level of PFAS?
The other bill creates the mechanisms and grant programs through which the $125 million would be awarded to affected communities. 
Doug Oitzinger is the former mayor and a current city councilmember of Marinette and a founder of a group of community members fighting to clean up PFAS pollution in his area from the manufacture of fire suppression technologies by Tyco/Johnson Controls. 
Oitzinger says he’s wary of a provision in the bill that exempts private property owners who don’t qualify as innocent landowners from enforcement under the spills law unless the level of PFAS present violates an existing state or federal standard. The federal government doesn’t regulate groundwater and for years the state Department of Natural Resources has been unable to promulgate an administrative rule that sets the allowable amount of PFAS in groundwater. 
The DNR failed once because of a deadlocked vote on the state Natural Resources Board and a second time because the proposed rule had a potential economic impact greater than $10 million and therefore required approval of the full Legislature under a law known as the REINS Act. 
The DNR is currently working on the economic impact analysis of another proposed groundwater standard. Oitzinger says he’s doubtful that proposal will stay clear of the REINS Act. So, he says, he’s working with Mursau to include a groundwater standard in the bill. 
The most significant amendment Oitzinger is fighting for in the legislation is the creation of a temporary standard for the regulation of PFAS in Wisconsin’s groundwater. 
“We’ve been working to see if legislatively, we can get something that does not undermine the spills law to get the $125 million out the door, that the governor would sign, that we would be in support of and, at the same time, establish some kind of interim groundwater standard for PFAS,” Oitzinger says. 
As someone fighting for a community that’s been heavily polluted with PFAS, Oitzinger says his goal is to find a compromise that helps people get clean water, even if environmental and industry groups aren’t fully satisfied. 
“It doesn’t do us any good to get into our respective camps and not find common ground,” he says. “And then the bill reaches the governor’s office and he vetoes it. That’s not helping anybody, so we’ve got to find compromise. Some of the environmental groups won’t like it, and certainly I think some of the industry lobbying groups won’t like it, but this is what we’ve got to do.”

We do.
But only if we are willing to take a stand and exercise it.
There is power in numbers.
We do not need to capitulate and succumb to the money and influence of the rich and powerful, their lobbyists, or the feckless and spineless elected officials who make decisions in their own self-interests rather than do the jobs they were sent to Jefferson City and Washington to do. 
We do not have to accept it.
The Preamble to the Constitution is worth revisiting as frequently as necessary during these political times as we witness and become recipients of what our government is doing that will negatively impact our lives.
“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”
As much as we may feel intimidated by, or reluctant to spend time to better understand the empowerment of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Missouri, we need to. 
We need to pay close attention to the actions of elected officials in Jefferson City and Washington, and invest the time to determine how “we the people” can exercise the power we have to preserve our individual rights and our way of life as American citizens.
Before it is too late.
Before so much damage has been done that it will take years, if not decades, to recover.
Currently, and on many levels, we are experiencing what it is like to live in a country where its leaders seem hellbent on creating a hapless and hopeless society.
American optimism — all the positive energy, that can-do anything aura and attitude, the vision for a better life, a better society, a better world — where has it gone?
Is America becoming a country without compassion, courage, or one with a positive outlook for the future?
We seem to be under a cloud of discordant lies and deception, incivility, meanness, retribution, the grab and abuse of power among leaders and policymakers — all while those very perpetrators are trying to tell and convince us that such behavior is actually necessary to pass and implement policies for our own good.
Does our silence indicate we believe it, that we buy that the outcomes are in our best interest?
Why else is such behavior becoming the norm?
In Missouri, do you actually believe that denying workers family leave, for example, is good for low- or moderate-income employees? Do they not deserve some time off to take care of themselves or a family member when sick?
The Missouri governor with a stroke of pen cancelled paid sick leave, a measure that was passed overwhelming by 58% of voters. If that was not bad enough, the same bill signed into law also repeals the annual inflation adjustment to the minimum wage —something that has been done since 2006.
How will these actions help hardworking Missourians as the cost of living continues to rise?
Many Missourians, like many in other states, are at risk of losing their needed Medicaid benefits because the senators and representatives in Congress ultimately went along with the passage of future cuts.
On the national level, the promise to curb rising inflation, to control immigrants overtaking our borders, to end the war between Russia and Ukraine were the main reasons voters cast their votes for Republican candidates.
In reality, what has been done to successfully address those issues?
Not much.
What have we gotten instead? Indiscriminate deep destructive cuts in departments and services, putting the needs of many American at risk; inhumane and indiscriminate handling of illegal immigrants; and the war between Russia and Ukraine goes on.
And then there is passage of the “Big Beautiful Bill.
Do you know what is in it?
Do you know whether it will help or hurt one or more aspects of your quality of life?
You are probably thinking: If the elected officials we sent to Jefferson City and Washington are not functioning in our best interests — not stopping decisions and policies being passed that will hurt us — what can we do?
A lot.
First, prepare to vote those elected officials out of offices at the first opportunity. There is more power in the number of voters that go to the polls and vote than the money that may be infused in a campaign.
Money cannot vote.
Start now, if you haven’t, to keep a log of what your elected officials say and do. Just as important is to log what they fail to say or do when they have an opportunity. Did they go along to get along? Whose interests did they represent or fight for, if not yours?
Contact your elected officials repeatedly and in multiple ways. Taking time to write letters and make phone calls at a minimum. Meet with them at every opportunity. Encourage others in your orbit of influence and who share your concerns to join you. 
Research. Who is influencing, and contributing to elected officials? 
Organize. Discover whether there are eligible voters who are not voting for one reason or the other. Assist and encourage them to vote. Organize group discussions around issues you care about. Seek opportunities to participate in political organizations that share your concerns.
The greatest power that resides in the people is the “We.”
Will enough of us do what it takes to exercise that power and put it into action to make Missouri and America what they can be?
For the people.

Herbert pays for her 24/7 care through Medicaid, but this type of long-term care in her home is considered an optional benefit that states may offer under federal regulations. Herbert has been living under looming uncertainty about whether the service will be taken away after Congress this month passed a federal budget reconciliation bill that is expected to cut Medicaid spending by around $1 trillion over the next decade. 
“If they cut my Medicaid, I don’t know what to do, because I won’t move into a nursing home,” she said. “I can’t have my baby (Herbert’s cat Destiny is her “baby”) and people go to nursing homes to die.” 
The sweeping tax-and-spend bill passed by Congress July 1 makes a number of changes to Medicaid, and supporters and critics argue about how those will impact those who rely on the program for health care coverage. 
Many of the bill’s supporters, including Idaho’s Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, have said the bill’s reductions will protect the program for those who it was originally intended for, including children, pregnant women, and those with disabilities.

Kennedy Jr. to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services on Feb. 4, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
Crapo serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and played a key role in the passage of the budget bill. 
Crapo in an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun said that he considers the fear that many have expressed of people losing their Medicaid coverage is “inaccurate.” 
“The only way to prove this is to wait and see what actually happens,” he said. “But the bottom line is this, no one’s benefits were cut in this legislation, unless you are a person who is not an American citizen and not legally present in America.” 
He also noted that others will lose benefits if they don’t comply with new work requirements or if they were registered to receive payments from multiple states. 
 How the reconciliation bill will affect provider taxes, hospitals and health care providers

However, the bill’s limits on what are known as provider taxes — which allow states to tax hospitals to increase the amount of money in the program and therefore increase the amount the federal government matches — have left many wondering whether, with less money in the system, states will have to reduce or cut optional Medicaid benefits to balance their budgets. 
  Mel Leviton
“It gives you a bigger pot of money to draw down more, and when you reduce it, well, you’re not going to be able to draw down as much money,” said Mel Leviton, executive director of the Idaho State Independent Living Council. “I don’t see how that could not lead to cuts.”  
Idaho assesses hospitals, nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities and the amount assessed makes up the state share to draw down on federal Medicaid funding as a supplemental payment to those providers. The payment is the difference between what Medicare would have paid and what Medicaid did pay. 
In 2022, the Legislature approved a law that allowed the state to assess an additional amount from hospitals to pay for increased rates for home and community based services. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is “reviewing the bill to evaluate its impacts on Idaho,” agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun in an email.

 It’s unclear what health programs could be reduced, but some Idahoans fear the uncertainty 

Home and community based services — which allow health care workers to go into people’s homes rather than go to a residential care facility — are one of the optional services under Medicaid provided in Idaho, among many others. More than 20,000 Idahoans, including Herbert, receive some type of home and community based services, Leviton said. 
Other optional services include coverage of dental and vision care, prescription drugs, prosthetics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory care for those who rely on a ventilator, and case management. 
“It’s funny that they’re called optional benefits, because they’re not actually optional,” said Twin Falls resident Tara Rowe. 
  Tara Rowe
Rowe is enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare, but Medicaid covers her physical therapy visits that go beyond what Medicare will pay for. 
“It’s pretty much essential so I can function as a human,” Rowe said. “… it means me being mobile. It means me managing chronic pain, it’s just part of how I continue to deal with chronic illness and disability.” 
She knows first-hand what her life would look like without those services, because she has already lived through it. 
Rowe experienced her disabling event in 2008, when she was a 23-year-old graduate student. She didn’t successfully gain access to Medicaid and Medicare services until 2012. In that interim, she paid out-of-pocket for most of her services or went without.   
“I was not particularly mobile, I was not very independent,” Rowe said. “I had to rely on everyone in my life for something. I didn’t have the tools to manage pain. I didn’t have the tools to be sure that I didn’t cause more damage to my body. So I know the difference between trying to live with this and without that care, and what it is like now in the last 13 years of having care, it’s night and day.” 
In that time, she missed both her grandparents’ funerals because she wasn’t mobile enough to be able to go. 
With the services she receives now, she can live on her own without a care worker coming into her home. 
“I personally would rather feel good enough on any given day to do my own dishes rather than have someone else come and do it for me,” Rowe said. 
Moscow resident Larkin Seiler moved onto another optional Medicaid program, the self directed care service through the state’s developmental disabilities Medicaid system, when he wanted to move out of a certified family home and in with his then-girlfriend, now wife Jen Magelky-Seiler. 
Under the program, Seiler receives a budget from Medicaid to hire his own staff that come to his home and help him with the basics of living, such as hygiene, meal preparation, and transportation. The Medicaid money goes through a financial intermediary, and allows him to pay for a worker for 10 hours a day.

Seiler said the service allows him to keep his job at Alta Science & Engineering, Inc., where he has worked doing data entry for 26 years. It also keeps him and his wife together in their home, where they’ve lived 10 years. 
There are no agencies in Moscow offering the kind of in-home care that Seiler requires, he said. If he no longer had access to the program, he likely would have to go into a nursing home. 
Magelky-Seiler also has disabilities, but she said she doesn’t think she would qualify for that level of residential care under Medicaid. 
“It’s one of the things I worry most about cuts,” she said, “is losing our family, our home together.” 
 Medicaid recipients already face barriers to care in Idaho 

Idaho is facing a significant shortage of direct care workers, the type of health care providers who go into the homes of people such as Herbert and Seiler. 
Herbert previously had a need when her in-home care provider at the time went on vacation and her friend Mary Arndt stepped in to fill the position. 
“And I’ve never left, they never came back,” Arndt said. “I’ve been with Kristyn almost 20 years.” 
Arndt is 73-years-old, and said there are limitations on what she can do and how often she can come. Herbert was able to hire a couple more staff recently, but it had been a long time since anyone has applied, she said. Through Medicaid, she can pay her staff $20 an hour, which is set based on her level of care. 
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

Some of the people she has hired she later fired because they did things like stole food or otherwise tried to take advantage of Herbert. 
“She’s in a wheelchair. She’s disabled, but she’s not stupid,” Ardnt said, noting that Herbert often notices the un-professional behavior and quickly notifies her friend.  
Seiler is able to pay $17 an hour, which often doesn’t compete well with other jobs such as at McDonald’s, he and Magelky-Seiler said. 
Because there aren’t any Moscow agencies that provide care in the home, Seiler will post ads on Craigslist, put up flyers around town, and ask around through word of mouth to find staff. 
“Unfortunately, we get a lot of people who wouldn’t pass a background check,” Magelky-Seiler said. “It takes a lot of work to filter through people and make sure that they’re quality individuals that should be in our home and providing safe care.” 
Rowe said in the Twin Falls area she has a harder time finding some services that she could more easily access when she lived in Nampa. For instance, she used to be able to receive her needed steroid injections at one appointment at the Spine Institute of Idaho. At her clinic in Twin Falls, she has to schedule three separate appointments. 
She said the community only recently had counselors get certified to do eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR, therapy, which was a treatment she received 10 years ago in the Treasure Valley.

 Idaho Medicaid patients are unsure of the future of their benefits, or what to do if they get cut

Each of the three Idahoans interviewed responded “I don’t know” when asked what they will do if their services get scaled back or cut entirely, but they all said they are worried. 
“This is something I’ve been thinking and dealing with a lot recently,” Rowe said. 
She said she knows her PT would get cut in about half and she could absorb smaller costs, such as her glasses, but things like pharmaceuticals may be too much. 
Seiler said “I don’t really know what would happen” and his wife responded, “It would be really hard to live your life. You’re already living with the bare minimum.”  
If the people utilizing home and community based services had to go into nursing homes, there wouldn’t be enough beds, said Leviton of the Independent Living Council. The nursing facility coverage is a mandatory benefit under Medicaid, but there are only about 6,000 beds statewide. 
“Where are you going to put these 20,000 people?” Leviton asked. 
Herbert said she would refuse to go to a nursing home, where she couldn’t take her beloved emotional support cat, whose full name is Destiny Angelle Herbert, and where she believes she wouldn’t receive as much care. 
She said she tried to meet with Idaho’s congressional delegation to urge them to oppose the cuts, but had little luck reaching them. 
“I wish they could be in my shoes,” she said of the congressmen. 
She said of President Donald Trump, whose major policy agenda was largely fulfilled in the legislation, “Maybe I should ask him if I can move in.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/For Utah News Dispatch)I can’t figure out which character Ryan Walters is playing. 
Is he the kid who sits in the back of the classroom, quietly sowing chaos by chunking nasty spitballs at his classmates and blaming someone else when he gets in trouble? 
Or is Oklahoma’s Republican state superintendent merely a well-intentioned but bumbling public official who hasn’t got a clue about how things actually work?
Those seem to be the simplest explanations behind Walters’ bizarre, ill-timed and unfunded attempt to require public schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students or face sanctions. Walters expects districts to pay for this using their existing budgets that are already feeling the pinch from the Trump administration’s decision to freeze upward of $70 million in planned funding.
State law also does not require districts to fund universal free meals. Lawmakers leave that decision to local school boards that set the budgets and spending priorities.
The idea of ensuring all students have free lunches is laudable on the surface. After all, state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have filed various pieces of legislation in recent years that seeks to expand access to free meals. Supporters say it could help boost lagging outcomes because children can’t learn efficiently with hungry stomachs.
The problem is Walters’ approach is so inept that it makes you wonder if he doesn’t really want this to work. Maybe he just wants everyone around him to squirm so he can ultimately throw up his hands in feigned disgust and say: “I tried, but those evil, no good, woke school administrators and those liberal Republicans in the state Legislature stopped us from keeping more of your hard earned money in your pocket.”
Or something equally ridiculous. 
Walters, after all, is reportedly eyeing a gubernatorial bid in 2026, judging from ryanwaltersforgovernor.com, which says it is “launching soon.”
But if he truly wants this to happen, he’s signaling that he’s incompetent and not ready for the big time.
It’s no secret that the state and districts operate on a July 1 through June 30 fiscal cycle. Both have their annual budgets set by the end of June every year. Yet Walters waited until July 7 to announce his edict — days after the deadline had passed for eligible districts to apply to participate in a federal meal reimbursement program, and weeks after the Legislature determined its annual public school funding priorities. Universal free school lunches were not one.
Walters apparently has no idea — nor a care for — what providing free lunches is going to cost. He’s insistent that districts have enough existing money to pay for it through things like reduced administrative costs. That argument conveniently ignores that little pesky state law that limits administrative spending to no more than 5% of yearly spending. Some district leaders have said even if they eliminate all administrative jobs, they’ll still be short of needed funding and will have to increase class sizes and eliminate teachers.
Walters’ elected position leading our state’s public educational system affords him the opportunity before every legislative session to outline his priorities and ask for funding. What did he choose this year? Issues like Bibles and guns, not universal school meals. 
If this was such a big deal, why not prioritize it then?
And for a guy who screams until he’s red in the face about administrative bloat, Walters has plenty of that in his own backyard. Don’t forget that he paid out nearly $600,000 in end-of-year bonuses to his state education department staff last year. Just imagine how many lunches that money could have bought.  
The unfortunate thing is that families are struggling with inflation and seemingly endless rising food costs. Meanwhile, companies contracted with school districts profit from being able to slap on unnecessary fees to our children’s lunch tabs. 
My kids don’t qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, but sometimes they want to eat pizza, chicken nuggets and mashed potatoes, and frito chili pie, so we fork out $3.80 per lunch. School meal costs are typically set by local boards and vary by district, but the School Nutrition Association reported typical lunch prices ranged from $2.95 to $3.20 last school year depending on age. Those might seem like a small pittance, but over time it adds up, so we limit how often they can eat cafeteria food.
As a parent, I found myself irked last year when my children’s district capped the amount of money parents could contribute to their meal account at $100 per transaction while at the same time allowing their vendor to charge a several dollar “transaction fee” each time I added money. That cap meant families with multiple children paid more in fees because they had to make more frequent contributions. I was so irritated I called the district and the vendor and emailed my local school board member to complain.
I thought it was a reasonable request to put more money into their lunch accounts so I could pay less in transaction fees.
To his credit, my elected official responded swiftly and told me that my frustration is one that his family has experienced also. He was told the vendor would raise the fee for everyone if the dollar limit is increased.
The school district ultimately told me I could avoid the fee by writing a check in whatever amount I wanted to the school cafeteria, which is what I’ve done since.
Judging by the bipartisan groundswell of support for Walters’ plan on social media, families want lawmakers to help lessen the burden of school meal costs, and Republican legislators’ days of ignoring the issue are at an end. Their constituents want them to take action.
The right way – and not cheap shots for political gain.
That means going through the legislative process and allocating money to pay for it, not expecting districts to eat the costs or slashing funding in other areas.
What we don’t need is Walters hurling spitballs like a class clown who damages local schools and children’s education. 
One thing is clear: Getting this plan across the finish line will require someone who has the motivation to see this through.
Walters started this food fight. Now voters will see if he has the leadership skills to finish it.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate districts by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seatsand 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.


In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.


In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.


In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.

Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

Silver Stream Farm sits on a windy rim at nearly 8,000 feet. By tapping into advanced indoor technology, it grows climate-controlled crops of berries, tomatoes and vegetables. 
The post Year-round strawberries in Wyoming? Welcome to Pinedale’s indoor farm. appeared first on WyoFile .","SUBLETTE COUNTY—None of the traditional trappings of farm life greet visitors to this windy rim north of Pinedale. 
No crops waving in field rows, no sounds of cows lowing, no odors of animal manure lacing the air, no mud to wipe off your boots. 
That’s because this operation is far from traditional. Silver Stream Farm is located entirely within five large grow houses tucked off Highway 191. Inside the buildings, the farm utilizes 25,000 square feet of space rigged with high-tech sensors, overhead misters, climate controls and nutrient pumps to grow an abundance of produce unexpected for this harsh corner of Wyoming. 
Zucchini plants dangle from the ceiling and dark-green basil grows in hydroponic pods. Kale leaves unfurl in dense patches, arugula seedlings sprout in trays and an entire 5,000-square-foot grow house is dedicated to strawberries. In there, rows and rows of the fragaria plants produce the distinctive white flowers and red berries. 
And because they are protected from harsh temperatures and fed by grow lights, the berries, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and other crops are in rotation year-round.
Silver Stream Farm, which rebranded this spring following a fivefold expansion, aims to supplement local production for communities in a corner of the state where most food is trucked in from long distances.

“The goal is to create just a really robust local food system,” said Chief Operating Officer Nicci Hammerel, by touching “as many households as we can.”
The farm may not have the capacity to feed the entire region. But what it does possess is exemplified by what Hammerel offers next. “Try one,” she said, holding out a container of cherry tomatoes, ripe and ready to eat on an early summer day when many outdoor tomato plants in Wyoming have yet to even produce flowers. 
High-tech agriculture
Farms aren’t known for their cleanliness. They rely on dirt, after all, and dirt is, well, dirty. But there’s also a quality of unruliness inherent to many small farms, with encroaching weeds and plants gone to seed, chickens pecking around a yard or green matter shoveled into compost piles. 
Inside the grow houses of Silver Stream Farm, however, plants grow in orderly rows, floors are spotless and equipment is almost clinically clean.
“I want to be able to eat off the floor,” farm manager LeeAnn Shelton joked. She had just taken a break from pruning strawberries — methodically trimming off smaller buds to encourage the plants to grow fewer, bigger berries.

The tidiness is something she and her husband, Cooper Shelton, have been dialing in since the project launched four years ago.  
Shelton grew up in a farming family in North Carolina. She and Cooper, who is also from North Carolina, moved to the Jackson area for the outdoor amenities in 2018. They both worked in hospitality, though they missed the gardening traditions they had grown up with. 
They became involved with Silver Stream around 2021 when the farm’s original owner, entrepreneur and philanthropist Dakin Sloss, asked if they were interested in a garden project. Sloss wanted to do something about the local food desert in northern Sublette County.
The project started with a single grow house and a much longer name — Satchitananda Farm. In the early days, LeeAnn mostly tended the plants while Cooper, who attended college for engineering, focused on dialing in the technologies. 
“We were plant people, and we became systems people,” she said, noting that several years in, it’s become “a heck of a garden project.”
They sold vegetables to their first customers in 2022, and have been refining their methods since. 
Sensors, pipes and gauges help feed and water the indoor crops at Silver Stream Farm near Pinedale. (Katie Klingsporn/WyoFile) 
A computerized system monitors and pampers the crops. Sensors gauge the hydroponic plants, and pump the right mix of nutrients and fertilizer into the irrigation water to feed them. Water recirculates from misters above to drains beneath the plants. Climate-controlled buildings meet the temperature and humidity preferences of the crops in them. The well water is even brought to room temperature so as not to shock the plants. 
“It’s pretty advanced,” Hammerel said. 
The operation isn’t entirely divorced from nature; employees introduce insects like ladybugs and wasps to help with pests and pollination. 
Until this spring, however, the husband-and-wife team operated out of a single greenhouse. Growing a variety of crops all in the same climate zone comes with challenges. Melons, for example, thrive in different conditions than kale. 
The expansion 
These types of indoor agriculture projects are typically done on a larger scale and in friendlier climates, Shelton said. The original Pinedale operation was unique in its size and surrounding conditions. 
“We’ve seen it be negative 45 [degrees], and we’ve seen it be 95 [degrees],” she said. “We’ve kind of just tried to baby this building along.” 
By experimenting and perfecting, the Sheltons established a proof of concept, Hammerel said. So this spring, the farm added four new grow houses. It was a huge investment that quintupled the farm’s capacity and allowed the growers to divide their crops into five distinct zones. The farm also hired five new employees to work alongside the Sheltons.

The growth has allowed them to improve even more, Shelton said, by setting each climate to match the plants it grows. “It’s really been awesome to just see everything booming.”
Crops range from traditional market produce like lettuce, fennel, cabbage, broccoli, squash, herbs, melons, edible flowers and carrots. The farm also experiments with more exotic varieties, like ginger and mangos.
On the business side, the newly rebranded farm is focused on recalibrating based on its new capacity, Hammerel and Shelton said. 
“Our client base is expanding and expanding and changing, so learning from them what they like, what they want,” Shelton said. 
The overarching goal is to get fresh, local food into as many households as possible. Food retains both flavor and nutrition better when it doesn’t need to be shipped thousands of miles, Hammerel said. 
Silver Stream has more than 70 subscribers to its Community Supported Agriculture service — a model where customers pay in advance for weekly boxes of produce. The farm also sells at farmers markets in Jackson and Bondurant, Hungry Jack’s General Store in Wilson and a few restaurants. Customers can order produce online and pick it up in regional locations.

Silver Stream was one of two Wyoming farms to win a 2025 pilot grant from Wyoming’s Department of Family Services and Food Works Group aimed at strengthening food production and access. The $39,000 grant subsidizes the cost of the fresh produce Silver Stream grows for regional food banks. 
The farm also intended to participate in the Wyoming Farm to School program — but the program will not continue past its current cycle due to federal cuts. 
House grown
Back in the main house, staffers fill boxes for CSA orders and plant seeds for the next cycle of microgreens. Around noon, they break for lunch — one of the regular potluck-style meals they share. 
On the menu today: burgers made with beef from a neighboring ranch alongside a cucumber and tomato salad. Topping the burgers are thickly sliced heirloom tomatoes, lettuce and sweet pickles one of the employees made. 
All the veggies are, of course, courtesy of the grow houses.

If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Pete Ricketts has joined the likes of Ted Turner and Bill Gates as a well-heeled businessman buying large plots of land in Nebraska.
Like those purchases, there’s concern it might result in higher property taxes for neighbors, though a Dawes County commissioner calls those concerns unfounded.
Ricketts, whose net worth is estimated at $182 million by the investment research website Quiver Qualitative, bought nearly 3,459 acres in the scenic Pine Ridge area of northwest Nebraska in December for $7.45 million.

The purchase, which averaged $2,154 per acre, involved two groups of land once owned by a Wahoo businessman, Dan Kreitman, whom Ricketts had appointed to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission in 2016. One parcel is just east of Chadron State Park. The second is just west of East Ash Road.
Both parcels are in the scenic Pine Ridge area of Nebraska, south and southwest of Chadron in Dawes County. It is rugged canyon land known for strong populations of deer and turkey, and even some elk and mountain lions. Part of the land the senator purchased was burned during wildfires over the past 20 years, leaving behind lots of blackened trees and newly restored grassland.
Ricketts, who enjoys turkey and deer hunting, purchased the land for recreational purposes, according to a realtor with knowledge of the sale. His father, Joe, raises bison on land he owns. There was no indication that Pete will be raising livestock on the new land.
Messages sent to Ricketts’ senate office seeking comment did not result in a response by Friday.

While past purchases of Nebraska ranch land by Turner, the founder of CNN, and acquisition of farmland by Gates, the Microsoft billionaire, raised the ire of some nearby landowners, a former Chadron radio news director said feelings might be different with Ricketts’ purchase because he’s from Nebraska and is a former governor.
“He’s not an outsider,” said John Axtell, a longtime Chadron-area radio news and sports reporter who is now retired.
Dawes County Commissioner Jake Stewart, who owns Pine Ridge ranch property not far from the Ricketts land, said the purchase is considered a “private sale” — one not used to set property values for nearby land — that should not impact property valuations and property taxes for neighbors.
The price paid by Ricketts, $2,154 per acre, is higher than the average price for all property in northwest Nebraska of $965 an acre, according to a report this year by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Center for Agriculture Profitability. The average price paid for non-tillable grazing land, which is most of what Ricketts bought, was $630 an acre.
But the price for so-called “recreational land” that provides a private hunting preserve can go much higher. Current listings for such property in the Pine Ridge can leap above $4,000 — to as high as $12,000 an acre.

Ricketts, when governor, proclaimed that Nebraska was the “best destination in the United States” for turkey hunting. Besides that, he posted photographs of deer hunts, and the Pine Ridge is known for its ample populations of mule deer and wild turkeys.
“Land in the Pine Ridge is prized by big-game hunters, regardless of whether they’re rich or poor,” said a veteran western Nebraska realtor, who asked not to be named to avoid upsetting clients. “It’s one of the last wild places in the United States.”
There also are likely some mountain lions on Ricketts’ land. In 2020, the Lincoln Journal Star wrote a story about Kreitman shooting a deer on his Pine Ridge ranch land, but when he located the animal, a mountain lion had already begun feeding on it.
Gates, according to a Flatwater Free Press story in 2024, owns 20,000 acres of farmland across 19 counties in Nebraska. But most of Gates’ holdings are tillable farmland in eastern Nebraska, not rocky outcroppings in the Pine Ridge.
In 2018, the Omaha World-Herald reported that Turner owned approximately 500,000 acres of ranch land, mostly in the Sand Hills region of the state, where he raises bison.
John Malone, who made billions in running telecom companies including Liberty Media, also is a major owner of Nebraska property, according to the realtor interviewed by the Examiner.
So, said Axtell, the former radio reporter, Ricketts’ purchase in the Pine Ridge area pales by comparison.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)At least a quarter of hospitals in seven states closed their obstetric services between 2010 and 2022, according to a new study in the journal Health Affairs. And in six states, more than 60% of hospitals lacked obstetrics by 2022.
Using data from the American Hospital Association and federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the researchers analyzed obstetric services, which is the branch of medicine focused on pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, at short-term acute care hospitals between 2010 and 2022.
The study included 4,964 hospitals.
Rural states saw the most profound losses. The states with the highest percentage of all hospitals lacking obstetrics by 2022 were: North Dakota (73%), Oklahoma (63%), West Virginia (62%), Louisiana (60%), South Dakota (60%) and Mississippi (60%).
Idaho banned abortion. Three years later, minors and seniors struggle to get routine care.

 
The study sheds further light on the nation’s growing maternity health care deserts. At 18.6 per 100,000 live births, the U.S. has a maternal mortality rate far higher than other high-income nations. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 80% of maternal deaths in the U.S. are preventable.
The “steady march of closures” has been an ongoing problem, said Katy Kozhimannil, University of Minnesota professor and lead author of the study.
Hospital leaders and experts have warned that Congress’ Medicaid cuts could have a ripple effect, leading to many hospitals no longer able to afford their labor and delivery units, which are expensive to maintain.

“Those programs are a primary source of support for maternity care,” Kozhimannil said. “Without changes to maternity care financing and organization, I expect that the trends that we have seen over the past couple of decades will likely continue.”
A dozen states saw a quarter or more losses of obstetric services among hospitals in rural counties, the study found.
Across rural counties in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, close to half of hospitals — 46% — lost obstetrics between 2010 and 2022.
Those two states saw the highest percentage of hospitals losing obstetrics, followed by West Virginia (about 43%), Florida (40%) and Iowa (nearly 40%).

Along with Washington, D.C., urban counties in four states — Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma  and Rhode Island — saw at least a quarter of hospitals lose obstetrics.
By 2022, two-thirds of rural hospitals in eight states (Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia) were without obstetric services.
Three states — Delaware, Utah and Vermont — had no obstetric losses between 2010 and 2022, the authors wrote.

(Photo courtesy of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting)Efforts to rescind $1.1 billion previously approved by Congress for public media could have a devastating effect on a decades-old Arkansas film festival, according to its executive director. 
Now in its 34th year, the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival is the longest-running documentary film festival in North America and one of two film festivals that could lose funding if federal lawmakers approve a rescissions request from President Donald Trump that would claw back federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. 
Ken Jacobson, executive director of the Hot Springs Documentary Film Institute, said the cuts would affect the nine-day festival as a whole, but its Filmmaker Forum, now in its third year, “would be devastated” because the program receives the majority of its funding from a $160,000 CPB grant. 
Brad Burleson debuted his first short film at the festival last year and called the forum “a game changer” that has “completely shaped” his journey. The Hot Springs filmmaker and festival board member said the forum is an affordable way to connect local filmmakers to the broader documentary community without the expense of traveling to larger coastal cities. 
Through the forum’s 15-minute one-on-one meetings with industry professionals, Burleson met CPB and National Endowment for the Arts representatives who shared information about resources and advice on how to market his film, Tippi & Barb. 
The 12-minute documentary tells the story of how state Rep. Tippi McCullough, a retired teacher and Arkansas’ only openly gay state lawmaker, was fired from a Catholic school for marrying her wife.

In addition to its $160,000 CPB grant, the Hot Springs festival gets $20,000 from PBS, which also receives CPB funding, Jacobson said. The combined amount represents about 29% of the festival’s nearly $650,000 annual operating budget.
In fiscal year 2024, Arkansas received nearly $3.2 million in CPB funding, according to CPB’s budget request. Arkansas PBS received nearly $2.5 million, and roughly $545,300 was split between three National Public Radio stations. 
Cuts to these institutions could also affect the festival because of partnerships between them, Jacobson said. Little Rock Public Radio helps promote the festival, while Arkansas PBS works with the nonprofit on an emerging filmmakers program.
“The cutting of CPB funding, it doesn’t just turn off PBS, it turns off a pipeline for storytellers,” Burleson said. 
Rescissions Act
The CPB cuts are part of the larger Recissions Act of 2025 that would revoke $9.4 billion in previously approved funding for public media and foreign aid programs. The U.S. House approved the measure by two votes in June, marking only the third time in decades that the House has voted to claw back funding that lawmakers had already agreed to spend. 
The U.S. Senate must vote on the rescissions request by Friday for it to take effect. 
Jacobson shared his concerns about the bill with 4th District Congressman Rep. Bruce Westerman, who represents Hot Springs. Two weeks after all four of Arkansas’ representatives voted for the measure, Westerman said in a letter to Jacobson that although Arkansas PBS receives about 11% of its funding from CPB, the loss of those funds shouldn’t threaten the state’s public broadcasting services because of its diversified funding model. 
“There’s no easy or feel-good answer here. I believe there are other federal programs more appropriate for reductions than CPB,” Westerman wrote. “That said, our nation’s fiscal path is unsustainable, and serious steps must be taken to rein in spending. Please know, I will keep your thoughts in mind should any future legislation regarding the CPB come to the House Floor.”
Although Jacobson found Westerman’s reluctance encouraging, he said “we need our representatives to step up and act accordingly” unless they want to see negative impacts in Arkansas.
Like Arkansas PBS, the documentary festival has a diverse revenue stream that includes ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, individual donations and grants from other organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts, which Trump recommended eliminating in his 2026 Discretionary Budget Request. The NEA has also cancelled grants this year to various groups.










The amount of culture and the types of films that are brought into Hot Springs, this doesn’t exist. This is such an anomaly to have such great talent, to have so many diverse films that range the spectrum brought into our little town in the South.


– Hot Springs filmmaker Brad Burleson


The Hot Springs Film Festival received a termination letter for a $40,000 NEA grant awarded in late 2024. The nonprofit eventually received the full amount, but Jacobson said others weren’t so lucky. 
The Trump administration’s threats to grant funding have been “upsetting” because organizations go through a long process of applications and vetting to earn these grants — they’re not just automatically given, he said.
“It seems like it should have been a done deal. So then to hear in January that the administration was planning to cancel the vast majority of those grants, it is kind of a slap in the face not just to organizations like ours, but to the process itself,” Jacobson said. 
The elimination of federal funding can have a ripple effect because several grant-funded organizations work together.
Burleson, for example, honed his filmmaking skills by taking classes offered by Low Key Arts, which were funded by NEA and the Arkansas Arts Council. The nonprofit partnered with the film festival last year to offer a documentary workshop, which allowed Burleson to create his first film.

There’s a lot of momentum in Arkansas filmmaking that’s driven by access to resources like the Filmmaker’s Forum, and losing federal funds diminishes that growth, Burleson said. 
“This isn’t just about art,” he said. “In so many people’s minds this is an extracurricular activity, [but] this is something that teaches people how to tell Southern stories and really promotes the Southern storytelling.”
Since attending the festival for the first time in 2010, Burleson said he’s “gone religiously,” often taking off work for the entire week to attend what he considers a unique event. 
“The amount of culture and the types of films that are brought into Hot Springs, this doesn’t exist,” Burleson said. “This is such an anomaly to have such great talent, to have so many diverse films that range the spectrum brought into our little town in the South.”
Beyond making documentaries accessible to local audiences and filmmakers, Jacobson said the festival is a boon for the local economy because guests stay at hotels and patronize local businesses. 
“All of that economic engine will be stalled if this much valued arts organization is forced to cut back,” he said. 
Jacobson said he’s started thinking about how he might cope with potential cuts next year by shortening the nine-day festival, eliminating programs or reducing travel budgets for high-profile guests. 
For now, staff is busy preparing for this year’s festival, which is scheduled for Oct. 10-18. More information is available at www.hsdfi.org.

Every other Sunday from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., Raquel Lane-Arellano waits for calls from people across Colorado who may have spotted Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. She has been volunteering for six years, but the first time her phone rang was in January. Now, for those 12 hours twice a month, the ringing rarely stops. 
Once she gets a call, Lane-Arellano confirms the location with the often shaky voice on the other end of the phone. Then she notifies other volunteers, who drive out to the area. Their job is to determine whether the sighting is legitimate, document the scene, speak to locals and hand out “Know Your Rights” cards, but not to physically confront the agents.
Lane-Arellano volunteers as a dispatcher for a 24/7 hotline run by the Colorado Rapid Response Network, a coalition of immigration, religious and legal nonprofits. The network was founded in 2017 to document reported ICE sightings and has amassed about 3,000 volunteers across the state, according to organizers.
“The purpose is to make sure people have the facts and that we try to dissuade some fear,” said Lane-Arellano, who is also the communications manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. “Because what the Trump administration wants is for our people to be afraid all the time.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The network’s member organizations include the ACLU Colorado, American Friends Service Committee, Mi Familia Vota and Together Colorado. The statewide hotline is the first of its kind in Colorado, and it also covers southern Wyoming, according to organizers. Its operations are similar to statewide ICE reporting hotlines in Oregon, Connecticut and New Jersey, as well as local hotlines in cities like Los Angeles and Detroit. 
The Rapid Response Network has seen both hotline calls and volunteer interest skyrocket since President Donald Trump took office for his second term, due to an uptick in immigration enforcement. Colorado is a particular focus of Trump’s push for mass deportations, and he has singled out Aurora for enforcement operations.
Between Trump’s inauguration and mid-June, ICE arrests in Colorado have nearly quadrupled compared to the same period last year, according to ICE data obtained by UC Berkeley researchers. The researchers found that 1,360 people have been arrested by ICE in Colorado under the second Trump administration, and many have no criminal record. The Colorado ICE data shows more than 400 arrested people marked as “other immigration violator,” as opposed to “convicted criminal” or “pending criminal charges.”
One of those arrests was of prominent immigrant rights advocate Jeanette Vizguerra, who has lived in the U.S. since 1997 and is currently in ICE detention. Her lawyers have alleged in federal court that her arrest was in retaliation for protected speech.
The administration’s immigration crackdown received a major funding boost through the Republican tax break and spending cut bill that Trump signed earlier this month. The bill devotes $170 billion to border security, immigration enforcement and the hiring of thousands more ICE agents, among other Trump priorities. 
Network at odds with ICE
The Rapid Response Network calls its volunteers who approach and document areas with a reported ICE presence “confirmers.” These volunteers undergo a confirmer training. The network advises noncitizens against becoming confirmers due to the risks of entering areas where ICE might be conducting raids. 
Andrea Loya serves as the director of the immigrant support nonprofit Casa De Paz, but outside of work she also volunteers as a confirmer. In her six months volunteering, she has gone out more than 10 times, and she said each situation is unique.
Each time she gets a call from a dispatcher, she grabs a megaphone, flyers with immigrant rights information and her phone. During her outings, she remains in frequent communication with other network volunteers to ensure they know she is safe, and so they can post social media updates about whether ICE is in fact present at the reported location. Loya said she has never spoken to ICE agents, and she keeps her distance while around them.
Loya characterized the role of the network as that of a neighborhood watch group: to document unwanted activities and inform residents.
“It’s important for us to counter the narrative that what we’re doing is illegal,” Loya said. “It’s just a neighborhood watch, the kind of thing people have been doing for years. When you enter really nice neighborhoods and park there, people come up and ask you what you’re doing. That’s what we’re doing, but in our communities.”










It’s just a neighborhood watch, the kind of thing people have been doing for years. When you enter really nice neighborhoods and park there, people come up and ask you what you’re doing. That’s what we’re doing, but in our communities.


– Andrea Loya, Colorado Rapid Response Network volunteer


The Department of Homeland Security and ICE’s Denver field office have condemned the network for allegedly interfering with immigration enforcement operations. Representatives of the Denver field office declined an interview request for this story.
“Groups like this interfere with ICE’s ability to keep communities safe,” the Denver field office said in a statement.
The Denver field office said that it conducted an operation in Longmont on June 20 to apprehend a child rapist, adding that it was disrupted by Rapid Response Network members. 
ICE Denver declined to specify the way in which the Rapid Response Network interfered, and did not comment on whether there were any physical or verbal altercations between agents and network volunteers. ICE said on social media that the raid targeted a man from El Salvador who is wanted in Italy but has provided no warrant or other evidence to show that the raid was indeed focused on that man, or that he was in Longmont.
In a June 25 statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the network and its members “disrupt ICE operations targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens.”
Jennifer Piper, a longtime leader in the Rapid Response Network, was dispatching calls on June 20. She said a group of volunteer confirmers drove to the Longmont location and talked to community members about their rights but did not confront or otherwise interfere with ICE. 
“This (incident) invited hundreds of people to try to troll our hotline, which was unsuccessful,” Piper said. “But this is an administration that has put out a bunch of misinformation and propaganda. We are just trying to get the best information possible out to our community.”
Combating fear
Lane-Arellano said that documenting instances when ICE isn’t present in a community is just as important as documenting when immigration agents are present. That’s because fear has permeated throughout Colorado immigrant communities, and it’s crucial to help her neighbors regain a level of security, she said. 
Every white van or law enforcement uniform can signal potential ICE presence to people who fear deportation, especially due to ICE tactics of using unmarked vehicles and arresting many non-criminals, she added.
“We show people what’s actually happening, and I think that’s really valuable so that there’s not needless fear,” Lane-Arellano said. “(ICE is) trying to silence that kind of work, and they want to criminalize that kind of work. I think people should be really concerned when there’s a government entity that’s just never held accountable, and is trying to minimize their public scrutiny.”

Some of the network’s volunteers attended a July 7 protest calling for closure of the ICE detention center is Aurora, which is operated by private prison firm GEO Group. Vizguerra has been detained there for four months.
Vizguerra’s daughter, Luna Báez, joined demonstrators. While protests and social media posts bring attention to the plight of detainees, Báez said allies of immigrants should also focus on other supportive steps — such as donating to nonprofits, providing translation services and volunteering with the Rapid Response Network. 
“It’s all about direct action,” Báez said. “You have to get uncomfortable to dismantle these systems of oppression.”
Denver resident Deb Schaffer attended the protest and also volunteers as a confirmer with the network. So far, she has gone out on about eight calls. 
“It’s a way to support people in the immigrant community and have a way to be helpful, and it’s a way to be someone that’s proud to live in Colorado,” Schaffer said. “We’re doing that together.”
Volunteering with the network can take a mental health toll, because of how intense and heartbreaking the calls can be, Lane-Arellano said. She remembers a 7 a.m. call she received from a Denver-area preschool principal who was concerned about ICE nearby and who said parents were too afraid to exit their cars with their children. 
The network sent out a confirmer who verified that the sighting was actually a local law enforcement agency, and the confirmation that it was a false alarm helped the preschool return to normal. 
But that call, and those terrified parents and kids, have stuck with Lane-Arellano. 
“It can be painful, but I do it anyway because of the goodness of everyday people,” Lane-Arellano said. “When it feels like there’s so much hate and cruelty at the federal level, it helps knowing that this isn’t what we stand for, and knowing that there’s so many people who are willing to put their own person on the line to support our community.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)One month after Nashville officials turned over a trove of documents to two Congressional committees probing the mayor’s response to immigration raids, the workings of the federal investigations remain opaque.
Representatives of Republicans on the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, including Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles, have declined or ignored requests for updates and information. 
A spokesperson for the Homeland Security Committee’s Democratic members said he was unaware of any ongoing investigation. “Democrats are not participating alongside Republicans,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Mayor Freddie O’Connell has made no changes to a policy requiring the prompt reporting of all interactions between city employees and immigration officials that initially drew Republican ire.
“Departments continue to timely report information in compliance with the EO,” said Alex Apple, a spokesperson, citing a standing executive order. 
Congressional committees demand records from Nashville mayor on immigration enforcement

Thus far, the city has turned over about 100 documents in response to the probe. About half are terse narrative descriptions of contacts with the city initiated by Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, or ICE, and U.S. Homeland Security officials this year that have already been publicly posted, a review of records sent to Congress by the Lookout found. 
Other documents include emails describing the mayor’s policy requiring reporting of these interactions.
An additional seven interactions between city officials and federal immigration authorities have taken place since the last public release of information, Apple said. 
Four occurred in late June and three occurred last week, he said. They have yet to be made public as city officials go through a redaction process to remove individual identifying information, he said.
Nashville raids prompt scrutiny of mayor’s response
Scrutiny of Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell by Ogles and members of the Trump Administration began in the weeks after the Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE collaborated to conduct immigration stops over two days in May in South Nashville, a bustling neighborhood that is home to many in the city’s diverse immigrant communities. 
The raids took city officials by surprise, and they prompted immediate questions from local advocates and city council members about whether Nashville police or other officials had also cooperated. 
The mayor’s office denied any cooperation in the effort, which swept up 196 of the city’s immigrant residents in what federal officials described as a “targeted enforcement operation. Of the individuals arrested, 96 had prior criminal convictions and 31 had reentered the U.S. illegally after being deported, a press release from ICE said. 
In response to the raids, O’Connell updated a longstanding executive order issued by a predecessor requiring the city’s emergency and nonemergency personnel to report interactions with federal immigration officials. 
Emergency officials, including police, fire, emergency management and emergency communications, now must report such contacts within 24 hours, instead of three days. 
O’Connell also publicized a “belonging fund” established in a partnership between the city and the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee to offer emergency aid to immigrants, including those left behind after a loved one’s detention by ICE.

“What’s clear today is that people who do not share our values of safety and community have the authority to cause deep community harm,” O’Connell said of the raids. 
O’Connell’s stance drew immediate pushback. Ogles, who represents a portion of Nashville, announced twin investigations by the Congressional Homeland Security and Judiciary committees into whether O’Connell’s actions obstructed the work of immigration officials. 
White House border czar Tom Homan pledged to “flood the zone” with additional immigration raids in Nashville in retaliation, saying O’Connell is “not going to stop us.”
“It certainly looks like Mayor O’Connell was involved in some sort of obstruction or the harboring of criminal illegal aliens in the great city of Nashville,” Tricia McLaughlin said in a media interview posted on the official X account of the Department of Homeland Security.
Trump administration officials accused O’Connell of “doxing” federal agents in publishing several of their names in its publicly-posted list of interactions with ICE. 
O’Connell has said the public posting of public officials’ names was inadvertent and his office has since redacted them.
O’Connell’s actions in ordering reports of ICE activity “does not interfere with federal law enforcement operations,” read a June 13 letter from attorneys for the mayor’s office to the chairs of House Homeland Security and Judiciary committees.
“It does not prohibit Metro employees from speaking with federal immigration officials; nor does it put any conditions on these communications other than requiring Metro employees report communication,” the letter said.

Patrick Morrisey has not backed down from his January executive order loosening the state’s strong school vaccine laws by allowing religious and philosophical exemptions for the shots. 
At a news conference last month, Morrisey said his administration is not aware of “one shred of evidence” that the state allowing religious exemptions would have negative consequences on residents’ health. 
“We’re not aware of one shred of evidence that by moving to be a state that respects religious liberty and exemption, that there is any negative public health effect,” Morrisey said June 24. “I dare the other side to provide that. They’re misleading you. We’re going to tell the truth.”
The executive order is based on the 2023 “Equal Protection for Religion Act.” Lawmakers this year voted down Senate Bill 460, which would have set the religious exemptions in state code. Morrisey maintains that the religious freedom law should give families the freedom not to vaccinate their kids if they choose to; he says his January executive order is merely an interpretation of that law.
Morrisey told a reporter that statistics show that in states that allow religious exemptions, the number of people who get religious exemptions for vaccines is not big enough to affect herd immunity, the resistance to infectious disease a community with a high rate of vaccination has. 
But public health experts, including one of the state’s former health officers, disagree with the governor’s assertion. They say areas with looser school vaccine laws are more likely to have disease outbreaks.
“There is overwhelming evidence that vaccine exemption policies reduce vaccination coverage rates and increase the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases,” Richard Hughes, a George Washington University law professor and vaccine law expert, wrote in a statement to West Virginia Watch. He said Morrisey’s claim disregards “decades of public health research.”
Hughes pointed to a 2010 medical study in California that found that areas of high non-medical exemptions were 2.5 times more likely to have outbreaks of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, than those with lower non-medical exemptions.
Another analysis estimated that a state with easier nonmedical vaccine exemption procedures is nearly twice as likely to experience a measles outbreak compared with states with more difficult exemption policies.
“The public health evidence is clear: well-designed vaccine exemption policies can help protect child health by maintaining high immunization coverage, preventing outbreaks, and protecting vulnerable children who cannot be vaccinated for valid medical reasons,” Hughes said. 
“This is not just about religious liberty. It’s about whether one official can unilaterally weaken a system that has long protected the health of all children in the state,” Hughes said. 
West Virginia currently does not have a health officer. State Secretary of Health Arvin Singh appeared at the governor’s news conference and spoke in support of religious exemptions. Singh said that the executive order “ensures that people of faith are not punished for making personal, prayerful decisions about their children’s health.”
Singh, who has a Master of Science in health care leadership and a master’s degree in public health, said there’s not “meaningful evidence,” religious exemptions have led to an increase in disease incidence at the population level. 
He pointed to Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania as states that maintain 90% rates for school vaccinations while allowing religious exemptions. 
Data from the Ohio Department of Health indicate that 86% of kindergarten kids got all their required shots in the 2023-2024 school year. In Florida, that number was 88% in the 2023 school year. Pennsylvania kindergarteners had a 94% vaccination rate for measles during the 2024-2025 school year.
A spokeswoman for the state Department of Health said Singh was referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s elementary school data and clarified that he meant that Ohio and Florida were “nearly at the 90% immunization rate threshold.”
“West Virginia is a beautiful state filled with hard-working families who love their children, live their values and seek to do what’s right,” Singh said. “We should not be one of the only five states still denying parents their God-given right to make decisions of conscience.”
More than 140 non-medical exemptions approved so far 
All states require school students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow religious or philosophical exemptions to those vaccines. 
As of last month, the state Department of Health said it had processed 140 religious exemptions for the 2025-2026 school year under Morrisey’s executive order. At 140, the number of exemptions would still be a tiny fraction of the total number of school age children in the state, estimated at more than 250,000.
By contrast, there were 53 requests for medical exemptions to school vaccine requirements made in 2023 — and only nine of those resulted in a permanent exemption. 
Dr. Steven Eshenaur, health officer and executive director of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department, said Morrisey’s belief that non-medical exemptions will not affect the state’s herd immunity is just an assumption. He and other experts have pointed to the state’s low rate for preschool vaccinations as evidence that many parents wouldn’t have their children vaccinated unless they’re required to. 
According to 2021 data, the state has some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country for children who are below school age. That year, about 57% of West Virginia three-year-olds got all of the recommended vaccinations. In 2023, 74% of West Virginia’s young children were vaccinated, according to KFF.
However, 98% of the state’s kindergarten children were vaccinated for measles during the 2023-2024 school year — higher than the national average of about 93%. Health experts say the state’s school vaccination laws are the reason for the higher rate of kindergarten vaccination. 
“West Virginia has one of the lowest preschool immunization rates in the country,” Eshenaur said. “If those parents don’t have to immunize their children [to enter kindergarten], we would be looking at a very large percentage of our children that are unimmunized or under immunized going into school.
“The assumption is that they will get immunized,” Eshenaur said. “The reality is that parents aren’t immunizing them now. So why would they if they don’t have to?”
Eshenaur, pointed to measles outbreaks in Ontario, Canada and in Texas, both of which allow religious exemptions. As of July 8, Texas reported 753 confirmed measles cases and two fatalities since late January. The Ontario outbreak has infected more than 2,000 people and killed an infant. Most of the cases are in those who are unvaccinated. 
‘You can’t look at just the statewide rate’
According to the CDC, as of last week, the U.S. reported 1,288 measles cases this year, the highest number in 33 years. 
West Virginia last year reported its first confirmed measles case in 15 years. Health experts at the time credited the state’s high vaccination rates as the reason the highly-infectious virus did not spread to others. 
“We know that when a number of children utilize a religious exemption, that it does set up that particular community or area or higher risk of a measles outbreak in particular, given how infectious it is, and we have witnessed that over this past year right here in the United States,” Eshenaur said. 
Dr. Cathy Slemp, who was the state health officer from 2002 to 2011 and again from 2018 to 2020, said the more nonmedical exemptions that are present in a community, the higher the risk of disease and outbreak, among the unvaccinated and in the broader community. 
  “… in general, the laxer the (nonmedical exemption) process, the more exemptions seen and the greater the disease risk,” she said. 
“Even a few cases or a single preventable outbreak have public health impact to those families and to public health and health care system costs of investigation and care,” Slemp said.
Nonmedical exemptions tend to cluster, Slemp said. One town or one school may have a high number of exemptions, leading to pockets of the population that have lower vaccination rates.
“You can’t look at just the statewide rate,” Slemp said. “It would really depend on that community and that school to look at the rates. So when we just look at a statewide rate, it doesn’t tell us the risk of individual communities.”
The vaccination rate needed to achieve “herd immunity” varies by disease. Herd immunity for measles, for instance, requires a 95% vaccination rate.
Morrisey’s comments came during a news conference announcing his support of a lawsuit filed in Raleigh County against the West Virginia Board of Education. The board voted to defy the governor’s executive order and instruct county boards of education to allow only medical exemptions to vaccine requirements.  
Slemp said the issue isn’t about having no evidence, but a question of what a society values.
“It’s a societal question of what freedoms we value most — individual parental choice or societal comfort knowing we’ve done the best we can to protect all, especially infants and others who don’t have the option of being protected by vaccines,” she said.  “We’re not looking at a return to prevaccine day levels of disease, but we can’t say there’s no impact. “

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is working to add as many as 300 additional beds to its overburdened prison system over the next year.
“We’re literally trying to lift up about, as far as I’m concerned, four mini prisons across the state all in the same year,” Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Director Colby Braun told lawmakers at a committee meeting last month.
The state prison system has had a population more than 200 inmates over capacity on average during the past roughly two years. It was 193 male inmates over capacity on average between July 2023 and May 2025, according to data presented at the meeting. The system averaged 31 female inmates over capacity during that same time frame, the data show.
The Legislature this year approved more than $37 million for the 2025-2027 budget cycle to provide immediate relief to prison overcrowding, including by building temporary shelters and  contracting space from jails. The money will also go toward a new reentry facility in northwest North Dakota.
North Dakota breaks ground on first prison designed for women, with focus on rehabilitation

The agency got a little over $8 million to purchase man camps to provide overflow housing within the Missouri River Correctional Center. The department anticipates it to house 72 to 96 inmates, said Michele Zander, chief financial officer for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The $8 million would cover the housing units, an emergency generator, washers and dryers, technology costs and more.
While the agency is still in the process of procuring the buildings, it expects to have the facility open next summer or fall, according to Zander.
There would be an ongoing cost of about $1.3 million to cover staff and supplies for the temporary housing, officials said in a presentation to lawmakers earlier this year.
Another $27.4 million was set aside in the 2025-2027 budget to allow the agency to contract with county and regional jails for additional overflow housing.
This includes an agreement for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to staff and operate a new section of the Grand Forks Jail, which could provide between 60 and 72 beds, according to Zander. She said this change could take effect sometime this fall.
The agency also hopes to enter into a similar agreement with the Burleigh Morton Detention Center. That jail has an unused housing unit that could give the agency another up to 120 beds. 
The idea would be for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide case management and behavioral health services, while the Burleigh Morton Detention Center would handle operations. Zander said the agreement is expected to take effect sometime early next year.
Contract negotiations are still in the works for those two projects, she said.
The department also received a $1.6 million appropriation to establish a 25-bed reentry center somewhere in northwest North Dakota — possibly Minot or Williston. Many incarcerated North Dakotans ultimately hope to return to the area after they wrap up their sentences, but they lack reentry options close to home, Zander said.
“This can cause extra hardship on residents that want to move back home,” she said in an email.
North Dakota prisons find extra inmate beds in county facilities amid overcrowding

Other funding earmarked for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation this budget cycle will go toward building larger prison facilities. $35.6 million was set aside to finish construction of the Heart River Correctional Center, the state’s first prison designed for women. The facility, projected to cost about $166.8 million in total, will have 304 beds and is scheduled to open in fall of 2027.
The state also set aside $20 million to plan a new medium-security prison that’s expected to go next to the State Penitentiary.
The agency last month also provided lawmakers with an estimate for its cost overruns from the 2023-2025 budget cycle, which ended June 30. The 2025 Legislature approved the agency’s request for a deficiency appropriation to cover these costs.
The amount as of late June was expected to be about $11 million. The expenses largely stem from prison overcrowding, according to the agency.
The bulk of the deficiency — a little over $8 million — came from county and regional jails that the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation previously contracted with to house inmates that state facilities don’t have room for.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers have put $31.7 million toward refurbishing the outside of the Louisiana State Capitol. 
The money, included in the annual state construction plan that took effect July 1, will be used to waterproof the Capitol’s exterior in order for it to undergo a thorough cleaning. 
“It is a symbol of Louisiana, and it’s one of the most visited state capitol buildings in the country,” Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said. “We’re taking all the steps we need to waterproof it so it will last another 200 to 300 years.” 

Completed in 1932, Louisiana’s State Capitol is a classic example of the Art Deco design style popular at the time and also used for the Empire State Building in New York City. Its construction took just 14 months. The building was the brainchild of Huey Long, who was a U.S. senator at the time and would be buried on its grounds three years later after his assassination in a Capitol hallway. 

The state will have to find more money in future years to complete the waterproofing project. It is expected to total $113.9 million, according to Louisiana’s construction plan, 

Of the $31.7 million allocated this year, $21 million comes from general state funding and $700,000 from an account set up in 2023 for Capitol repairs. The state plans to borrow the other $10 million.

Today, miners are well informed about the risks surrounding uranium mining, and many steps are taken to protect workers from its effects.
However, during Tutt’s time, such precautions were not taken. He recounts that there was never any communication about risks surrounding uranium mining, and even basic safety measures like the distribution of work gloves were unknown during his time mining in Colorado. Unsurprisingly, Tutt and many of his coworkers would suffer from cancer or other ailments directly related to uranium mining activities.

Claudia Peterson was just 5 years old when she witnessed a large mushroom cloud rising about a hundred miles east of her southern Utah home. By the time she was 35, Claudia was a cancer survivor who had watched her father die of a brain tumor, her six-year-old daughter Bethany die after three years fighting neuroblastoma (a rare type of cancer which primarily affects young children), and her only sister Cathy die of skin cancer.
​Neither of these stories are simply anecdotes. Sarah Fox provides compelling evidence in her 2014 book “Downwind: A People’s History of the Nuclear West” that the Atomic Energy Commission, U.S. Public Health Service, and uranium mining companies all were aware of the serious health risks surrounding radiation poisoning resulting from uranium mining or nuclear bomb testing as early as 1951, but failed to inform miners or other citizens. It would be another 39 years until President George H.W. Bush would sign the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA,, into law, which finally gave compensation for those affected.
Across the states of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, tens of thousands of people have claimed compensation from RECA. That’s because from 1945 to 1962, the U.S. performed 100 above-ground nuclear tests, which released massive amounts of radioactive fallout across the continental U.S. Frustratingly, the Atomic Energy Commission was the commission responsible for performing the tests and maintaining communication with the public about any potential risks from nuclear testing.
This led to a perverse cycle whereby many dangerous nuclear tests were performed with virtually no real public communication about said dangers. And the results were devastating: disproportionate cases of lung, stomach, thyroid, and other types of cancer; severe radiation effects on crops and livestock among a population which was made up of primarily subsistence farmers; many infants and children who died from cancer tied to radioactive isotopes that passed from their mother’s breast milk or cattle’s dairy into their lungs and stomach.
I do not have room here to recount more stories from individual downwinders. Thankfully, that project has been and will continue to be carried out by dedicated scholars like Fox. July 16 is the 80th anniversary of the first Trinity nuclear test. It is a good time for us all to reflect on the importance of government transparency. So long as the government is involved in a particular endeavor, it has the obligation to ensure that there are no serious public health risks from its activities. If there are any risks, the government has the obligation to tell its citizens so that they may vote, either with their feet or by the ballot.
The story of the downwinders is ugly, but it is an important commentary on the need for government transparency. If we fail to take such commentary seriously, we should not be surprised to read about many more George Tutts or Claudia Petersons in the future.

(Getty stock image)After more than a decade of legislative effort to curb the number of kids tried in adult court, Maryland is suddenly facing pressure from political and prosecutorial voices to expand laws automatically treating youths accused of crime as if they were grown ups. At the same time, Vincent Schiraldi — a nationally respected, data-driven leader — stepped down from his post as secretary of the state’s Department of Juvenile Services, declaring he would no longer be complicit in this practice that harms young people.
These two developments are not isolated; they reflect a troubling retreat from evidence and a dangerous reversion to the counterproductive fear-based policymaking of the 1990s.
We have both led major youth justice systems — in New York and California — and worked with leaders across the country to advance policies that actually reduce crime and improve outcomes for young people. What’s happening in Maryland is both familiar to us and deeply frustrating.
When reform begins to work, a few tragic cases are weaponized in the media to paint an entire system as broken, often sparking public panic. Politicians respond with harsh rhetoric, calls to “crack down,” and efforts to undo evidence-based progress.
Schiraldi has offered a powerful defense of the approach he brought to Maryland, which was grounded in decades of research showing that young people are more likely to succeed when held accountable in age-appropriate, rehabilitative systems, not adult jails or prisons. The data is unequivocal: Prosecuting youth as adults, instead of reducing crime, makes kids more likely to commit another, more serious offense and leads to worse long-term outcomes.

Maryland’s current laws charging children as adults are already among the most punitive in the nation. They strip judges of discretion and automatically move cases involving youth as young as 14 to adult court, often with no individualized assessment of maturity, trauma, or potential for rehabilitation. That flies in the face of everything we know about adolescent development, brain science and what really works to keep communities safe.
Let’s be clear: Keeping kids in the youth justice system is not about excusing harm. Accountability matters. But accountability and rehabilitation must go hand in hand in youth justice. True public safety depends on a system that helps young people build better futures, not one that destroys those futures before they have a chance to begin.
Under Schiraldi’s leadership, Maryland made good progress. Seventy-one percent of youth arrested in 2021 had no further contact with the system though 2024; 84% of kids with two prior contacts had no subsequent contact.  Statewide, during the first five months of 2025 the department received 29% fewer referrals for violent crime compared to the same period in 2024.
But you wouldn’t know about these successes from recent headlines. Instead, opponents focused on a handful of difficult cases, using them to stoke fear and justify rolling back change.
We have seen this story before: A tragedy occurs; the public demands action; and rather than look at the data, decision-makers fall back on punitive responses that look like a response, but which will not actually work. It’s easier than the hard, long-term work of building a just and effective system.
What’s at stake here is not just one official’s decision. It’s the future of youth justice in Maryland — and, by extension, the future of the kids and communities that system serves. It is also a dangerous precedent for the rest of the nation. After nearly two decades of declines in youth incarceration and crime, it would be a national tragedy to see the pendulum swing back toward harsher penalties for youth that were associated with higher levels of offending.
We urge Maryland’s leaders — and the public — to resist the politics of fear. Stick with the facts. Research shows that young people are far more likely to succeed when they are met with developmentally appropriate responses, community-based interventions, and second chances.
We also urge solidarity with leaders like Vinny Schiraldi, who take the risk of doing what’s right over what’s politically convenient. It is not easy to step away from a powerful role rather than compromise your values. We’ve both been there. And we know how vital it is that reformers feel supported when they act with courage.
Most of all, we urge people to remember: These are kids. Many of them have experienced trauma, poverty, neglect and systemic racism. They deserve consequences when they cause harm, yes — but they also deserve compassion, support and the opportunity to grow. Our job, as adults and as leaders, is to hold space for both.
Maryland has the tools to build a youth justice system that is smart, fair, and safe. Let’s not abandon that vision now.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Scales-of-justice-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 06:07:19.598159

Cada dos domingos, de 8 p.m. a 8 a.m., Raquel Lane-Arellano espera llamadas de personas en diferentes partes de Colorado que podrían haber visto a agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas, conocido como ICE. Lleva seis años trabajando como voluntaria, pero la primera vez que sonó su teléfono fue en enero. Ahora, durante esas 12 horas dos veces al mes, el teléfono rara vez deja de sonar.
Al recibir una llamada, Lane-Arellano confirma la ubicación con la voz, a menudo temblorosa, del otro lado del teléfono. Luego, notifica a otros voluntarios, quienes van a la ubicación para determinar si el avistamiento es legítimo y documentar la escena, hablar con los lugareños y repartir tarjetas con información sobre los derechos legales de los inmigrantes sin confrontar físicamente a los agentes.
Lane-Arellano es voluntaria como despachadora de una línea directa disponible las 24 horas, los 7 días de la semana, dirigida por la Red de Respuesta Rápida de Colorado, una coalición de organizaciones de inmigración, religiosas y legales. La red fue fundada en 2017 para documentar los avistamientos reportados por ICE y ha reunido a unos 3.000 voluntarios de diferentes partes del estado, según los organizadores.
“El objetivo es asegurarnos de que la gente tenga información y de que intentemos disipar el miedo”, dijo Lane-Arellano, quien también es gerente de comunicaciones de la Coalición por los Derechos de los Inmigrantes de Colorado. “Porque lo que la administración Trump quiere es que nuestra gente tenga miedo todo el tiempo”.

Las organizaciones miembros de la red incluyen la ACLU Colorado, el Comité de Servicio de Amigos Americanos, Mi Familia Vota y Together Colorado. La línea directa estatal es la primera de su tipo en Colorado y también cubre el sur de Wyoming, según los organizadores. Funciona de forma similar a las líneas directas estatales de denuncia del ICE en Oregón, Connecticut y Nueva Jersey, así como a las líneas directas locales en ciudades como Los Ángeles y Detroit.
La red ha visto un aumento rápido tanto en las llamadas a la línea directa como en el interés de los voluntarios desde que el presidente Donald Trump asumió su segundo mandato, debido a un aumento en la aplicación de medidas migratorias. Colorado es un foco particular de la iniciativa de Trump para las deportaciones masivas, y él ha criticado a Aurora en medio de acusaciones falsas de actividad de pandillas.
Desde enero y mediados de junio, los arrestos de ICE en Colorado casi se han cuadruplicado en comparación con el mismo período del año pasado, según datos del ICE obtenidos por investigadores de UC Berkeley. Los investigadores encontraron que 1.360 personas han sido arrestadas por el ICE en Colorado durante la segunda administración de Trump, y muchas no tienen antecedentes penales. Los datos del ICE de Colorado muestran que más de 400 personas arrestadas fueron marcadas como “otras personas de inmigración violador”, en contraposición a “criminal convicto” o “criminal pendiente cargos”.
Uno de esos arrestos fue el de Jeanette Vizguerra, destacada defensora de los derechos de los inmigrantes, que ha vivido en los EE. UU. desde 1997 y actualmente se encuentra detenida por ICE. Sus abogados han alegado ante un tribunal federal que su arresto fue en represalia por su libertad de expresión.
La administración ha recibido un gran aumento de financiación para la represión migratoria a través de la reducción de impuestos republicana y el proyecto de ley de recortes de gastos que Trump firmó a principios de este mes. El proyecto de ley asigna 170 mil millones de dólares a la seguridad fronteriza, la aplicación de la ley migratoria y la contratación de miles de agentes adicionales del ICE, entre otras prioridades de Trump.
La red está en conflicto con el ICE
La red de respuesta rápida llama a sus voluntarios que se acercan y documentan áreas con presencia reportada de ICE “confirmadores”. Los voluntarios participan en una sesión de formación y la red dice que solo los ciudadanos deben hacerlo por el riesgo de encontrarse con ICE.
Andrea Loya se desempeña como directora de la organización no gubernamental de apoyo a inmigrantes Casa De Paz se beneficia, pero fuera del trabajo, también colabora como confirmadora. En sus seis meses de voluntariado, ha salido más de diez veces, y comentó que cada situación es única.
Cada vez que recibe una llamada de un operador, lleva un megáfono, las tarjetas de información y su teléfono. Durante su salida, se mantiene en comunicación frecuente con otros voluntarios de la red para asegurarse de que sepan que está bien y para que puedan publicar actualizaciones en las redes sociales sobre si el ICE está presente en el lugar reportado. Loya dijo que nunca ha hablado con agentes del ICE y que mantiene la distancia cuando está cerca de ellos.
Loya caracterizó la red como un grupo de vigilancia vecinal: documentar actividades no deseadas e informar a los residentes.
“Es importante para nosotros contrarrestar la narrativa de que lo que estamos haciendo es ilegal”, dijo Loya. “Es simplemente una vigilancia vecinal, algo que la gente lleva años haciendo. Cuando entras en barrios muy bonitos y aparcas allí, la gente se acerca y te pregunta qué haces. Eso es lo que hacemos, pero en nuestras comunidades”.

El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional y la oficina local del ICE en Denver han condenado a la red por presuntamente interferir con las operaciones de control migratorio. Representantes de la oficina local de Denver declinaron ser entrevistados para este artículo.
“Grupos como este interfieren con la capacidad de ICE de mantener seguras a las comunidades”, dijo la oficina de campo de Denver en un comunicado.
La oficina de campo de Denver dijo que realizó una operación en Longmont el 20 de junio para detener a un violador de niños, añadiendo que la red de respuesta rápida lo interrumpió.
La división de Denver del ICE se negó a especificar cómo interfirió la red de respuesta rápida y no comentó si hubo altercados físicos o verbales entre agentes y voluntarios de la red. El ICE afirmó en redes sociales que la redada tenía como objetivo a un hombre de El Salvador buscado en Italia, pero no ha presentado ninguna orden judicial ni ninguna otra prueba que demuestre que la redada se centrara en ese hombre o que se encontraba en Longmont.
En una declaración del 25 de junio, la subsecretaria del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Tricia McLaughlin, dijo que la red y sus miembros “interrumpen las operaciones del ICE dirigidas a inmigrantes ilegales criminales peligrosos”.
Jennifer Piper, una líder de larga trayectoria en la red de respuesta rápida, estaba enviando llamadas el 20 de junio. Dijo que un grupo de informadores voluntarios se dirigió a la ubicación de Longmont y hablaron con los lugareños sobre sus derechos, pero no confrontaron ni interfirieron de otra manera con ICE.
“Este incidente incitó a cientos de personas a intentar trollear nuestra línea directa, lo cual no tuvo éxito”, dijo Piper. “Pero esta administración ha difundido mucha desinformación y propaganda. Solo intentamos brindar la mejor información posible a nuestra comunidad”.
Combatiendo el miedo
Lane-Arellano afirmó que documentar los casos en que ICE no está presente en una comunidad es tan importante como documentar la presencia de agentes de inmigración. Esto se debe a que el miedo se ha extendido por las comunidades inmigrantes de Colorado, y es crucial ayudar a sus vecinos a recuperar un nivel de seguridad, dijo.
Cada camioneta blanca o uniforme de policía puede ser una señal de la posible presencia del ICE a personas que temen ser deportadas, especialmente debido a las tácticas del ICE de usar vehículos sin identificación y arrestar a muchos no criminales, agregó.
“Mostramos a la gente lo que realmente está sucediendo, y creo que eso es realmente valioso para que no haya miedo innecesario”, dijo Lane-Arellano. “ICE intenta silenciar ese tipo de trabajo y quiere criminalizarlo. Creo que la gente debería estar muy preocupada cuando hay una entidad gubernamental que nunca rinde cuentas y que intenta minimizar el escrutinio público”.

Algunos de los voluntarios de la red asistieron a una protesta el 7 de julio pidiendo el cierre del Centro de Procesamiento de ICE de Aurora, operado por la empresa de prisiones privadas GEO Group. Vizguerra ha sido detenido allí durante cuatro meses.
La hija de Vizguerra, Luna Báez, fue a las manifestaciones. Si bien las protestas y las publicaciones en redes sociales visibilizan la difícil situación de los detenidos, Báez afirmó que quienes apoyan a los inmigrantes también deberían centrarse en otras medidas de apoyo, como donar a organizaciones sin fines de lucro, brindar servicios de traducción y colaborar como voluntarios con la red de respuesta rápida.
“Se trata de acción directa” Báez dijo. “Hay que sentirse incómodo para desmantelar estos sistemas de opresión.”
Deb Schaffer, residente de Denver, asistió a la protesta y también colabora como confirmadora voluntaria. Hasta el momento, ha participado en unas ocho llamadas.
“Es una forma de apoyar a la comunidad inmigrante y de ser útil, y una forma de sentirse orgulloso de vivir en Colorado”, dijo Schaffer. “Lo estamos haciendo juntos”.
El voluntariado con la red puede tener consecuencias para la salud mental, debido a la intensidad y el sufrimiento que pueden causar las llamadas, dijo Lane-Arellano. Recuerda una llamada que recibió a las 7 a. m. de un director de preescolar del área de Denver, preocupado por la presencia de ICE en las inmediaciones, quien dijo que los padres tenían demasiado miedo de salir de sus autos con sus hijos.
La red envió a alguien quien verificó que en realidad era una agencia policial local. La confirmación de que fue una falsa alarma ayudó a que el preescolar volviera a la normalidad.
Pero esa llamada, y esos padres y niños aterrorizados, quedaron grabados en la memoria de Lane-Arellano.
“Puede ser doloroso, pero lo hago de todos modos por la amabilidad de la gente común”, dijo Lane-Arellano. “Cuando parece que hay tanto odio y crueldad a nivel federal, nos ayuda saber que esto no es lo que defendemos y que hay tanta gente dispuesta a arriesgarse para apoyar a nuestra comunidad”.

Josh Shapiro signed legislation to classify deepfakes in Pennsylvania as digital forgeries, making non-consensual digital impersonation punishable by law.  
Deepfakes are images or videos generated by artificial intelligence, typically for malicious use or to spread misinformation. Now, anyone engaging in digital impersonation will be subject to a misdemeanor of the first degree, while anyone doing so with fraudulent intent will be subject to a felony of the third degree.
“This law gives law enforcement the tools they need to fight this digital deception, yet does so in a responsible manner, protecting First Amendment rights and preserving valid expressions of parody, satire and other forms of free speech,” bill sponsor Sen. Tracy Pennycuick (R-Montgomery) said, after the governor signed it into law last Tuesday.
The bill passed unanimously in the Senate and with near-unanimous support in the House. Pennycuick has previously pushed through legislation to combat digital impersonation, including a law Shapiro signed last October to ban deepfake pornography. 
Pennycuick’s pornography deepfake ban led Republican state Attorney General Dave Sunday to file the first charges involving artificial intelligence in a sexual abuse case in April. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sunday commended the new legislation and Pennycuick for “recognizing the danger that artificial intelligence poses to Pennsylvanians. Having this law on the books adds another tool to our chest as we continue to proactively investigate and hold offenders accountable,” he said. 
Deepfakes pose a widespread public threat, according to Pennycuick, because they include false images impossible to distinguish from real content, which are often “used to commit financial scams, injure personal reputations and disrupt the political process,” she wrote in a statement. 
“The potential for widespread harm will only grow as artificial intelligence tools become more sophisticated and more readily accessible,” Pennycuick wrote in a memo introducing the bill in February. 
In a recent, high-profile case, a deep-fake impersonating former-President Joe Biden’s voice called New Hampshire voters to tell them not to vote in the 2024 presidential primary. 
Digital scams, including artificial intelligence ones, often target vulnerable populations, such as teenagers and the elderly, as well as small businesses.
Seeing a steady increase in payment app scams targeting senior citizens, then-U.S. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) advocated for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to increase its user protections in 2022.
Lawmakers around the country have responded to these challenges by introducing over 38 pieces of legislation in 18 states related to deepfake regulation. That’s according to the Transparency Coalition, a nonprofit advocate for AI regulation. This legislative push follows the 80 laws passed across the country to combat deepfakes in 2024, as well as 15 passed in 2023. 
Although statewide regulations have received bipartisan support from federal lawmakers, they have also received some pushback, including from some Republicans in Congress, who criticize regulations for censorship and diminishing the country’s competitive edge in artificial intelligence. 
Republican U.S. House members originally included a decade-long moratorium on state laws regulating AI in this year’s federal budget before it was eventually removed from the final bill. 
Pennsylvania’s upper chamber is considering another bill on digital forgery regulation, which would ban the use of deepfakes in political campaigns, in an effort to improve election security. 
Deepfake regulation has previously faced pushback in the state legislature on the basis of free speech concerns, including a 2021 bill to ban deepakes from political advertisements.

(Photo courtesy of David Hall)Sandwiched between the Delaware River and closely spaced homes, the Monroe Energy oil refinery in Trainer exemplifies the need for better regulation of a dangerous chemical used around the country to produce high-octane gasoline, environmental groups said.
If highly reactive hydrofluoric acid (HF) was released from the Delaware County refinery, it could form a ground-hugging cloud extending up to 17 miles and affecting as many as 1.9 million people in addition to delicate ecosystems nearby. HF attacks the human body causing burns, organ damage and death, a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claims.
The Philadelphia-based Clean Air Council, the Natural Resources Defense Council and California-based Communities for a Better Environment are suing the EPA in federal court, asking a judge to order the agency to reassess its regulations on the chemical.
Filed last Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the suit follows the EPA’s rejection of a petition by the groups asking the agency to eliminate unreasonable risks from the use of HF at oil refineries. An EPA spokesperson said the agency has a longstanding practice of not commenting on pending litigation. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
HF is used to increase the octane rating of gasoline during the refining process. The groups argue in their lawsuit that more than 40 oil refineries across the country still use HF despite the availability of safer alternatives. The chemical also presents a hazard as it is transported by truck and rail from the only plant where it is manufactured, in Louisiana.
“Needlessly risking release of this extremely hazardous chemical in our densely-packed region where so many people could be injured or killed is reckless. All the other refineries in Pennsylvania manage to use safer alternatives,” Clean Air Council Executive Director Alex Bomstein said in a statement. 
Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Airlines, is not a defendant in the lawsuit, which also details the risks to populations surrounding refineries that use HF in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas.
A spokesperson for Monroe said the safe operation of the refinery is of paramount importance and the plant’s alkylation unit, where HF is used, is constantly inspected. The company has invested millions of dollars in safety systems for the unit, spokesperson Matt McGlaughlin said.
“Monroe Energy has a robust safety culture and a strong safety record that reflects this, having received numerous accolades for our safety performance over the years,” McLaughlin said, noting they include awards from the state and industry groups.
Delaware County spokesperson Ryan Herlinger said the county’s Hazardous Materials Response Team is prepared to respond to a release of HF from the Monroe Energy refinery.
“Delaware County takes the risks associated with HF seriously and maintains the resources, training, and protocols necessary to respond effectively and support our communities,” Herlinger said.
Composed of a single hydrogen and a single fluorine atom, both highly reactive elements by themselves, HF can cause respiratory problems and skin burns in lower concentrations. At higher levels, the chemical can cause gruesome and often fatal injuries by dissolving skin, muscle and bone.
“Poison acid clouds engulfing refinery communities and transit corridors sounds like a horror movie, but it’s a real possibility as long as EPA refuses to engage,” Matthew Tejada, senior vice president of environmental health at NRDC, said.
The lawsuit lists numerous releases of HF that caused injuries, including a 1987 incident in which a cloud of acid blanketed a Texas neighborhood. But south Philadelphia was the site of a near miss that could have had catastrophic consequences.

In the wee hours of June 21, 2019, a fire and massive explosion rocked the Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery, hurling massive pieces of equipment hundreds of yards, with some landing on the other side of the Schuylkill River. More than 5,000 pounds of HF were released along with propane and other refining byproducts.
The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board found the cause of the blast was a 50-year-old section of pipe that ruptured and released liquid propane into the alkylation unit where HF was being used. The Trump administration’s budget for next year eliminates funding for the board, effectively shutting it down.
“A heroic worker was able to divert most of the refinery’s HF inventory — 339,000 pounds — to underground tanks, helping prevent an even greater catastrophe,” the lawsuit says, noting the incident injured five refinery workers and one firefighter, but damaged the plant so badly it never reopened.
Annie Fox, a Clean Air Council employee who works with residents in Trainer, Marcus Hook and other communities around the Monroe Energy plant, said the plant has health impacts on people  who live “literally across the street.”
On Thursday, people in Delaware County reported a strong odor of sulfur or gasoline after a power failure forced an emergency shut down of parts of the plant. A towering flame and column of black smoke were emitted from the refinery’s flare stack, videos on social media showed. 
“That is one of the reasons why Trainer is representative of the refineries across the country that still use HF,” Fox said.
She added that the recent closure of Crozer-Chester Medical Center means that the nearest emergency room is at least 20 minutes away and people say they have little guidance on what to do in a serious emergency.

“They’re not putting out emergency response plans. They’re not educating the medical personnel,” Fox said. “One resident who has lived there her entire life said they used to do very serious drills if there was an explosion there.”
According to the NRDC, the Trainer refinery has had five releases of HF since 1990, although only one happened since Monroe Energy took ownership of the plant in 2012 and none affected members of the public. In 2019, eight employees were exposed to HF during maintenance; five required hospitalization.
McGlaughlin, the Monroe Energy spokesperson, said the company has worked closely for years with the Delaware County Local Emergency Planning Committee and hospitals to provide information about what to do in the event of an HF release.
The county haz-mat team is certified by the state to handle highly hazardous chemical releases and equipped with specialized tools to detect such materials, including HF. Members of the team receive specialized training in HF response and carry a supply of the front-line treatment for exposure, Herlinger, the county spokesperson, said.
Monroe Energy also conducts joint training with local fire companies, including hazardous materials response. 
“We work closely with local first responders in the Delaware Valley, a number of whom are also team members here at the refinery, who in turn share their learnings and knowledge with responders in their communities as well,” McGlaughlin said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1203-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 06:07:19.598159

For the first time since the coal and timber barons, the railroads, and low-wage furniture and textile factories invaded the region in the late 19th century, Appalachia is in a position to control its future. That future will require more visionary thinking than ARC has demonstrated since its birth in 1965, but the agency is needed to implement new ways of development.

Albright, left, and James Roosevelt, the son of the president. (University of Kentucky Libraries, Special Collections Research Center)
The 1964 President’s ARC Report, commissioned by President John F. Kennedy and chaired by James Roosevelt, famously called Appalachia “an island of poverty in a sea of affluence.” That phrase, rooted in the stark realities of Central Appalachia’s coalfields, still resonates today. While the region has moved closer to parity with the rest of the nation, the coalfields remain an unfulfilled promise. 
If ARC has a father, it was John Whisman of Hazard, Kentucky, who convinced 13 governors to back a joint state/federal agency to build highways, create development districts, and prioritize regional planning.  That was a remarkable achievement for a very energetic Jaycee who early in his career sold inflatable buildings before in the early 1960s becoming a state employee under Govs. Combs and Breathitt promoting the ARC concept.  He became the states co-chairman of ARC at its inception.
Whisman once told me the genius of the Appalachian Regional Commission was that it “bribed” governors to focus on their most neglected citizens.
Kentucky Gov. Bert Combs was the first governor to buy into Whisman’s vision and helped persuade the rest of the region’s political establishment to get aboard. 
The agency’s politics and geographical outlines have always been complex. New York joined because of Sen. Robert Kennedy; Mississippi because of Rep. Jamie Whitten. Johnny Waters of Sevierville, Tennessee, who helped ignite Sen. Howard Baker’s political career as his campaign chair for student body president at the University of Tennessee, served as federal co-chair during my tenure at ARC.  
Still, the nation resisted focusing federal resources on just one region, no matter the sacrifice that region has made for the whole nation. In Congress, a representative from Iowa would rise during appropriations debates to call ARC “the longest gravy train in American history.”

Politics thus overruled geographers in defining Appalachia.  What was once referred to as the “Southern Highlands” by the Council of the Southern Mountains and most researchers, Appalachia suddenly had Pittsburgh and Birmingham in its fold and extended down to Elvis Presley’s hometown in northern Mississippi. Central Appalachia, mainly the 60 coalfield counties in Southern West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky, Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee, according to ARC’s definition, had to share federal dollars with 423 counties in ARC’s official territory.  Spreading ARC’s appropriation across a population that now stands at 26.3 million left little more than a few dabs to pass around.   
(Federal level attention to the region has a long history. President Abraham Lincoln charged General O.O. Howard, the head of the Freedmen’s Bureau, to “do something” for the mountaineers who had defied the Confederacy and supported the Union.  Howard’s efforts resulted only in Lincoln Memorial University at Harrogate, Tennessee, and the clapboard fire hazard called Howard Hall, a men’s dormitory at Berea College where I alternatively froze and sweated during my sophomore year.)  
Appalachian Regional Commission’s impact has been uneven
When I joined ARC in 1969, I was one of only three regional natives at an agency dominated by outsiders transferred from the Department of Commerce.  I recall at one point more money per capita had gone into the mountains of Maryland than to any other region, further diluting funds for Central Appalachia, the area that justified the agency’s mission. ARC’s reach across 13 states diluted its original coalfield focus and left the region’s deepest needs only partially addressed.   
Despite $6 billion invested in more than 34,000 non-highway projects since 1965, ARC’s impact has been uneven. The agency’s greatest achievements — relocating rivers, building highways and improving infrastructure — are visible, but so are its failures. It never tackled the low taxation of coal properties, absentee land ownership, or the health and safety crises wrought by extractive industries.

ARC never challenged the Tennessee Valley Authority’s introduction and strong financial and political support of strip mining in Eastern Kentucky. It has said nothing about one of the most destructive environmental impacts anywhere in the nation — mountaintop removal mining, which has cut the tops off more than 500 mountains and filled up valleys and waterways with rock and debris that accelerate flooding. 
In short, the Appalachian Regional Commission has never proffered a vision for change that is appropriate and useful in this century of technologically driven development. Federal black lung benefits alone have funneled nearly $50 billion into the region, dwarfing ARC’s total investment and highlighting the scale of unmet need. 
In fairness, ARC’s legacy includes some remarkable, if complicated, physical transformations. The Pikeville Cut-Through Project, completed in 1987, stands as one of the largest civil engineering undertakings in the Western Hemisphere. Nearly 18 million cubic yards of earth and rock were moved — making it second only to the Panama Canal among earth-moving projects in this hemisphere. The project rerouted the Levisa Fork River, eliminated perennial flooding, opened up hundreds of acres for development, and transformed Pikeville into a regional hub. Yet, Pikeville flooded again in the historic Eastern Kentucky flood of July 2022 and again in February.

Counties identified as economically distressed are concentrated in Kentucky, West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. (Appalachian Regional Commission)
In Grundy, Virginia, ARC funds helped relocate the entire business district to higher ground after repeated flooding. The redevelopment included the construction of a unique three-story Walmart atop a public parking garage, a symbol of both economic renewal and the challenges of reinventing a coal town’s identity.  Still, the $6 billion, combined with Appalachian Development Highway spending in the neighborhood of $30 billion or so, is only pocket change for Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett. 
  Gayle Manchin (Appalachian Regional Commission)
A half-century on, Appalachia has indeed moved closer to parity. Retrospective ARC studies confirm that conditions in Appalachia have improved greatly, and the region is catching up with the rest of the nation. Gayle Manchin, ARC’s federal co-chair and wife of retired Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, echoes that cautiously upbeat note: While noting important gains, she stresses there is still work to be done to reach true parity. 
Recent data show that unemployment in Appalachia dropped by 0.8 percentage points over the past decade — twice the national rate of improvement. Homeownership is now about 6.7 percentage points higher than the U.S. average. Median family income growth is robust in many urban counties, and in 96 ARC counties, median income matches or exceeds the national median. Poverty has fallen across most Appalachian states, but coalfield poverty rates are consistently nearly double the national rate of 12.4%. In many counties in Eastern Kentucky, poverty is double Appalachia’s 10-year overall average of 14.3%, according to ARC.
Land reform could unlock local potential
 President Lyndon Johnson, signing the ARC legislation in March 1965, promised it would launch Appalachia on “the bright highway of hope.”   
Yet, many Appalachian counties still fall in the nation’s poorest 10%. The region’s median household income is only about 82% of the U.S. median.  Appalachia’s population is older and growing more slowly. In Appalachia, 27.3% of adults (age 25-plus) have earned at least a bachelor’s degree, compared to the U.S. national average of 35%. 
So, while the region as a whole has made undeniable progress, areas like Central Appalachia still trail far behind the nation economically and socially. The latest ARC report on county economic status, for fiscal year 2026, identifies 75 counties in Appalachia as “distressed.” Distressed counties are considered the most economically depressed, ranking in the worst 10% of the nation’s counties. Kentucky has more “distressed” counties than any other state.  In many Eastern Kentucky counties, federal transfer payments — Social Security, black lung and other benefits — make up well over half of taxpayer income, according to the IRS. 
  Ron Eller (Carnegie Center)
Ron Eller, retired professor of Appalachian Studies at the University of Kentucky and a Whisman Scholar at ARC, has long argued that true regional renewal requires more than infrastructure and outside investment. As Eller puts it: “Struggling regions of the country need land reform, including the reduction of absentee land ownership and the promotion of alternative land use.”  
Eller’s research highlights how generations of absentee corporate and elite ownership have drained Appalachia of its wealth and stifled local development. He emphasizes that growth without real development — without addressing who owns and benefits from the land — will never be enough to reverse the region’s fortunes.   
Coal and timber companies own 30% to 70% of the land in counties in the coalfields, frequently the best lands for development. The largest single landowner in the region is the federal government. 
These facts of land ownership and scandalously low taxation were documented in a 1980 study championed by ARC Federal Co-Chair Al Smith, but the study was shelved and has never been updated. 
Remaking the Appalachian Regional Commission for the 21st century
To truly transform the region, the Appalachian Regional Commission must move beyond the legacy of highways and infrastructure and embrace a tech-forward, community-driven vision that addresses the root causes of generational poverty and outmigration.  
To begin, implementing a transparent, digital land ownership system would finally expose the web of absentee ownership and hidden tax loopholes that have plagued the region for generations. Local governments could plan smarter, enforce fair taxation, and ensure that the wealth of Appalachia benefits its people.  
  Gov. Andy Beshear, right, visited Letcher County in April to announce grants for road and sewer construction to serve the proposed Grand View subdivision on a reclaimed strip mine site in Jenkins — part of Beshear’s plan to replace housing lost to flooding on “higher ground.” (Gov. Andy Beshear Instagram)
Next, a modern homesteading act could acquire land from bankrupt and/or ailing coal and timber companies and offer it to returning families and entrepreneurs, reversing outmigration and seeding new communities above the floodplain. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is leading the charge to locate communities on higher ground above the flood plain. Coal and timber companies have been scarce in offering their lands for this effort. ARC could have, and still can, take up Eller’s challenge to initiate land reform in the coalfields. 
Using modern analytics, ARC could help counties enforce honest property taxes on coal, timber, and mineral holdings. Even modest improvements could generate millions annually for local schools, clinics and infrastructure — resources long denied by absentee corporations. Support for innovative community land trusts would keep wealth local, allowing former mine sites to be redeveloped for agriculture, housing or recreation.  
This grassroots land reform would prevent future extraction of both resources and profits and focus on renewable power, innovative agriculture and timber management, repurposing millions of acres of damaged land, and a host of other development practices that are being tried in other regions and nations. In fact, all over the mountains efforts like these are being undertaken by community groups, but those efforts need large infusions of federal support if they are to uplift the region to national economic and social levels.  Sadly, the Trump administration is proposing to stripmine away the few budgetary dollars currently allocated to these efforts. The cuts just imposed on Medicaid, food aid through SNAP and other programs will darken the bright spots of regional progress. 
Doubling down on education, health care and job training — delivered via technology — would help coalfield counties overcome geographic barriers. Expanding community colleges and vocational programs can equip the next generation to build a diversified economy. Strengthening community development organizations ensures that Appalachian residents — not outside investors — shape their own future. Democratic planning tools can give real voice to those most affected by policy decisions. 
These suggested reforms are not “feel-good” measures. They are systemic, targeted responses to the structural causes of poverty and underdevelopment. As one local leader put it, “there’s not one silver bullet to replace coal … there are a lot of silver BBs.” Each incremental step toward local control and accountability helps reverse a century of extractive policy and absentee governance.

Calling JD Vance
Restoring hope and trust to a region long disappointed by promises of sustained aid that never came is critical bedrock for change.  I’ll be the first to admit that thinking these things can happen in the current Gilded Age environment is a truly Herculean leap of faith.

That brings me to Vice President JD Vance. With roots in Breathitt County, Kentucky, and a professed concern for Appalachia, Vance is in a position to fight for the region. But so far, his only major initiative tied to the region has been AppHarvest — a flashy but failed indoor farming venture based in Morehead. Vance invested in the business and sat on the board with Martha Stewart. 
If Vance and his Silicon Valley allies want to prove their new approaches to development and governance, supporting ARC and pushing for genuine reforms would be a good place to start. Appalachia can be the proving ground for whether government can work differently, and better. If Vance and the tech innovators who talk about reimagining government are serious, Appalachia offers a perfect laboratory for bold, non-welfare reforms that could set a new model for federal engagement. 
The region that was once “an island of poverty in a sea of affluence” stands at a crossroads. The bridge that ARC represents is more necessary than ever — not as a relic of the past, but as the foundation for a bold, tech-forward, and community-driven future.

(Mint Images/Getty Images)A Washington D.C.-based nonprofit spent over $400,000 on ads in the final weeks of the 2025 Rhode Island legislative session to persuade state lawmakers to vote against legislation aimed at protecting a federal drug pricing mandate from manufacturer interference. 
But it wasn’t enough.
The General Assembly ultimately passed the tripartisan legislation to prevent drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) from controlling patient access to discounted medications under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. The program, which began in 1992, requires manufacturers to offer steep discounts to participating providers, often small community health centers and safety net hospitals.
Gov. Dan McKee signed the companion bills by Rep. Jon D. Brien, a Woonsocket independent, and Sen. Bridget Valverde, a North Kingstown Democrat, into law on June 27. The legislation had overwhelming support in the House, including from nine of the chamber’s 10 Republicans. Both bills saw unanimous approval by the Senate.
Rhode Island House lights up to protect federal drug discount program from Big Pharma

Rhode Island now joins a growing list of states that have passed laws to defend contract pharmacy use or prohibit PBM discrimination against 340B entities. The laws have come in response to restrictions imposed by manufacturers on 340B participants limiting where prescriptions can be dispensed, especially those filled at contract pharmacies, like a patient’s local CVS or Walgreens, that fill prescriptions on a provider’s behalf. 
The law allowing Rhode Island’s new protections takes effect Oct. 1, 2025.
Rhode Island’s 340B program received a boost from the state’s fiscal 2026 budget, which called on the Executive Office of Health and Human Services to align itself with some of the same actions in Brien and Valverde’s bills, such as preventing manufacturer discrimination against contract pharmacies. The budget clause also asks for annual reports from 340B providers and oversight from the Auditor General.  
The new law is a blow to the Big Pharma lobbyists who have been critical of 340B, arguing that hospitals and pharmacies exploit the federal program for profit. Such was the message in the 789 TV and radio spots urging Rhode Island lawmakers to “stop 340B abuse today” purchased by Community Action for Responsible Hospitals during the final weeks of the legislative session.
“Rhode Island families go broke, CEOs get rich,” stated a TV ad that aired on WJAR Channel 10 during the weeks surrounding the end of the legislative session, which wrapped up June 21.
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals’ website describes its membership as “patient-focused stakeholders” including labor unions, faith leaders, health care providers, consumer advocates, and public interest groups.
The Washington-D.C. group spent $178,881 to air ads on Channel 10 and cable, along with radio stations WPRO and WEAN, between mid May and late June, according to filings made with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
“I saw a couple of the ads on TV, and it struck me,” Matthew Ulricksen, an associate professor of political science for the Community College of Rhode Island, said in an interview. “I don’t really remember seeing much of an advertising campaign by interest groups around a state budget debate before.”
Ulricksen said the little information available suggests the group could be Big Pharma companies masquerading as a pro-labor, pro-consumer.
“If Bristol-Myers Squibb Company runs an ad on TV in Rhode Island, that’s going to raise peoples’ eyebrows,” he said. “[Instead], they look like a public interest group that is doing this for a noble purpose rather than corporations that are lobbying to protect their bottom lines.” 
The ads also caught Brien’s eyes and ears. The lawmaker said he believes the money to pay for them came from pharmaceutical companies.
“I felt that every time they ran that ad that it helped our cause,” Brien said in an interview. “I was able to say the only opposition we have is Big Pharma — this is them and they’re lying to you, as usual.”
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals lists transparency in hospital ownership and pricing among its primary policy priorities. But as a not-for-profit 501(c)(4), the group is not required to reveal its donors. However, it must file a statement of revenues and expenses annually with the IRS, though the organization is not listed on the federal government’s nonprofit database.
The group’s social media presence consists of accounts on X, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube — all with relatively few followers and posts since going online in the spring. The YouTube channel has one subscriber and no content at all.
“That’s exactly what they do — it’s slapdash,” Ulricksen said of pop-up lobbying groups.

Pro-labor or not?
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals’ website claims that 340B “hurts labor.” But the labor union representing Rhode Island’s health care workers backed the state’s 340B legislation. SEIU 1199NE wrote to the House Committee on Health and Human Services in April that the bill was a way the state could “help prevent the collapse of our community health infrastructure.”
The group is not on the radar of the state’s most powerful union leader.
“That does not sound familiar to me,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said when asked if he had heard of Community Action for Responsible Hospitals.
The Rhode Island Secretary of State’s lobby tracker database lists at least 13 pharmaceutical companies registered to lobby the General Assembly in 2025. Four —  Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers-Squibb Company, Amgen Inc., and Sanofi — indicated their opposition to the 340B legislation, H5634 and S114. Johnson & Johnson, Alexion, GlaxoSmithKline, Purdue Pharma, Otsuka, Novartis, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, and Vertex did not list any stance on the legislation.
Merck & Co. was listed as “watching” the companion bills, according to its filings with the state.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), one of several trade groups registered to lobby at the State House, testified in opposition before the House Committee on Health Human Services on April 10.
Rhode Island Current reached out to PhRMA to inquire about its familiarity with Community Action for Responsible Hospitals. 
“I have not heard of them,” Stami Turk, director of state public affairs for PhrMA, said in a phone interview.

So, who’s behind the group?
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals officially registered as a lobbyist with the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s Office on May 27 — less than a month before the end of the 2025 legislative session. Faith Cybowski, spokesperson for the office, said it’s very common for entities to pop up late into the legislative year.
“The requirement is just that the lobbyist registers within seven days of conducting the lobbying activity and then files reports as required,” Chybowski said via text message.
Two reports detailing the group’s lobbying activity were submitted to the state. The reports list no contributions related to opposing the 340B legislation. But two disbursements totaling $404,845 are listed for advertising by Fifty-Six Media LLC — a New York City firm that boasts itself as “leading brands into the next generation of the internet.”
The reports list one lobbyist: Michael Kapsa, with a phone number and email address. The voicemail greeting indicates the user has a Google Voice number to handle calls. Rhode Island Current left three messages, none of which were returned.
But Kapsa responded to an email with a brief statement critical of Valverde’s legislation:
“Senate Bill 114 lacks transparency and oversight and would accelerate the misuse of the 340B program that drives up costs for Rhode Island patients, union members, and underserved communities,” Kapsa wrote. “It gives a blank check to bad actors who abuse 340B to pad profits instead of helping patients.”
Kapsa is the chief financial officer for SolidaritUS Health, a Washington D.C.-based health care group that partners with local insurance exchanges that share claims databases to develop primary care programs for employer and labor union employees. 
SolidaritUS was founded in 2017 as an offshoot of “America’s Agenda,” an alliance of labor, business, health care providers and policymakers with Kapsa serving as its chief economist. The company’s chairman is Dick Gephardt, the former Democratic Missouri congressman turned lobbyist whose firm has represented the multinational pharmaceutical company Bayer.
In 2021, Kapsa was tapped by the Biden administration to join a federal advisory committee meant to help the U.S. Department of Labor develop a standard format for group health plans to all payer claims databases.
FCC filings list Kapsa’s name as the primary ad buyer in Rhode Island. They also name Dr. Steven Sleigh as the president of Community Action for Responsible Hospitals. Sleigh is a D.C.-area consultant who previously worked for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
The names of both Sleigh and Kapsa appear on a 990 tax form submitted by the Pbm Accountability Project, a pop-up lobby that aired ads in Washington D.C. in 2023 as Congress considered various bills meant to ensure PBMs keep drug prices low.
Rhode Island Current reached out to Sleigh on June 30 and followed up on July 3.
“Really don’t have any comment on the Rhode Island situation,” Sleigh said in an email response on July 3.
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals also led lobbying efforts against legislation to protect the 340B program in Oregon and Illinois. Their lobbying was unsuccessful in Oregon while the bill in Illinois is still under consideration.
Brien likened the group’s expensive efforts in Rhode Island to “the last gasp of a dying man.”
“They could have thrown a million dollars at this thing and you weren’t going to move the legislators in the House and the Senate on this one,” he said. “You could have run them every 10 minutes and it wouldn’t have mattered.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The University of Louisville has disbanded the UofL Women’s Network and four other employee groups in response to a new state law.
A former president of one of the disbanded groups criticized the action, telling the Kentucky Lantern it goes further than required by the Republican legislature’s new ban on diversity initiatives in public higher education.
Ricky Jones, former president of the UofL Black Faculty/Staff Association and professor of Pan-African Studies, said the employee resource groups provided safe spaces for underrepresented people and allowed them to have “a unified voice to speak to the administration about issues.” 
Jones criticized administrators at UofL and other universities for bowing to political pressure on decisions about diversity, equity and inclusion on campus. He predicted the assault on diversity in Kentucky higher education will “get worse before it gets better.”
“Higher education in Kentucky, for Black folk in particular, and for other groups that are being targeted, I think it’s a lost cause at this point, unless something drastic changes. And we don’t have leadership at these schools that are committed to making those types of changes, so we’re in trouble.”
In addition to the groups for Black and women faculty and staff, UofL has eliminated the Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander Faculty and Staff Association; Hispanic Latino Faculty and Staff Association; and the LGBTQ+ Faculty and Staff Association.
After a review, some university resource groups “were deemed not to be” in compliance with the new law, said UofL spokesperson John Karman. 
“Our Employee Success Center will continue to explore ways to support meaningful engagement and to ensure all UofL faculty and staff are valued and supported,” Karman added. 
Employee resource groups, or ERGs, were created to “promote a climate of inclusion and provide a place where employees can come together to network, create a strong sense of community, and share their concerns,” according to a now-removed UofL web page description.
Earlier this year, Kentucky’s Republican-controlled General Assembly passed House Bill 4, which eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and resources at all public universities and colleges within the commonwealth. The universities were directed to enact changes to meet the law’s requirements by June 30, 2025. 
UofL and Kentucky’s other public universities began reviewing policies in the spring shortly after the law was passed. Eastern Kentucky University adopted a viewpoint neutrality policy and a resolution saying EKU plans to comply with the law in May. Before the 2025 legislative session, the University of Kentucky and Northern Kentucky University disbanded their diversity offices amid scrutiny of DEI programs nationally. 
UofL President Gerry Bradley outlined how university administration reviewed programs and resources for compliance with the law in a June 27 email to campus. That included work groups reviewing areas of “position analysis; policy analysis; admissions, financial aid and scholarships; and athletics.” The work group submitted recommendations to UofL’s legal counsel and a Board of Trustees committee. The board considered policy changes during a June 26 meeting. 
Bradley wrote in his email that decisions to implement changes “were difficult to make in the face of our work to build a culture of belonging — a culture that supports all, that is welcoming of all and reflects our community of care.” He acknowledged that people “have felt hurt and abandoned during this process,” adding that he has “heard your voices and understand the feelings expressed.”
“Let me assure you that I stand by my commitment to support and celebrate all of our community and meet their needs,” Bradley said. “This matter will continue to spark important and necessary conversations about ideas of belonging, success, access to higher education and more. 
“With this challenge comes an opportunity for all of us to remain committed to making the University of Louisville a place where we embrace differences and celebrate uniqueness. We will continue to do so with compassionate and steadfast resolve.”
Jones, the UofL professor, said the university’s actions speak louder than the president’s words. He said the state’s new anti-DEI law makes no mention of the kinds of employee groups that UofL ordered dismantled and said administrators chose to be “more aggressive about anti-diversity moves” than the bill required. “Either they agree with the uber-conservative legislators coming out of Frankfort who are doing real and meaningful harm to Black people, LGBTQ people and others” or “they just don’t care,” Jones said. 
“I think it’s just a feeling of hopelessness there right now,” he said. “It’s to the point now even those of us who have spoken out over the years, it’s like, ‘Speak out for what?’ This is over.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3826-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 06:07:19.598159

What happened when 2 KY cities tried to raise wage
The Kentucky legislature in 2017 enacted a law that preempts local governments from requiring employers to provide fringe benefits such as sick leave. The law also bars local governments from raising the minimum wage.
The action reinforced a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling from the year before that struck down local minimum wage increases in Louisville and Lexington.
The court ruled 6-1 that cities in Kentucky lack the authority to establish a minimum wage different from that set by the state.
The Louisville ordinance had required employers to pay at least $8.25 an hour and Lexington’s $8.20 an hour. 
Kentucky’s statewide minimum wage has been $7.25, the same as the federal minimum, since 2009. 

Nearly 73 million workers live in the 18 states, including Kentucky, that now have such preemptive laws, according to a new report from A Better Balance, a legal advocacy organization focused on workplace rights, and the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.
“Local leaders know what’s best for their communities. To take away the decision-making power from local communities on this issue and others is very, very concerning,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director of the Southern office at A Better Balance, and one of the report’s authors.
Among the 18 states included in the report was Missouri. The legislature passed a measure in May to repeal paid leave requirements voters had approved in November that expanded access to paid sick leave for about 728,000 workers who lacked it. Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe on Thursday signed the statewide repeal into law. Local paid sick leave laws have been banned in Missouri since 2017.
Kehoe in a statement called the paid sick leave mandates “onerous,” saying they dictated when and how sick leave was provided and had “burdensome” recordkeeping and compliance obligations.
Nationwide, about 27 million workers don’t earn paid sick days, the report found. Many of them work low-wage and part-time jobs, and they’re disproportionately likely to be women, younger workers and people of color, according to the report.
“Folks are facing impossible choices between their own health — or the health of their children — and continuing to earn a paycheck to pay bills and put food on the table,” Freeland told Stateline.
In the absence of federal laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers, more cities and local governments have passed their own, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Seattle.
But lawmakers in 18 states, mainly in the South and Midwest, have done the opposite, the report found. GOP legislators have said such paid leave requirements create financial hardship for employers, particularly for smaller businesses.
Over the past decade, in GOP-led states across the country, Republican lawmakers have tried to limit the policymaking power of Democratic-led urban centers on issues ranging from immigration to voting rights to LGBTQ+ matters.
While all of the states that preempt local paid sick leave laws are Republican-led, many conservative-led states in the Mountain West don’t have such laws.
Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership and another author of the report, said that’s because Western states tend to have more of a libertarian bent. And she said preemption laws in the South have their roots in historically racist standards that undervalue Black workers.
More than half the Black labor force — 56% — lives in one of the 18 states that prohibit local paid sick time protections, the report said.
Freeland also pointed out that the paid sick leave issue impacts not just urban centers, but rural communities as well. Many people without paid sick leave work in physically demanding jobs such as manufacturing and farming.
The report’s authors say that paid sick leave laws can help reduce the spread of illness, increase employment and wages, particularly for women with child care responsibilities, and can help recruit and retain workers.

That includes championing policies that attract key industries and jobs to help move the state’s economy forward.
However, this goal is currently in jeopardy. Wall Street hedge funds and foreign interests have recently found another way to expand their influence and profit lines by financing lawsuits lawyers would typically decline. These third-party funders are then repaid by receiving a substantial amount of a lawsuit’s settlement funds. 
This blatant tactic to exploit our nation’s legal system for financial gain comes at the economic expense of everyday businesses, including those in Colorado. Specifically, according to Bloomberg, Russian president Vladimir Putin and his allies are using our country to invest in third-party litigation that has allowed them to make millions. To protect our economy and businesses, leaders in Washington should consider the Protecting Our Courts from Foreign Manipulation Act to stop this foreign involvement.

These agreements have enabled third-party funders to exploit cracks in our legal process to weaken the integrity of our judicial system. A reporting segment from 60 Minutes last year notes that third-party funders create a conflict of interest between a lawyer and the plaintiff. Although attorneys maintain that they are working in their client’s best interests, the funds required to bring a lawsuit are being financially paid for by the outside, third-party funder who demands a return on their investment. This fact grants them major leverage over the direction of a case, as these financiers can prioritize their own objectives over that of the actual client.
Third-party funders have used this influence to improve their bottom line at the expense of our economy. As Swiss Re Institute found, these financiers have prolonged cases for nearly a year and a half for their own financial benefit, even if the parties involved want to negotiate a reasonable settlement on a short timeline. Burford Capital, an investment firm involved in third-party litigation, attempted to influence a case to a whole other level by suing their client, Sysco Foods, for accepting a settlement Burford thought wasn’t good enough for their bottom line.
Colorado has especially felt the economic impact of third-party litigation. This industry has  effectively bolstered mass‑tort litigation in the state, now amounting to an estimated $8.5 billion annually — significantly increasing legal risk and costs for Colorado businesses.
Furthermore, by dragging out cases, these third-party funders are also increasing defense and liability expenses for businesses by 20%, according to the Swiss Re Institute. This takes away resources that would otherwise be used by businesses to expand their products and services, employ additional workers, and contribute to and invest in their local economy and communities. Instead, these costs are being passed on to our communities resulting in higher prices on everyday items. 
In health care/medical liability, we see complex cases where it may be years before a patient realizes they had an adverse medical outcome. From there, the legal process can take several more years to determine if the outcome was an unanticipated result or truly due to medical negligence. While we do not yet know the extent of third-party funding in medical liability because current laws do not dictate any transparency requirements, we have begun to see how it can influence judicial proceedings.
As reported in a Law360 article last year, a Minnesota federal judge called a $110 million verdict award in a medical liability case “shockingly excessive.” This case demonstrates how the silent and unreported involvement of litigation financiers can escalate awards to unpredictable amounts, disrupting costs to healthcare providers and inevitably patients.
While longer lifecycle cases can sometimes lead to higher settlements, third-party funders often receive the majority share of the money awarded, taking advantage of people at an incredibly vulnerable time. An example of a health care-related case, reported in a 2019 New York Times article, highlighted how even though women who suffered injuries from pelvic mesh implant manufactured products won billions of dollars in damages, a hefty amount of the awarded funds went to third-party funders and their attorneys. This meant that thousands of victims were left with little money to help treat their medical issues, all while the third-party litigation funding industry stuffed their pockets.
Now, even our foreign adversaries are taking advantage of the lack of regulation in the third-party litigation funding industry to secretly target our economy and national security. Recent reporting from Bloomberg affirms that Russian billionaires with ties to Putin invested $20 million in bankruptcy cases in New York and London. They are now also threatening to go after our national security infrastructure, including semiconductor companies and defense firms.
We saw this happen in 2019, when the Wall Street Journal reported how foreign actors secretly funded third-party litigation behind the defunct company VLSI Technology to attack Intel Corporation, taking billions away from them.
There is a way for Congress to provide transparency within the third-party litigation funding industry. The Protecting Our Courts from Foreign Manipulation Act is a way for Congress to provide transparency within this industry and would stop foreign involvement while protecting our economy and businesses.

The closest in-state labor and delivery unit to Young’s home is Hot Springs’ CHI St. Vincent hospital. Even routine prenatal medical appointments required Young to take time off work during her first pregnancy, she said, but this time CHI’s AR MOMS system of mobile health clinics has alleviated the problem.

“It has made a big impact for us financially, because it saves us from having to be out of gas money, out of time,” said Young, a Medicaid beneficiary and her household’s only income earner.
The AR MOMS mobile health clinics help fill a growing need in rural Southwest Arkansas, which has few maternal health care providers and only four delivery hospitals: two in Hot Springs, one in Camden and one in Mena. Texarkana’s hospital stopped delivering babies after a new owner bought the facility last year, and the hospital on the Texas side of the state line does not accept Arkansas Medicaid.
AR MOMS has a presence in eight small cities: Nashville, De Queen, Mt. Ida, Glenwood, Magnolia, Amity, Fordyce and Murfreesboro. The program serves pregnant residents of Montgomery, Polk, Pike, Howard, Sevier, Hot Spring, Clark, Dallas, Calhoun, Ouachita and Columbia counties.
“With our mobile clinics, moms can drive 30 minutes or five minutes and receive their prenatal care much earlier, which is the goal: to see all the moms in the first trimester and identify any needs that they have,” such as housing and nutrition benefits, transportation assistance and perinatal mental health care, registered nurse and AR MOMS director Dawne Sokora said.
The program launched in September 2023 and is funded by a $4 million federal rural maternity obstetrics grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.










The question is going to be: Will we be able to do as much for our moms as far as social determinants of health and being able to facilitate transportation and those sorts of things for them?


– Dawne Sokora, registered nurse and AR MOMS director


Like Young, Brittney Santos has relied on Hot Springs for labor and delivery services, but when she had her first child in 2010, she lived in Arkadelphia and gave birth there. Arkadelphia’s hospital no longer has a labor and delivery unit.
Santos now lives in Daisy, a Pike County town of fewer than 100 people, and visited AR MOMS’ Glenwood location during her high-risk pregnancy last year.
“They were sweethearts,” Santos said. “They tried to take care of me the best they could…but there was only so much they could do for me.”

When Santos sought help for early cervical dilation during her pregnancy last year, she sought help from the AR MOMS clinics in Glenwood and De Queen, but neither could help. They directed her to Hot Springs.
Seven months postpartum, Santos said she is still experiencing pain and mobility issues but has not received the care she needs because Hot Springs providers are “so busy they can’t help you after you have the baby.”
For Young, the mobile clinics provide “peace of mind” due to Southwest Arkansas’ shortage of providers and long drives to regular clinics and hospitals. Young hasn’t had problems during her second pregnancy, she said, but providers at Nashville’s AR MOMS clinic have given her medication to reduce her risk of developing preeclampsia, which she had during her first pregnancy.
“They call, they check on you…They’re always offering a helping hand,” Young said. “Other times, I’ve had experiences where it’s not been like that, where they just want you in and out real quick.”
 Provider reimbursements

The future of the clinics is uncertain, however. The program is expected to end in August 2026, but Sokora said she hopes the federal government will extend the program because she plans to have excess funds as a result of being “very frugal.”
Sokora said she previously stretched a $690,000 federal grant for a three-year maternal health program into five years, but she acknowledged that meeting pregnant rural Arkansans’ needs takes a lot more than frugality.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has issued a series of executive orders and other guidance pausing, halting or throwing into uncertainty a wide range of federal grants. Sokora said she’s not worried about losing the grant sustaining AR MOMS with one year left, but she worries she won’t be allowed to “roll over excess funds” for the program’s final year.
“The question is going to be: Will we be able to do as much for our moms as far as social determinants of health and being able to facilitate transportation and those sorts of things for them?” Sokora said. “I believe that we will be able to sustain the grant past [2026], but it will be on a much smaller scale.”
A new state law will be “the only reason” AR MOMS is likely to last beyond the grant’s expiration date, Sokora said. The Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act separated the billing rates for labor and delivery and allowed health care providers throughout Arkansas to bill for community health workers, doulas and perinatal mental health specialists.
Bills to improve Arkansas maternal health, change ballot initiative process head to Sanders’ desk

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services authorized a 70% increase in Arkansas’ maximum reimbursement rate for obstetrical care “to include prenatal, delivery and postpartum care,” according to a rule authorized by state lawmakers last month in order for the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act to go into effect.
The Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act passed the Legislature with bipartisan support, but some lawmakers took issue with lowering the statute of limitations for legal actions against alleged medical injuries during birth from children’s 11th birthday to their fifth.
Only 33 hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units, and six maternity wards have closed since 2020. The medical malpractice insurance required to cover the previous 11-year statute of limitations contributed to the closures and fosters the state’s difficulty recruiting and retaining obstetrician-gynecologists, said Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, the primary Senate sponsor of the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act.
Maternal health professionals are “not going to make a living” in rural areas without additional policy changes, Sokora said.
“In these small towns where 80% of your patients are on Medicaid, and the reimbursement is so low, I think the reimbursement going up will help just as much as the malpractice [insurance] going down,” Sokora said.

The legislature that convenes in January will enact a two-year state budget. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Kentucky state government revenue grew by only a fraction of 1% in the fiscal year that ended June 30.
The Office of State Budget Director reports that receipts to the state’s General Fund for the year totaled $15.7 billion.
That was $132 million, or 0.8%, more than the fund took in the previous fiscal year.
The tiny growth rate is actually a bit of good news because the state budget anticipated no growth for the year.
Kentucky’s 2024-26 budget passed by lawmakers in early 2024 anticipated no revenue growth last year largely because of income tax rate cuts in recent years. Also, the state was leaving a period of extraordinary growth from 2020-24 due to federal stimulus spending during the Covid pandemic combined with high inflation that flooded the treasuries of virtually all states.
But falling short of budgeted expectations in the last fiscal year were the General Fund’s largest sources of income — the sales tax and the income tax, according to the July 10 report.
The sales tax took in $5.8 billion, which is the same amount it took in during the prior year, and about $250 million short of what had been anticipated in the current budget.
The income tax took in $5.3 billion, which was about $490 million lower than it took in during the 2024 fiscal year and $227 million short of expectations.
The weakness in the sales and income tax revenue was more than offset by an unforeseen increase in revenue from business taxes. “Major business taxes far exceeded the official estimates offsetting lower than forecasted income and sales tax receipts,” State Budget Director John Hicks said in Thursday’s report. “Strength in business taxes demonstrates that Kentucky businesses are producing at a profitable level,” Hicks said.
The $132 million is a “revenue” surplus, but not the final surplus. The final surplus, which will be transferred to the state’s Budget Reserve Trust Fund, is likely to be somewhat smaller after accounting for state spending for the year is completed later this month.
The end of the fiscal year poses the question of whether the state’s fiscal condition is strong enough to allow the General Assembly to again cut the income tax rate. A landmark 2022 law set up conditions that must be met and a process by which the General Assembly can incrementally cut the income tax rate by one-half percentage point per year. That law’s goal  is to eventually eliminate the state income tax.
Under the law, the Republican supermajorities in the Kentucky House and Senate reduced the income tax rate in 2022 from 5% to 4.5%, in 2023 from 4.5% to 4% percent and early this year from 4% to 3.5%. (The rate cut passed this year does not take effect until Jan. 1, 2026.)
The 2022 law allows another half percentage point cut to be considered so long as two specific conditions are met: The balance in the Budget Reserve fund is at least 10% of what total General Fund receipts were in the fiscal year, and that revenue would still have exceeded General Fund spending in the prior fiscal year even if the income tax rate had been 1 full percentage point lower.
(The complicated income tax reduction law has been amended since 2022 in ways that make it easier to meet the conditions for half-point rate cuts, and also to allow lawmakers to consider rate cuts of less than a half percentage point under certain circumstances.)
  Sen. Christian McDaniel, chair of the Senate budget committee, speaks on the Senate floor, March 11, 2025. (LRC Public Information)
The State Budget Office must yet account for spending during last fiscal year and make other calculations before it determines whether the 2022 law would allow for another half percentage point cut during the 2026 General Assembly. The office must report its conclusion to the legislature by Sept. 5.
State Sen. Chris McDaniel, the Ryland Heights Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee, said he is not sure whether the threshold will be met. “We’ll see. … But as I’ve said before, we knew when we passed the rate reduction this year that the next cut would be a taller order.”
Jason Bailey, executive director of the progressive think tank Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the revenue numbers for last fiscal year raise significant concerns “that really aren’t surprising.”
Bailey said, “The income tax was down, mostly because of rate cuts, but the sales tax leveled off and fell below its estimate. … Those are the two largest sources of revenue.
“It’s only because of such high revenues from business taxes —which are notoriously volatile sources of revenue — that the gap was closed,” Bailey said.
Growth in state government’s other major fund — the Road Fund — was also flat in the 2025 fiscal year. The July 10 report says the Road Fund brought in $1.86 billion for the year. That was $11 million less than the fund’s revenue in 2024, but nearly $39 million more than was anticipated in the state budget for the year.
 The Road Fund pays for highway construction and maintenance and other transportation programs. It is funded by the gasoline tax, the sales tax on vehicles and various fees. The General Fund pays for other state programs and is funded by most state taxes.

(Photo courtesy of American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation)I’ve worked in the casino business for 30 years. For the past seven years, I’ve worked in Rhode Island casinos where I’m forced to breathe secondhand smoke every single shift to keep my job — a health risk to which no other workers in this state are subjected. You might think smoking is a relic of the past, but tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure remain leading causes of preventable death and disease. And thanks to a loophole in Rhode Island’s clean indoor air laws, the two casinos in Lincoln and Tiverton are among the few places where employees are still exposed to deadly toxic air, day-in and day-out.
Lawmakers were ready to close that loophole last month. But not quite.
I love my job, but it’s taken a toll. For years I’ve been on medication to manage the damage from the smoke. When casinos went smokefree indoors during COVID, I finally got a break. But in 2022, when smoking returned, so did the poison. Workers started getting sick all over again. It took nine grueling months to get back on medications and six months of sick leave just to regain enough strength to return. Even after moving to an office job as an iGaming shift manager to avoid the worst of it, my asthma still flares up. I keep a nebulizer on site just to manage it. This isn’t just my story. Hundreds of casino workers — dealers to back office staff — face this daily exposure. 
Like many other states during the pandemic, Rhode Island temporarily prohibited indoor smoking in casinos for two years to protect public health. It proved what we’ve always known: Smokefree gaming is possible and profitable. When protections ended and workers were once again needlessly exposed, casino workers began speaking out and formed Casino Workers Against Smoking Effects (CEASE), which has grown to thousands of members nationwide. Smokefree casinos are already the standard in Massachusetts, New York, and Tribal casinos in Connecticut.
But after years of fighting, three days before the end of the 2025 legislative session, the Rhode Island Senate was finally ready to hear a bill that would end the exemption to the state’s indoor smoking ban enjoyed for years by Rhode Island’s two casinos, effective immediately. Then an eleventh-hour amendment opened a new loophole that still left workers at risk. The legislation that passed both the Senate and the House allowed casinos to continue permitting smoking in “pari mutual smoking lounges” — without requiring them to follow the same rules that apply to every other smoking lounge in the state. 
What does that even mean? It could be the entire gaming floor, or any other gimmick that lets casinos get around the law and keep workers in smoke-filled areas. Only the Lincoln casino has such a smoking lounge right now, but nothing stops the opening of one in Tiverton. 










This isn’t just my story. Hundreds of casino workers — dealers to back office staff — face this daily exposure. 


If workers are still breathing secondhand smoke, then we haven’t closed the loophole yet. The goal of this legislation was to ensure no casino worker inhaled toxic air at work, but this loophole allows casinos to keep doing just that. The vision of the overall bill was right, but this last-minute amendment gutted that. Suddenly workers like me found themselves again forced to work in smoke-filled areas even when the law says they’re supposed to be smokefree. I can tell you exactly how we’ll know when we’ve succeeded: when I can go to work, breathe freely, and not carry a nebulizer just to get through my shift.
Secondhand smoke doesn’t respect boundaries or stay put in one section of a building. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) — the professionals who design ventilation systems — says, “There is currently no available or reasonably anticipated ventilation or air cleaning system that can adequately control and significantly reduce the health risks of [secondhand smoke] to an acceptable level.”
These lounges are just the modern-day version of airplane smoking sections which thankfully were abandoned in the past. They were never about safety. They were about protecting smoking profits at the expense of workers’ lives. It wasn’t acceptable to poison flight attendants, and it’s not acceptable now.
Gov. Dan McKee signed the casino smoking restrictions legislation into law on Wednesday, July 2. Even with its limited protections, the new casino “nonsmoking policy” won’t take effect until January 1, 2027. That means casino workers are expected to gamble on their health and breathe toxic secondhand smoke for at least 18 more months, and we’re paying with our lives. Delaying protections until 2027 sends a message that our health is negotiable. It shouldn’t be. 
I am so grateful to the workers, advocates, and legislators (including my state representative, Rep. Teresa Tanzi and House Speaker Joe Shekarchi) who pushed for these smoking restrictions, but the job isn’t done. We won’t stop fighting until lawmakers close this loophole and all workers are fully protected. Casino employees deserve the same right to clean air that bartenders, servers and every other Rhode Island employee already enjoys.
We’ve waited long enough. Lawmakers did the hard part by making this a priority. Now it’s time to finish what they started — and finally get it right. Our lungs can’t wait 18 more months.

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Virginia Democrats have brokered many deals during his soon-ending four-year term, but have also frequently been at odds on policy issues, reflected most recently in the legislature’s rejection of several of the governor’s appointments to Virginia’s governing boards and commissions.
Virginia law gives governors the power to appoint and remove people to these groups. Like his predecessors, Youngkin has appointed hundreds of people to serve on roughly 300 public commissions and boards. 
Over the past year, Senate Democrats have rejected 30 of Youngkin’s appointments to boards and commissions, primarily to the Board of Education and governing boards at Virginia’s public higher education institutions. That is three times as many appointees as the legislature blocked during former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration, which ended in 2022.
Senate Democrats sue over Youngkin appointees kept on college boards

Now, the board appointments process is being debated publicly and will soon play out in the Fairfax County Courthouse, as officials decide whether the rejected appointees can still serve.
To better understand how the process works, the Mercury spoke with two professors from the University of Richmond and Virginia Commonwealth University about the state laws girding up gubernatorial appointment confirmations.
 How may someone be appointed to a governing board or commission?

A candidate can be considered through two methods: self-application or nomination by someone else. 
Self-application would require the candidate to consider their area of interest and then complete an application through a web portal managed by the Office of Secretary of the Commonwealth.

“It’s prestigious, it’s a lot of work, and that’s not everybody’s cup of tea,” said Carl Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond. 
Candidates may also be nominated, including by a member of the governor’s administration, and be submitted through the web portal. These roles are traditionally nonpartisan, although they can be recommended to join a board by a Democratic or Republican administration. “But my sense is that (a candidate) is often somebody who’s a pretty strong supporter of the governor,” Tobias said.
Alex Keena, associate professor of political science at VCU, said there can be several vacancies in a single year due to term limits on appointments.
“They’re about 900 appointments made in a typical year, so there’s constant vacancies. Some of those are because these positions are term-limited, or appointments last for a designated amount of time, and other times people leave,” Keena said.
Most of Virginia’s boards and commissions have specific appointment qualifications outlined in the Code of Virginia. All candidates are also required to meet the state’s Code of Conduct. Successful candidates will later be required to complete a financial disclosure statement. Board appointees are voluntary roles, with some exceptions, but are sometimes reimbursed for travel expenses. 
 What is the governor’s role?

Simply put, the governor can appoint candidates to governing boards and commissions, and even nominate them. The three types of boards and commissions are advisory, policy and supervisory.
Keena said one of his observations is that each governor’s fields of expertise have helped identify candidates for specific boards. Youngkin comes from a business background that likely informed his opinions on business or commerce-related boards. In contrast, his predecessor, Northam, had experience in the medical field and worked in the Virginia legislature as a senator and then lieutenant governor, roles that probably influenced his appointee choices. 
“I think every governor has the leeway to find appointments, however they like, (but) are certainly not bound by this application system,” Keena said. ​​

The governor also has the authority to remove a confirmed appointment from office.
Youngkin recently booted Bert Ellis from the University of Virginia for violating the state’s Code of Conduct for state boards and commissions, as well as the Board of Visitors’ Statement of Visitor Responsibilities. 
Ellis’ strong support of eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion policies at UVA triggered protests by the school’s faculty senate, student government council and campus newspaper this year, but Youngkin did not expand on the specific violations that led to his decision to remove Ellis.
According to state law, the governor may remove an appointee from office for several reasons, including failure to carry out the policies of the commonwealth, and may fill the vacancy with an appointee of their choosing, subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.
 What is the General Assembly’s role?

After the governor has compiled the list of appointments, the Secretary of the Commonwealth must provide copies of the appointees’ resumes and statements of economic interests to the chairs of the House of Delegates and the Senate Committees on Privileges and Elections.
The Senate typically takes up voting on the appointments before the House of Delegates votes. In certain instances, the lists of appointments have been updated to include additional members.
Va. lawmakers reject latest Youngkin appointees to university boards

The state code states that a joint subcommittee, composed of five members from the House and three from the Senate, will be appointed by the respective chairs to review the resumes and statements of economic interests of gubernatorial appointees.
Keena said the state law is not clear on when the General Assembly is supposed to act on appointments. Since Virginia’s legislature is part-time, lawmakers meet annually on the second Tuesday in January, typically for 30 days during odd-numbered years and 60 days during even-numbered years and usually confirm appointments during that time.
The governor can also call back lawmakers for special sessions. 
This year’s appointment confirmation process was different. Because the Senate did not recess from its 2024 General Assembly Session, the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections returned on June 9 to take up the governor’s appointments. 
By the meeting’s end, Democrats rejected eight appointees, after having rejected nine appointments during the regular session in January. 
During the June 9 meeting, Republican lawmakers questioned why the joint subcommittee had not met to review the appointees’ statements and economic interests, as required by state code. 
The Senate committee’s attorney replied he was not aware of whether the subcommittee was currently active. 
Tobias said that he believes the vetting process by lawmakers adds a “check” on the governor’s power and promotes interaction between the legislative and executive branches. Keena added that vetting candidates has historically been a practice in Virginia and across the country. 
“This is just part of checks and balances. The governor has the power to make the appointment, but it needs to be confirmed by the General Assembly, and that’s part of the legislative oversight,” Keena said.
If the General Assembly does not confirm an appointment, Virginia law states no appointment “shall enter upon, or continue in” office after being refused. They shall also not be eligible for reappointment when the General Assembly is not in session.
“If they refuse, then that’s it. You’re done,” Keena said. 
That law sets the state forSenate Democrats’ lawsuit on whether leaders at three of Virginia’s universities broke the rules by allowing rejected appointees — including former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick — to remain on their governing boards after being rejected by the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee.
The governor’s administration believes that the appointees are allowed to continue serving until the General Assembly reconvenes.
Tobias said the state code’s lack of clarity about whether the vote by the Senate Committee on Elections and Privileges represents the entire Senate has led to the contention between the governor’s administration and Senate Democrats.
“It doesn’t say House and Senate. It says General Assembly; so that’s an interesting wrinkle,” Tobias said.
 Does the legislature track the number of confirmations?

The House of Delegates does not track the number of appointment confirmations, the Mercury confirmed, nor does the Senate. 
However, both chambers keep a record of related actions taken by lawmakers.
As of July 10, the General Assembly has rejected 30 of Youngkin’s 3,523 appointments to Virginia’s boards and commissions. That’s in comparison to his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who had 10 of his 2,941 appointees blocked by the legislature.
The totals exclude cabinet and agency appointments.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Northam’s time in office began when the entire legislature was controlled by Republicans, which rejected only nine appointees; seven of those were for the Board of Regents of the James Monroe Law Office Museum and Memorial Library. However, after two years, Democrats took control of both chambers, rejecting only one appointment. 
As for Youngkin, the governor has always faced a Democratic-controlled Senate Committee over the past four years. With his help, Republicans regained control of the House at the start of his term, but lost power to Democrats in late 2023. Most of the rejections have been for public boards and commissions about K-12 education, higher education and the Virginia Parole Board.
 Are there any other legal nuances of appointment confirmations?

Yes, the experts said, but they are buried in the state code.
In the 1970s, lawmakers revised the Virginia Constitution to transfer some control of state governance from the legislature to the governor. But they also created inconsistencies regarding when appointments can begin serving on their respective boards and commissions. In many cases, appointments begin serving before they are confirmed.
“It really depends on the board,” Keena said. “There’s general state law that governs the process by which these appointments are made, and the role of the General Assembly, and each board has its own set of rules.”
One law has been revised to establish a special process that allows the governor to make recess appointments to the Board of Education, according to Keena. However, the law governing the boards of Virginia’s higher education institutions does not include specific language regarding the power to appoint someone to fill a vacancy. 
Not all of the roughly 300 boards have a special process for appointing vacancies. Keena said such a process could be added to state code due to the size of the board or commission, or the frequency of their meetings during the year.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services. 
Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well. 
“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated. 
Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.
Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.
As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners). 
The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.
An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.” 
An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall. 
“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads. 
Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.
“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

Roughly 310,000 people across Georgia are projected to lose access to health insurance by 2034 under the bill. Getty ImagesAs the dust settles in the wake of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” — the massive spending cut and tax break package signed into law early this month — it’s becoming clearer that Georgia’s health care landscape may look dramatically different in 2026.
Health insurers, providers and advocates alike are bracing for the impact that the federal budget reconciliation bill will have on health care access throughout the state over the next decade. The bill’s sweeping Medicaid cuts are expected to reduce federal health care funding in Georgia by $2.29 billion, according to data from the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF. 
In addition, roughly 310,000 people across Georgia are projected to lose access to health insurance by 2034. That number could rise to 750,000 if Congress allows enhanced tax credits for those insured through the Affordable Care Act to expire this year.
The policy changes have alarmed health policy experts, who anticipate that the bill will bring drastic changes to the U.S. health care landscape over the next decade.
“This bill was not framed as a health care reform effort, but it represents the biggest change to the health care system since the passage of the Affordable Care Act 15 years ago,” said Larry Levitt, KFF’s executive vice president for health policy. “And in effect, it amounts to what is effectively a partial repeal of the ACA, erasing a lot of its gains in health coverage.”
“The scale of the change to the health care system is staggering,” he added. “This represents the biggest rollback in federal support for health coverage ever.”
A Georgia Recorder analysis found that 45 health care facilities across 35 Georgia counties risk reducing services or closing altogether due to the bill’s spending cuts. Those facilities include hospitals, nursing homes and Planned Parenthood centers across both urban and rural parts of the state, all of which will likely face funding gaps under the budget reconciliation bill.


Rural hospitals face funding shortfall
Hospitals in rural parts of the state, many of which rely on funding from Medicaid to sustain their facilities, may be among the hardest hit health care providers under the new bill. 
That includes four hospitals in rural Georgia: Fannin Regional Hospital in Blue Ridge, Flint River Community Hospital in Montezuma, Irwin County Hospital in Ocilla and Washington County Regional Medical Center in Sandersville. Three of those hospitals are in counties represented by Republican congressmen who voted in favor of the bill, and all four border at least one county that lacks its own hospital.
HomeTown Health CEO Jimmy Lewis said he and his organization’s network of rural hospitals are bracing for the changes handed down by Washington, though they are not sure yet what the full impact will be.
“The ability to plan around the uncertainty is a nightmare,” he said. “The only thing we can tell [hospitals] on this particular occasion is that you just must be prepared for the most draconian cuts imaginable as we go forward.” 
For the rural hospitals in his network, Lewis said, government funding makes up the vast majority of their income. Roughly 60% of payments come from Medicare and Medicare Advantage, with Medicaid payments making up another 20%. Private insurers and self-funded payers make up only a small portion of rural hospital incomes.
“That’s a real problem, because Medicaid typically pays 85.6% of cost,” he said. “Medicare pays, at best, about cost, and any variation that occurs to that, for example, self pay, typically pays seven to 10% of cost. So over a normal matrix, we start out losing money.” 
“It’s not uncommon at all for rural hospitals to operate with three to 10 days’ cash with a $30 to $40 million operation,” he added.
And when hospitals are forced to reduce services or close entirely, Lewis said, the effects ripple out into the entire community, forcing residents to drive further to access care and depleting local job opportunities. Labor and delivery unit closures, which have been on the rise nationwide since 2020, often serve as a bellwether for the broader impact of hospital closures in rural areas, Lewis added.
“We closed about 14 OB units in the last five to 10 years,” Lewis said. “That’s a real problem. Not only is that a health care delivery system for babies, but it’s an economic development system for the community. And when you lose it, you lose economic development opportunities in a big time fashion.”
The federal bill includes a $50 billion fund aimed at helping offset some of the costs for providers in rural areas, and Georgia’s Department of Community Health board voted to increase Medicaid funding to hospitals by $2 billion in an emergency meeting last month, a move that must be approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. But experts are skeptical that the funds will go far enough to prevent hospital closures in the long term.
The rural health fund “will certainly help in rural communities, but it won’t fully compensate for the cuts, especially since it’s temporary and the cuts are permanent,” said KFF’s Levitt.
Tax credit expirations leave Georgia families hanging
The expiration of ACA enhanced premium tax credits, which were first introduced in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, poses another barrier for Georgia residents seeking health care access. 
The credits currently help subsidize health care premiums for families with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty line (which comes out to $62,600 for a single-person household and $128,600 for a household of 4), and are associated with record high ACA enrollment levels. In Georgia, which saw ACA enrollment triple between 2020 and 2024, 96% of enrollees use advanced premium tax credits to cover some or all of their health care costs.
The credits are set to expire at the end of this year, and Congress has yet to renew them, meaning families may have to start paying higher premiums for health care coverage as early as January 2026.
Data from the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, estimates that Georgia families could end up paying an average of $528 more per year, which amounts to an 85% increase on health care premiums. Residents of some counties are projected to spend up to $900 more annually.
Health care advocates worry that the higher premiums will result in fewer Georgia residents obtaining coverage, with some families being priced out of the health insurance market entirely. Georgia already has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. 
“Because Georgia has not expanded Medicaid, we have more low-income individuals enrolled in the marketplace or Georgia Access than most states,” said Whitney Griggs, the director of health policy at Georgians for a Healthy Future, a patient advocacy group. “Those folks are going to feel the pain of these premium increases the most.” 
Though certain parts of the budget reconciliation bill likely won’t impact taxpayers until 2027 or beyond, higher insurance premiums may debut as soon as January 2026.
As a result, state lawmakers will likely have to choose between directing more state funds towards health care programs or allowing service cuts to take effect, with health policy experts hoping that the state’s multibillion dollar budget surplus could be used to help supplement the federal funding gap.
“We have been operating with a budget surplus that is above and beyond our undesignated reserves,” said Leah Chan, director of health justice at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. “So our state has clearly shown that we are setting our revenue estimates very conservatively, and there might be an opportunity to use more of the state revenue that we’re receiving to meet people’s basic needs.”

A new study sheds lights on the increasing loss of obstetric services across America. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)At least a quarter of hospitals in seven states closed their obstetric services between 2010 and 2022, according to a new study in the journal Health Affairs. And in six states, more than 60% of hospitals lacked obstetrics by 2022.
Using data from the American Hospital Association and federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the researchers analyzed obstetric services at short-term acute care hospitals between 2010 and 2022.
The study included 4,964 hospitals.


On Tuesday, July 15, at 7 p.m. the Newport City Council holds a special meeting at Newport City Hall to consider a resolution supporting the continued operation of the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center at Newport Hospital. The resolution acknowledges that Newport Hospital’s new CEO “faces the critical challenge of advocating for the preservation of essential healthcare services” as its owner Brown University Health is confronting budget constraints.


Rural states saw the most profound losses. The states with the highest percentage of all hospitals lacking obstetrics by 2022 were: North Dakota (73%), Oklahoma (63%), West Virginia (62%), Louisiana (60%), South Dakota (60%) and Mississippi (60%).
The study sheds further light on the nation’s growing maternity health care deserts. At 18.6 per 100,000 live births, the U.S. has a maternal mortality rate far higher than other high-income nations. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 80% of maternal deaths in the U.S. are preventable.
The “steady march of closures” has been an ongoing problem, said Katy Kozhimannil, University of Minnesota professor and lead author of the study.
Hospital leaders and experts have warned that Congress’ Medicaid cuts could have a ripple effect, leading to many hospitals no longer able to afford their labor and delivery units, which are expensive to maintain.
“Those programs are a primary source of support for maternity care,” Kozhimannil said. “Without changes to maternity care financing and organization, I expect that the trends that we have seen over the past couple of decades will likely continue.”
A dozen states saw a quarter or more losses of obstetric services among hospitals in rural counties, the study found.

Across rural counties in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, close to half of hospitals — 46% — lost obstetrics between 2010 and 2022.
Those two states saw the highest percentage of hospitals losing obstetrics, followed by West Virginia (about 43%), Florida (40%) and Iowa (nearly 40%).
Along with Washington, D.C., urban counties in four states — Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma  and Rhode Island — saw at least a quarter of hospitals lose obstetrics.
By 2022, two-thirds of rural hospitals in eight states (Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia) were without obstetric services.
Three states — Delaware, Utah and Vermont — had no obstetric losses between 2010 and 2022, the authors wrote.

It’s no secret that bipartisanship is in short supply these days in state politics and that fact makes it especially tragic, as has happened recently at the state legislature, when opportunities for finding common ground are casually and cynically trashed.
See, for example, an important bill designed to prevent people from being victimized by revenge porn that passed the state House 113-0.
Unfortunately, when it got to the Senate, Republican leaders packed the bill with several right-wing culture war agenda items – including provisions to ban school books and deny health care to transgender people.
A similar thing happened to a bipartisan bill designed to target squatters on private property. It was amended to prevent local governments from regulating puppy mills.
The amendments forced Gov. Stein, rightfully, to veto both bills.
The bottom line: North Carolinians deserve better. If GOP leaders want to advance a conservative policy agenda, they should have the courage to let their proposals rise and fall on their own merit without hijacking important, consensus legislation.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)The Maine Legislature largely opted to maintain the status quo regarding campaign finance regulations this year, rejecting attempts to expand clean elections, require more transparency into who is spending in elections and ban direct corporate contributions to candidates.  
The most common reasons cited by lawmakers, who voted down many of these bills in committee before the proposals even reached the chambers, were the tight budget year and that the plans didn’t get to the root causes of money in politics.
“We really took this as that campaign finance reform was not a priority at all during this legislative session in a time where money and politics is rampant and at an all time high,” said Al Cleveland, advocacy director for Democracy Maine, a collaboration of nonpartisan organizations focused on making government more equitable.
Before the Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted down one of the bills that sought to require the disclosure of the original source of what’s frequently referred to as “dark money,” discussion illuminated a sense of resignation on this topic held by lawmakers.
“I don’t think all the laws that we pass are going to change money in politics,” said Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin) during the April 16 work session. “It’s the way of life now. I wish it wasn’t.” 
Rep. Anne Graham (D-North Yarmouth) offered a similar view, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2010, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which overturned century-old campaign finance restrictions by allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited funds on elections.
“The reality is,” Graham said, “until Congress repeals Citizens United, we’re faced with this dilemma.” 
The rejection of these bills comes at a time when there is a strong appetite for change among the public. Maine voters overwhelmingly passed laws in the past two general elections to place stricter regulations on money in politics, with both including measures aimed at overturning Citizens United in different ways. However, those changes have so far been blocked as legal battles play out in the courts. 
On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit sided with the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits against the 2023 law, which prohibited foreign government spending in elections. The judge ruled the law is likely unconstitutional and affirmed the district court’s preliminary injunction. 
Maine Legislature eyes campaign finance reforms as courts weigh voter-backed referenda

“I think our state lawmakers are often left unsure how to handle the big, big issues and so then they fear that the smaller reforms won’t be as effective as all their dreams might be,” Cleveland said. “But, if we’re going to ever get to a place where we can truly instigate true campaign finance reform and really reduce the money on politics, we need to have all of these different policies in place already.”
With restrictions on the types of bills that can be introduced during the second regular session that begins next year, and given that lawmakers already considered and rejected campaign finance-related proposals, it is now unlikely for major change to be reconsidered, at least legislatively, until the next Legislature in 2027. 
What passed
Two bills on this topic did pass, though offer only small tweaks within the existing campaign finance landscape. 
LD 9, submitted by Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) on behalf of the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, raises penalties for what are considered “straw” donations, which are already illegal in Maine but difficult to detect. These are donations funneled to support or oppose a specific political group or candidate through an intermediary, however the name of the original donor is not disclosed. 
For example, in November 2023, the commission completed an enforcement proceeding regarding a $150,000 donation from Alpine Initiatives through an intermediary to the Maine Democratic Party. At that time, the actual donor was not disclosed. 
This new law will also require that the name of a person or group who paid more than $500 for a campaign text expressly advocating for or against a candidate has to be included in the text so the public knows who is behind it. 
The other bill, LD 390, sponsored by Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland), levels the playing field for enrolled and unenrolled candidates when it comes to qualifying contributions.
Because unenrolled candidates don’t have primary races, they’d previously only had the general election period to reach the cap on funds they’re allowed to accept from any one person, whereas enrolled candidates had two periods due to primaries and therefore the opportunity to raise more. 
While the bill initially sought to raise the contribution limit of independent candidates, the version passed took the approach of instead providing both types of candidates two election periods. 
Anticipating some people would argue the bill increases the role of money in politics, Brenner said when presenting it to the committee, “I agree that money in politics is a concern. But, within the system we have, the rules must be fair.”
What failed
Meanwhile, bills that sought to expand clean elections, ban corporate contributions to candidates and require more transparency into who is spending in elections all failed. 










It seems like the one thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is keeping the current dysfunctional system in place.


– Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford)


Clean Elections
Maine was a pioneer in public campaign financing but has rejected recent attempts to further expand clean elections. 
In 2000, Maine became one of two states to implement a clean elections model of campaign finance reform, marking the first time candidates for statewide offices — governor, state senator and state representative — were able to fully fund their campaigns with public money. 
This session, three separate attempts to expand the program to more offices failed. 
LD 118, sponsored by Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) and bipartisan co-sponsors, would have allowed candidates for district attorney and sheriff to participate. Last legislative session, lawmakers passed a narrower bill to allow candidates for just district attorney to participate, but Gov. Janet Mills did not sign the proposal or any of the bills the Legislature enacted when lawmakers reconvened for the final day of the session in 2024.
“We have lost ground,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star, “and I think there is a sense of fatalistic capitulation to the dysfunctional status quo, which is prevailing in the Legislature these days.”
Meanwhile, LD 1787 had initially proposed adding district attorney, sheriff and county commissioners to the program. But lawmakers removed those sections and instead passed the bill solely as a measure to change the amount of “seed money” gubernatorial candidates can receive, which is private money that candidates can raise to get their campaign off the ground and qualify for clean elections.
Efforts to expand Maine clean elections reckon with currently inadequate program funding

LD 454, sponsored by Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot), would have added candidates for secretary of state and attorney general to the program, contingent on those constitutional officers being changed to popularly elected positions. 
Maine is an outlier in having its Legislature appoint constitutional officers and state auditors. All of the bills that sought to switch the system to allowing the public to decide through a direct popular election failed this year, so LD 454 ultimately couldn’t become law either.
Some Democrats said that they would have supported the switch if the offices were elected through ranked-choice voting, a system Maine voters passed in 2016 to allow voters to rank political candidates for governor, state legislature and Congress by preference. 
Meanwhile, most Republicans would likely be against having such offices elected through ranked-choice voting. Separately, the Legislature rejected a bill proposed by Republicans this year that sought to do away with ranked-choice voting altogether. 
Baldacci told Maine Morning Star he’s interested in introducing a bill in the future that incorporates all three components — popular election, clean elections and ranked-choice voting — but he doesn’t see that as an option until the next Legislature, if he is reelected in 2026. Given that the general proposal was already rejected this year, he sees it as unlikely legislative leadership would allow him to introduce the three-pronged approach next year. 
The budget passed this year provided what has become a typical $3 million allocation for clean elections, however LD 1787 had originally called for increasing funding to $3.5 million, which Cleveland from Democracy Maine described as crucial not only to expand the program but to ensure multiple candidates are able to access the fund each election. 
“We’re really concerned about the Clean Elections fund not being sustainable,” Cleveland said. 
The Maine Ethics Commission has raised concern about allocations not being enough if more than just two gubernatorial candidates run under the program in 2026. 
So far only one candidate is running under the program, current Republican Sen. James Libby. Bennett, who is leaving the Republican party to run as an independent for governor, said he chose not to run under clean elections because of fear that there wouldn’t be sufficient funding. 
“In terms of increasing the Clean Elections fund and expanding clean elections with what the Legislature is going to have to deal with all the federal budget cuts, there is probably not going to be a lot of political room to make that happen,” Cleveland said, referring to President Donald Trumps’ spending bill, “but we will continue advocating and educating about it.”
Who can spend and who knows about it
In 2021, Maine passed a law that made several changes to campaign finance law, including banning direct corporate contributions to candidates and leadership PACs, which are controlled by legislators. But lawmakers repealed the law shortly after in 2023, with some supporters arguing it was unfair to businesses and others that the law lacked clarity.
This year, LD 1350 attempted to reinstate the part of the law that banned corporate contributions, but it was unanimously rejected by the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee and both chambers later followed suit. 
Currently, 23 states completely prohibit corporations from contributing to political campaigns, and federal law prohibits such direct contributions in connection to federal elections. 
Bennett reintroduced a bill to increase transparency regarding who spends money in elections, but it died again this year, also after being unanimously rejected by the committee.  
The bill, LD 951, would have required political action committees that receive contributions of at least $10,000 from a single contributor and spend more than $50,000 in Maine elections to disclose the original source of those funds. It was based on a similar law in Arizona. 
Donors frequently obscure their political activity by giving to a politically oriented nonprofit, which then donates money to a candidate. Ordinarily, campaign disclosure laws would only list the nonprofit as the source of the money.
Maine Citizens for Clean Elections supported this measure, with attorney John Brautigam pointing the committee to polls that show Americans of all political persuasions overwhelmingly support disclosure of such donations. But the Maine Education Association, Maine Conservation Voters, Planned Parenthood and other groups were opposed, arguing the requirements in LD 951 go too far and threaten the personal safety contributors. 
“It seems like the one thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is keeping the current dysfunctional system in place,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star. “Any one of these things by themselves won’t do it, but we do need a different approach.”

Mike Johnson (R-LA) celebrates with fellow House Republicans during an enrollment ceremony of H.R. 1, the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act at the U.S. Capitol on July 3, 2025, in Washington, D.C. The House passed the sweeping tax and spending bill after winning over fiscal hawks and moderate Republicans. The bill makes permanent President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increases spending on defense and immigration enforcement, and temporarily cuts taxes on tips, while at the same time cutting funding for Medicaid, food assistance for the poor, and clean energy. It also raises the nation's debit limit by $5 trillion. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)When Michelle Lawrence heard about the Medicaid cuts included in the Republican tax and spending bill signed into law on July 4, it felt like “a punch to the gut.”
“I laugh, because if I don’t laugh, I cry,” she said.
Lawrence, who lives in Henniker, was diagnosed with a chronic form of cancer called T-cell lymphocytic leukemia 16 years ago. She said she lost her job about five years ago because the cancer was making it too difficult for her to work. And in losing her job, she lost her health insurance because she couldn’t afford COBRA coverage or anything on the marketplace.
“So I applied for Medicaid, which has been a major lifeline for me,” she continued. “That has enabled me and a lot of other cancer patients like me to be able to access the treatment needed in the past few years. I’m here. I’m alive and a contributing member of society. … Without Medicaid, I wouldn’t be able to afford my treatments or go to the doctor.”
Lawrence works 40 hours a month at a nonprofit assisting people with disabilities. Between the symptoms of her cancer and the side effects of her treatment, she can’t work any more than that, she said. But the “big beautiful bill” adds a work requirement to Medicaid that requires people to work 80 hours per month to receive coverage.
“Those 40 hours a month are hard for me to do. I have had cancer for 16 years,” she said. “I can’t create a healthier Michelle that’s going to be able to work 80 hours. If I could, I would have by now, because I’d rather be working. No one wants to be sick and no one wants to be unable to work.”
The bill includes exceptions to the work requirements for “serious and complex medical conditions,” but it’s still unclear if that exemption will apply to all cancer patients, just some cancer patients, or no cancer patients at all. Lawrence said she asked the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, the agency responsible for administering Medicaid in the state, but officials there didn’t have an answer for her. 
“And that’s the scary part,” Lawrence said. “It feels like the Wild, Wild West. So we passed this bill, and now it’s left up to interpretation, and I don’t think that’s reasonable, because what am I supposed to do? Like, just carry on and wait to find out if or if not I get kicked off? Should I be planning a funeral instead of my next doctor’s appointment?”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by the Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, affects huge swaths of the federal government’s services, budget, and tax code. The bill extends a set of tax cuts enacted in a signature piece of legislation from the first Trump administration, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And it makes deep cuts to social services in order to partially pay for the tax breaks, though independent bipartisan analysis from the Congressional Budget Office still projects the bill will increase the federal deficit. The bill also includes a number of other tax and unrelated provisions. The effective date of those provisions varies, with some changes — such as some of the Medicaid cuts — set to take effect after the 2026 midterm elections.
The cuts will leave states with tough decisions about whether to cover the new funding holes with state money — a big challenge for states like New Hampshire that are in tight budget cycles of their own — or cut the programs.
Asked about her thoughts on the bill and whether the state should pay to fill those gaps, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte provided a statement to the Bulletin: “We are evaluating the impact of the recently passed federal legislation on New Hampshire. I disagree with federal reductions to SNAP and Medicaid benefits and will work closely with DHHS to protect our most vulnerable citizens.” 
New Hampshire’s delegation dissents
The bill has been lambasted by Democrats, including the four members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation, all Democrats who voted against the bill.
“What this president calls the big beautiful bill, I call the big beautiful betrayal of the American people,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said during a press conference Tuesday. “This bill takes food and health care away from seniors and families to give trillions of dollars more to corporations and to the wealthiest.”
First District Rep. Chris Pappas, who represents the eastern half of the state, called the bill “a disaster for the American people.”
“It’s a cruel bill that contains deep cuts that are going to impact our families, our neighbors, all across the state of New Hampshire,” he said. “This is decidedly unpopular here in New Hampshire … But the fact is, our colleagues across the aisle, it’s not that they didn’t hear it, it’s that they didn’t listen to what people were actually saying.”
Pappas is vacating his seat in the House of Representatives at the end of this term in order to run for Senate in 2026. Scott Brown, one of his Republican opponents in that election, did not respond to the Bulletin’s request for an interview, but he has publicly targeted Pappas for his vote against the bill, writing on social media, “Pappas will side with left-wing partisans in Congress over the people of New Hampshire and the tax certainty in the budget reconciliation package.”
“I proudly support President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill because working families deserve a break,” Brown wrote in a separate post, pointing specifically to provisions that eliminate taxes on tips and overtime.
Tax cuts felt by the rich and the deficit
An analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based fiscal think tank, shows the bill’s tax benefits are heavily skewed to America’s wealthiest. The richest fifth of Americans are set to receive roughly 72% of the net tax benefits in the bill in 2026, while the middle fifth would receive roughly 10%. The poorest fifth would receive less than 1% of the benefits, according to the analysis. Put in other terms, the richest 1% of Americans would get about 22% of the bill’s tax benefits in 2026.
In New Hampshire, the top 1% of households are expected to receive 16% of the bill’s tax benefits, according to the same think tank’s analysis. Those households, which earn more than $894,699 annually, are expected to pay $59,170 less in taxes over the course of 2026, on average. The poorest 20% of New Hampshire households, on the other hand, will receive 1% of the bill’s tax benefits. Those households, which earn less than $37,000, are expected to get $200 in annual savings across 2026.
Many fiscal conservatives embraced the tax cut portion of the bill. Much of the bill’s tax policy is an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a New Hampshire-based conservative think tank, championed those changes and was happy to see them extended.
“To the extent that One Big Beautiful Bill Act makes permanent the 2017 tax rates and does some expansion in terms of business tax deductions … that’s good,” Drew Cline, the organization’s executive director, said. “Those 2017 changes were designed to achieve two main goals: One was to simplify the code, and the other was to stimulate growth. So to the extent that the new bill furthers those goals, those are positive.”
Cline acknowledged that the bill’s tax benefits primarily go to the wealthiest Americans, but he dismissed that as a concern “because the rich are the ones who pay the vast majority of income taxes” already. He argued that the U.S. tax code is currently very progressive, so any tax benefits would be felt by those paying the most taxes already. (Other think tanks disagree on the U.S. tax code’s progressivity; the Brookings Institution, for example, argues the tax code is less progressive relative to peer countries including the U.K., Canada, Spain, Greece, Japan, Germany, and Australia, among others, and is becoming less progressive over time.)
Still, Cline isn’t entirely on board with the bill. He’s not a fan of how tax exemptions for tips and overtime included in the bill will complicate the tax code, which he believes should be simplified. More importantly, Cline is worried about the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office predicts the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit across the coming decade.
“The bigger story here is that we are spending and we are borrowing at crisis levels when we don’t have a crisis,” he said. “And that is not sustainable.”
The biggest cut to Medicaid in U.S. history
The bill cuts Medicaid nearly $1 trillion over the next decade through a number of different provisions. In New Hampshire specifically, the bill is expected to revoke 18% of New Hampshire’s federal baseline spending for Medicaid, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s $3 billion over 10 years. Medicaid, which is funded and operated jointly by state and federal governments, covers roughly 186,000 people in New Hampshire, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
One of the biggest changes to Medicaid is the new work requirements. Opponents of work requirements argue that a vast majority of Medicaid enrollees are already working, that the paperwork and bureaucracy required to prove eligibility is too burdensome for states to do effectively, and that many people — like Lawrence, the cancer patient — are not only too sick to meet the requirement but often not well enough to complete the bureaucratic process of proving they can’t work.
Work requirements have been unsuccessfully attempted at the state level a few times, including in New Hampshire. In 2018, the state enacted a law mandating Medicaid enrollees work 100 hours a month to receive coverage. However, about one month after the rule went into effect in 2019, only about 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement complied and documented their hours. At that point, then-Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, intervened and paused the new system before the remaining roughly 17,000 people lost coverage. The state had spent more than $130,000 in outreach efforts to inform recipients of the requirements and to teach them how to complete the eligibility paperwork. Arkansas and Georgia have also tried to implement work requirements. Arkansas had similar issues until a federal judge intervened and blocked the law.
The cuts also come at the same time as a number of changes to Medicaid at the state level. The New Hampshire state budget signed into law in June increases prescription co-pays and charges some enrollees premiums. The budget, which was passed before the federal bill, also enacts work requirements. However, details on the state work requirements have yet to be ironed out and need to be submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It’s also unclear how the state rule would work in relation to the new federal requirements.
U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, a former governor who oversaw New Hampshire’s expansion of Medicaid in 2014 before being elected to the Senate, called the bill “the largest cut to Medicaid we have seen in our nation’s history.”
Shaheen, her colleague in the Senate, compared the cuts to Republicans’ failed efforts to  repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017.
“We celebrated (in 2017) because we knew that millions of Americans were going to continue to have access to health care,” she said. “Our colleagues in the Senate and the administration are celebrating (now) because millions of Americans are going to lose their access to health care.”
Cuts to SNAP
Laura Milliken,  executive director of NH Hunger Solutions, a statewide advocacy group working to address hunger in New Hampshire, said the bill “is just a world of bad.”
The bill includes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps low-income families pay for food. Those cuts are expected to cause 22.3 million families in the U.S. to lose some or all of their SNAP benefits.
“It just is so, so unnecessary and cruel at a time that we’re all feeling like everything’s expensive,” Milliken said. “People are having difficulty affording their housing, their child care, their medication. It seems like the moment to strengthen our programs that protect low-income folks and not to cut them, and this is such a drastic change in the program.”
The bill passes off much of the administrative cost of SNAP to states, which may or may not be willing or able to take on those costs. The bill also reduces benefits for some recipients by restricting what factors can be taken into account when deciding how much a family receives. The bill also caps future increases to SNAP at the rate of inflation. It bans many migrants (specifically refugees and asylees) from participating in the program (people in the country without legal status were already ineligible). And work requirements will become stricter.
“People are scared,” Milliken said. “People are thinking, ‘Boy, I’m barely making ends meet right now, what am I going to do if my SNAP benefits are cut?’”
Milliken said many of the food pantries in New Hampshire are afraid they won’t be able to keep up with the increased demand they expect to see as the provisions of the bill go into effect. She also noted that because SNAP automatically qualifies kids for free and reduced-price school meals, which in turn qualify schools for federal aid, the changes will likely impact other programs as well.
Milliken said NH Hunger Solutions hopes to work with state officials to try to mitigate the effects the bill will have on food insecurity in New Hampshire.
Other provisions
The omnibus bill also has a myriad of unrelated provisions that touch nearly every segment of the federal government.
For example, the bill eliminates the IRS direct file program, which sought to help Americans file their taxes for free. The bill also limits the dollar amount of student loans graduate and professional students can take out. It also eliminates regulations for nursing home staffing requirements, revokes Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, and eliminates several tax credits meant to encourage environmentally friendly practices.

(Photo courtesy of the office of South Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz)U.S. Democratic representatives characterized the state-run immigrant detention center in the Everglades as a cruel and wasteful political stunt following a guided tour Saturday.
Members of Congress and state legislators who visited the site described seeing bugs on mattresses, toilets and showers that lacked privacy, small food portions, and temperatures between 83 and 85 degrees in the air-conditioned areas.
“There are really disturbing, vile conditions, and this place needs to be shut the hell down,” said South Florida U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of the detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
The South Florida Democrat said 32 men slept in each of the cages with bed bunks and three sinks attached to the toilets. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced hundreds of people started arriving on July 2.
Democrats labeled the tour as sanitized because they couldn’t speak to any of the detainees or staff. Detainees have told the Miami Herald and CBS News that they hadn’t been able to shower, the toilets didn’t flush, and that the food had maggots.
Anna Eskamani, a state representative from Orlando, said Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, led the tour. The agency is in charge of the site.
“It was just incredibly dystopian, and a lot of lack of clarity on what rules and procedures are actually being followed as it pertains to those being detained, as it pertains to what their status is,” Eskamani said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
Eskamani is one of five Democrats in the Florida Legislature suing the state after they weren’t allowed to enter the detention center on July 3. FDEM invited Congress members and state lawmakers on Wednesday for the tour Saturday, when U.S. representatives said they were already planning on conducting an oversight visit.
Meanwhile, Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, defended conditions at the detention center during a press conference in Tampa on Saturday, saying it was held to the same standards as federal facilities. However, she sidestepped specific questions about the site because it is state-run.
“Any issues that were there have been addressed,” she said. “It’s a fantastic resource for us to be able to utilize in order for a detention facility to repatriate people back home to their home countries.”
Governors in five Republican states have told Noem they want to build detention centers like the one in the Everglades, Noem said. She refused to say which governors expressed interest.
Spring Hill Republican Sen. Baise Ingoglia, an ally of Gov. Ron DeSantis, also visited on Saturday. The senator, possibly in line as DeSantis’ pick as chief financial officer, wrote on X that Democrats’ rhetoric about the detention center didn’t match reality.
“I actually laid down in one of the beds and it was really comfortable, Ingoglia wrote. “So, any complaints about squalor conditions is nothing more than bullsh*t and political theater.”

Promises made.
Promises kept.

“Alligator Alcatraz” is the name Florida’s Republican leadership have give to the camp.
Despite the poor conditions Democrats described, South Florida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said the detention center shouldn’t be compared to a concentration camp. Moskowitz served as the head of FDEM for two years under DeSantis.
“Listen, it is as bad as it can be, but it is not a concentration camp, and people should not use Holocaust references to describe what’s going on behind us,” he told reporters following the tour.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
Elon Musk fumes tax and spending bill is a ‘disgusting abomination’; GOP senators shrug

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
North Carolina US Sen. Thom Tillis announces retirement after drawing Trump wrath

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

But for some, like The Ohio Newsroom, the mandate is statewide. Reporters use their resources to make sure Ohioans know their neighbors, along with the residents of far-off towns they may not know.
“To me, it’s really important that people in Columbus hear about what’s going on in Bucyrus, or that people in Cleveland hear what’s happening in Findlay,” said Clare Roth, managing editor of The Ohio Newsroom. “We’re all connected, we’re all members of this state … and I think that’s an essential service that public radio does very well.”
The Ohio Newsroom started three years ago with help from a Corporation for Public Broadcasting grant. For Roth, as well as other journalists in the state, the coverage that they do means allowing Ohioans to be able to hear themselves in the news.
“That representation matters and means something, for people to hear folks from their area on the radio and to hear stories about the places that they’re from,” Roth said.
Public media workers in Ohio are worried about an ongoing effort to claw back federal funds, including more than $1 billion for Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Funding from the CPB goes to local stations who distribute NPR and PBS, and provides grant funding for projects and local programming.

The U.S. House already approved what’s called a rescissions bill, which Republican leadership and the Trump administration has said is cost-cutting measure, this time for about $9 billion in reductions to foreign aid, along with public media on the homefront. It’s now in the hands of the U.S. Senate, facing a July 18 deadline.
 Repercussions
Many public media outlets in Ohio have enlisted the help of their supporters, listeners, and readers to reach out to their federal representatives and senators and urge push back against the bill.
“I just really believe that public media needs to belong to the public and should be accountable to the public,” said Kevin Martin, president and CEO of Ideastream Public Media.
The station actually contains many stations, including the WKSU for NPR and local coverage, PBS station WVIZ.

Ideastream is also helps provides livestreams of legislative sessions, committee meetings, press conferences and even the Ohio Supreme Court’s oral arguments through The Ohio Channel.
Martin has memories of similar attempts to cut federal public media funding, having worked as a distributor of community service grants for the CPB himself.
“I can not remember a Republican president that hasn’t had public media zeroed out in their budget,” Martin said.
But the bipartisan support for public media has always won the day. With the new administration, however, Martin and other Ohio public media leaders are seeing a different environment.
“Every member of Congress, when they vote, it’s a calculation, and I would say nowadays it’s about the repercussions of their vote,” Martin said.
Local media could see its own repercussions with the budget cuts as they stand, cuts that could not only impact the amount of content the stations can produce, but also their ability to provide things like emergency alerts.
“There’s a very well-established infrastructure for emergency alerts that are made possible through public media,” said Luke Dennis, general manager of WYSO in Yellow Springs. “Public media is, in many places, the only media, so when the internet doesn’t work, or you can’t afford it at all, it matters to be able to have that service.”
WYSO recently established itself as an independent news station apart from Antioch College, and they’re working to grow on their own. The station was able to raise about $3.5 million in about nine months “because the community got excited about WYSO being independent,” according to Dennis.
But the CPB cuts could mean a loss of about $300,000 for WYSO.

“It will force us to quickly adapt and approve the plan b budget that we have in our back pocket, and we don’t want to do that because we’re already working lean and mean,” Dennis said.
The message from public media leaders to listeners and to lawmakers is unified: the work they do serves their hyper-local community, and national services like PBS make a difference.
“I often ask people if they grew up watching Sesame Street or Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, because that reminds us that education is a core tenet of public media,” Dennis said.
Dennis and Martin said supporters are sending emails and making phone calls by the thousands in support of public media.
Martin said Ideastream would “probably need some consolidation” if the cuts are made, but he and Roth both see the problem at a higher level than station-to-station cuts.
“I worry about the system as a whole,” Roth said. “I know what a different it can make to tell stories and to really get to the richness of Ohio life, and I hate to think of that being curtailed anywhere.”
 Ohio’s congressional delegation
All of Ohio’s U.S. House Democrats voted against the cuts, with the exception of Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was absent from the vote for medical reasons.
Beatty told the Capital Journal in a statement that she strongly opposes the legislation and urged her colleagues “to keep public radio and public broadcast well-funded, free and accessible.”
Only one of Ohio’s Republican House members, Rep. Mike Turner, voted against the rescissions bill.
Turner did not respond to the Capital Journal’s request for comment, but Democratic representatives were universal in their support for public media in Ohio, particularly it’s ability to give access to rural and low-income areas.
“For families who can’t afford access to paid cable or streaming options, easy access to unbiased local media that keeps them well-informed is a vital lifeline that is helping to educate future generations,” according to Rep. Marcy Kaptur.
Kaptur also said “cancelling Elmo won’t fix the cost-of-living crisis,” and Rep. Shontel Brown said the bill isn’t about saving money, as Republican leaders claim.

“Public broadcasting is a tiny sliver of the federal budget, and for decades, the American people have received a terrific return on this investment,” Brown said in a statement. “The fact is, if we don’t invest in educational programming for children, there is no guarantee that the commercial media will.”
Rep. Emilia Sykes said the proposed cuts “would have a massively negative impact” on her district, and cutting the funding to local stations “will be a disservice to our communities, as well as those across the country that aren’t part of bigger media markets.”
Lawmakers who responded to questions about their votes on the bill emphasized the public interest the threat to public media funding has garnered.
“We’ve gotten calls from so many constituents who say this is a really big deal to them,” said Rep. Greg Landsman, in a statement. “Cutting over a billion dollars would hit small communities, and we know these are good programs that serve real people.”
GOP Rep. Warren Davidson declined to comment for the story, but posted screenshots of NPR headlines on racism and gender inequality, along with a PBS headline on implicit bias and a headline from an unnamed media source mentioning NPR’s use of audio from an abortion in a news report to his official X account on June 12.
“This type of ‘coverage’ shouldn’t get a cent of taxpayer dollars,” Davidson’s post read. “Defund NPR and PBS.”
The Capital Journal did not receive responses from the other Ohio members who voted to approve the cuts: U.S. Reps. David Taylor, Troy Balderson, Bob Latta, Jim Jordan, David Joyce, Mike Carey and Max Miller.
In a video posted to his official X account, Miller spoke proudly of the cuts, though he didn’t specifically mention the CPB funds. He said the rescissions bill reductions “root out waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars.”
“These are codifying (Department of Government Efficiency) cuts that don’t advance American interests,” Miller said.
The U.S. Senate has until mid-July to vote on the measure, or the rescissions bill will expire, and the funding will be sent to the entities as previously planned.
A spokesperson for Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno said the congressman already plans to vote for the cuts.
“It is a blatant waste of American taxpayer dollars that Senator Moreno looks forward to putting an end to immediately,” said spokesperson Reagan McCarthy.
Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted did not respond to request for comment.

Stock photo from Getty Images.It’s hardly news that local coverage in Ohio’s cities and towns isn’t what it once was. A new analysis shows that it’s been devastated in most small towns, suburbs and cities in the United States. 
The results have implications for the future of democracy and could be useful to those who want to fix the problem.
The analysis was released on Thursday after a collaboration between the media software company Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News, a nonprofit coalition that seeks to revitalize local journalism. It chugged data and determined that when counted on a per-capita basis, the United States has lost a stunning 75% of its local journalists since 2002.
“To put that statistic in perspective, that means that if you live in a county of 10,000 people, there wouldn’t be even one full-time reporter to cover all of the schools, the town councils, the economic development projects, basketball games, environmental decisions, local businesses, and local events,” the report said. “There are 97,000 cities, towns, counties and other units of government. This report shows that there are the equivalent 27,000 local journalists. Most governments, most neighborhoods, and most residents are being covered poorly or not at all.”
One result of such a loss of coverage is the potential for public corruption. Very often it’s the local press that blows the whistle when a county commissioner uses the highway department to pave his driveway, or a sheriff uses official resources against political opponents.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Another consequence is that without the press looking on, local government is able to act in virtual secret, making huge decisions without input from the community whose money it’s spending.
To determine relative losses in the press corps, the team came up with the concept of “local journalist equivalents.” 
Muck Rack aggregated county-level reporting across all 3,141 U.S. counties. It identified online bylines for news and sports reporters, photographers, part-timers and freelancers. Reporters with print, online and broadcast outlets were all included.
It identified journalists who are “are responsible for the consistent production and/or distribution of newsworthy content” and it assessed who of them mostly produced local content. Muck Rack also came up with a way to allocate journalists who were based in big cities, but covered local topics in surrounding suburban counties.
The analysis then compared those numbers to a set from 2002 developed by David H. Weaver and a team at Indiana University and came up with a 75% decline in journalists covering local news. 
The numbers fell from 40 such reporters per 100,000 residents in 2002 to 8.2 today.
At 7.9 local journalists per 100,000 residents, Ohio ranks 31st among states.
“The basic finding is that it’s even more widespread and severe than we thought,” said Steven Waldman, founder and president of Rebuild Local News.
And the losses haven’t only hammered rural communities.
“When you look at the drop in reporters per population, you see in really vivid terms the effect of the gutting of newsrooms in the suburbs and cities,” Waldman said. 
That said, many of the Appalachian counties in Southeast Ohio showed some of the most dismal numbers. But one had the best.
With just 0.1 local reporter per 100,000 people, Gallia County ranks 86th out of Ohio’s 88 counties and 2,962nd out of 3,124 in the U.S.
But Athens County is just 42 miles away and it ranks the best in Ohio, with 76 local reporters per 100,000 people. That makes it the 23rd best-covered county in the U.S.
The report pointed to a likely explanation.
“There are some oddities,” it said, unsurprisingly, of Athens County. “For example, the Ohio county with the most local journalists per resident is Athens County, but it is helped by the presence of Ohio University. That’s the case for a few other counties with big universities, such as Albemarle County, home of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Those two universities have great student journalists who show up in strong numbers in the Muck Rack data and therefore in this report.”
The report also acknowledged possible shortcomings in the analysis.
“The data doesn’t show the same phenomenon in every county that’s home to a robust student news outlet, probably for reasons related to the content management system, byline policy or other factors,” it said.

(Getty Images)Maine lawmakers postponed action on reforming the state’s troubled child welfare system, this time on a proposal modeled after New Hampshire’s independent child advocate — a program some see as a blueprint to provide oversight and address systemic issues.
There have been many proposals to reform the system in recent years, but some feel that looking to New Hampshire for its Office of the Child Advocate could offer the most promising solution.
Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) introduced LD 1893 in early May. The bill would transfer Maine’s existing child welfare ombudsman into a new, independent agency with expanding responsibilities to advocate for Maine children.
Although the Legislature adjourned in late June, the Health and Human Services Committee decided to hold onto the bill until next session, which is slated to begin in January.
The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the state’s child welfare agency the Office of Child and Family Services, said at the public hearing that it would also like more time to consider the proposal because of the “extensive reach” it could have throughout state government.
The proposed Office of Child Advocate would have the authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate, make public reports, and advise the executive and legislative branches on how best to provide services to the state’s youth beyond just child welfare. This could extend to the Departments of Education, Corrections, or any other agency providing services to or arranging services on behalf of a child.
Moira O’Neill, who helped craft the model in New Hampshire and served as its first child advocate before stepping down in 2021, told Maine Morning Star that the language in LD 1893 is far better compared to the first iteration of New Hampshire’s law. She also pointed out that the legislation proposes the essential components of ombudsman work: independence, impartiality, access to information, and confidentiality.
As O’Neill sees it, children and their interests don’t have a seat at the table under Maine’s current child welfare infrastructure. She pointed out that there are children in Maine who are hungry, abused, neglected, and will be saddled with long-term effects to their health, employment and relationships.
“They need someone who is just for them — not a part time cabinet, not a caring governor, not a legislative committee — but one person whose only job is to hear children, know their best interest, and speak on their behalf,” she said. “It must be an independent someone who is beholden only to the children and the statute.
Though the department spoke neither for nor against LD 1893, it said it is interested in exploring the model as a way to strengthen oversight. It also acknowledged that there are already multiple avenues for oversight including federal regulations, legislative oversight and citizen advisory panels.
Oversight and root causes
After renewed scrutiny in recent years, there have been multiple attempts to restructure the state’s child welfare system. This has included multiple failed legislative attempts, including just last year, to separate the OCFS from DHHS.
Last year, OCFS frontline workers came forward with accounts of onerous workloads that culminated in December with a letter of no confidence in the agency’s leadership.
The bill language presents a shift from policing to promoting better practices, including for state agencies, O’Neill explained.
“You can’t prosecute and fire your way through a system weakness,” she said. “When systems are weak due to lack of funding, work force, training, effective policy, etc., the best solution generally comes from collaborative efforts that enhance support for systems and repairs weaknesses.”
Melissa Hackett, coordinator of the Maine Child Welfare Action Network, said she prefers the proposed Office of Child Advocate model because it does not solely focus on the child welfare system.
“This office taking that bigger picture view felt more promising to me than some of the other proposals that have really, in my opinion … felt reactionary,” Hackett said.
She appreciates that the Office of Child Advocate would build upon the oversight provided by the existing child welfare ombudsman office, while having the ability to explore the root causes that could lead a family to being involved with the system.
That could create what Hackett described as a “both-and” approach to provide oversight and address the systemic factors like substance use disorder or mental health that can bring a family in contact with the child welfare system. But she said that will require public and political will to understand what is really happening with children and families.
Hackett said the proposed child advocate would be able “to really look up from a high level down at what’s happening on the ground to see these trends and to not be singularly focused on one incident or case but to be able to look across those trends to say, ‘This is what we need to really address and this is how we address it to stem the flow of these kids coming into these systems.’”
Confidentiality in child welfare
The Office of Child Advocate could also provide a solution for the ways confidentiality complicates child welfare oversight.
In August 2022, the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee asked DHHS to view records relating to the 2021 deaths of four children. The department denied the committee access, citing confidentiality laws.
After that denial, the committee filed an action in the Kennebec County Superior Court urging the department to comply with its subpoena. The court denied the committee’s request, ruling that it did not have the authority to access the confidential records.
The committee appealed the decision to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, which held a hearing in December 2023 before ruling in line with the lower court decision.
Because of that decision from the state’s highest court, Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) put in a bill last session seeking to allow the committee to access “privileged and confidential” records while keeping them exempt from public disclosure. That proposal was also carried over by the Judiciary Committee to be worked on further next session.
O’Neill said the independent child advocate role outlined in LD 1893 is a better solution than opening up legislator access to that sort of confidential information. That person wouldn’t be influenced by partisan priorities and can serve as a “resource for children and families navigating seemingly unfriendly systems,” she added.

(Haines Eason)When I first moved to Lawrence more than six years ago, my wife and I settled into a neighborhood near Haskell Indian Nations University. I still remember arriving in town and being surprised and excited to see there was “another” university in town. I’d taken a job in communications at the University of Kansas and used to be a teacher, so my interest was piqued. 
At the time, I had no idea there was a federally supported university system created specifically for Native American students. 
Of course. I had the luxury of ignorance. 
But the more I learned about Haskell and the Native peoples whose histories are embedded in this region (and our nation), the more connected I felt to my new hometown. To me, the presence of Haskell in Lawrence boded well — I must have arrived in some progressive paradise, a place where inclusivity was a lived value.
I grew up just outside of Charlottesville, Virginia, and my mother was a fourth grade teacher for decades in two counties adjacent to ours. Given what I know of my mom’s curriculum and my own educational experiences in Virginia, I have to assume that across most of the nation, Native history as taught is largely place names and sanitized Thanksgiving myths. 
Looking back, I don’t remember batting an eye at the fact that, in all the years between kindergarten and 12th grade, I learned little about “colonial America” and next to nothing about Native history. What I did learn was not about colonization. Instead, here and there I encountered tidy, comfortable narratives mostly about settlers travelling across what was implied to be a virginal and largely empty landscape. These were sprinkled as readings in non-history courses — mostly in my English classes.
Recently, a dear friend sent me Tommy Orange’s novel “There There,” and suddenly all the chaos surrounding Haskell the last few years — and some of the current political chaos — tumbled into place for me.
Early in the novel, one of Orange’s characters, Dene Oxendene, unpacks the book’s title — or at least one of its meanings. 
Set in and around Oakland, California, the titular phrase “There There” is an often misquoted reference to former Oakland resident Gertrude Stein. 
At least according to the character, Stein grew up there and returned later in life, only to lament on reacquaintance that the “there” she remembered from her youth was no longer there — lost in a sea of development and urbanization.

Neglect is a decision
Early in my time in Lawrence, I was drawn to Haskell’s grounds. On the one hand, the institution is a time capsule. On the other, it’s a living and breathing college campus that is right in front of us Lawrencians but yet so fully on its own — save for the outreach of a few community members — that it may as well, from the white world in general, be on the moon.
There’s so much contrast on the campus: The decaying football stadium, with its mismatched bleachers, plywood-boarded bathrooms and concession area entrances and towering field lights. That such a large stadium sits empty is more than sad — it seems like a plot.
Then there’s the burial ground.
Tucked behind the campus, it’s well-maintained and expensively fenced, with a picket choice that evokes fencing you sometimes see at military installations. 
Inside the fencing are markers for the 100-plus students who died during Haskell’s boarding school era — a time when Haskell was part of a school network designed to erase Native identity under the guise of civilizing. 
Now, let’s pause. 
How could intentions be noble when considering the institution’s first months? Upon its opening in late 1884, Native students endured extreme weather — drenching rains, freezing cold, then sudden warmth — all while living in unfinished, unheated buildings lacking proper plumbing and while being provided what amounted to a starvation diet. 
Pneumonia and lung ailments spread quickly, and by winter’s end, 10 students had died. Over the next five years, crop failures, fires and continued government underfunding worsened conditions. By 1913, more than 100 children had been buried on campus.
Today, the federal government’s Bureau of Indian Education still has its arms around Haskell’s operations. True self-governance — long promised — remains elusive. And dysfunction has festered.
The school’s student-run paper’s staff have faced intimidation and administrative blowback over reporting on school scandals, which include mishandled sexual assault allegations and theft. Such troubles are not so surprising when one considers the institution has had eight leaders in seven years. 
Add to all this recent mass layoffs and subsequent partial rehiring of staff that have occurred as part of the DOGE budget purge.
And now, there comes word that Haskell faces as much as a 90% budget cut. A new federal budget proposal would reduce funding for Haskell and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in New Mexico, both managed by the BIE, from $182 million to just $22 million next year. 
These are not isolated incidents, and a direct line can be drawn from Haskell’s beginnings to these budget “conversations.”  
We know the current administration’s campaign slogan. It doesn’t deserve any more oxygen. 
But with it in mind, I’ll posit that the greatness of a nation is measured by how it treats its most vulnerable — and how it keeps its promises. So I ask: Can you name a single treaty with Native Americans that the United States has honored or that has served Native Americans well?
 
  The football stadium at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence. (Haines Eason)
Is progressivism really progressive? 
My most personal connection to Native life — a connection I’ll forever treasure — came through a woman I’ll call Abigail. She passed in 2023, and in honor of what I’ve learned about Native traditions, I won’t speak or write her tribal name now.
Abigail was one of the most resilient, wise and clear-eyed people I’ve ever known. And even though I am sure she would be heartbroken by what’s happening at Haskell, I imagine she’d also laugh. Not because it’s funny — but because it doesn’t have anything to do with Natives.
In my heart I believe she would say that what is happening at Haskell, and what has always happened between white and Native people, is really about white people’s problems. Our insecurity, inadequacy and insatiability.
Haskell’s troubles are not Native-created. The troubles challenging many reservations are not Native-created. 
What’s happening at Haskell is an American problem. Don’t be fooled: There is so much abundance in this nation. So much food, land, wealth and more. But the hoarding by those at the top turns the rest of us on each other. Haskell and all native institutions of learning could be well funded with little effort. Health and hunger issues on Native lands — really across all communities — could be solved with straightforward tax adjustments. 
Never forget that the taxation of the rich and redeployment of that capital in the post-WWII years created the most robust economy the world has ever seen.
So, Lawrence. Is it really a progressive paradise? I think the better question is: Are progressives really progressive? Do they have more than platitudes to offer? Or white tears? 
White Americans, myself included, have lived in a simulacrum that is finally fraying at the seams. 
It’s time we feel just a fraction of what our Black and Native neighbors have endured for centuries. 
Maybe then we’ll finally understand that survival isn’t the same as justice.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)In 2019, I attended my first meeting of the Society for Benefit-Cost Analysis in Washington, D.C. The keynote speaker was Cass Sunstein, one of the most prominent public advocates for the use of benefit-cost analysis and former administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President Obama.
His keynote was on a phenomenon he called “sludge.” This was the phenomenon of how much time costs are exacted by the government on individuals through paperwork. 
His idea was that time that people spent on filling out government paperwork is time they could be spending working, resting, with their families, or any of the other ways people spend their time. Therefore, we should consider the time people spend on regulatory compliance as a cost to society.
As policymakers at the federal level passed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” they ushered in a new moment in the history of sludge: the moment sludge was used to try to discourage people from getting health insurance.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Big Beautiful Bill creates new requirements for verifying addresses, cross-checking eligibility and data against other sources, and reduces retroactive coverage from three months to one month. It also imposes work requirements, puts penalties in place for covering immigrants, and makes renewing Medicaid more time-consuming and onerous.
The goal of these changes is to reduce enrollment in Medicaid.
In Ohio, the Center for Community Solutions said in an analysis that enrollment loss could be as high as 450,000 people.
The federal government is not alone in working to create sludge in the Medicaid program. For years, policymakers have been working to exact work requirements on Medicaid recipients.
The problem with this approach is that work requirements don’t work. 
When work requirements for Medicaid enrollment were put in place in Arkansas during the first Trump Administration, most of the people who lost their health insurance were people who were working but did not know how to comply with the new requirements for reporting that had been put in place.
When policymakers at the federal level were working to reform the welfare state, they reduced spending by turning entitlement programs into block grant programs, allocating only a certain amount of money to each state and requiring them to manage that money. 
While many would argue this was not good policy (it certainly turned America’s most important cash assistance program into a shell of itself), it was at least not so cynical of a policy as to throw sand into the cogs of the state then complain about it not working.
Part of the reason for the different strategy is because Medicaid is popular. Of the 50 states, 40 have adopted Medicaid expansion. A majority of the states that have adopted Medicaid expansion voted for Trump in 2024. 
Out-and-out cutting Medicaid would be unpopular among the constituents of legislators. So instead, they turned to rules that seem reasonable on their face — like eligibility verification and work requirements — that in reality just make the system more complicated and push people off health insurance.
Policymaking predicated on deceiving the public is cynical. 
Creating red tape on programs you don’t like removes any moral high ground you have to complain about government inefficiency. 
If you don’t believe in government working, I don’t really know why you want to spend your career working in it.

A new analysis warns that jobs held by both immigrants and US-born workers are at risk.
President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.
If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.
There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Billions of dollars at stake for farmers hit by Trump funding freeze, pause on foreign aid

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
USDA cuts hit small farms as Trump showers billions on big farms

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

Nebraskans know a mighty wind. We know whirling monsters tethered to a blackened firmament while wreaking havoc on fields and towns and lives. 
Tornadoes are a fact of life here from March to the dog days of summer. When one touches us in some way — from death to destruction to simple awe — we ask how we can better keep ourselves safe. 
When we ask such things, we are anything but “losers.”
“Losers” is what Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called those who might question the response to the deadly floods that inundated central Texas on Independence Day. Specifically he said it to a reporter who had asked if there was to be an inquiry into what some officials have acknowledged could have been missteps during the unprecedented rise in the Guadalupe River. Over 120 deaths and more than 160 missing have been reported as of this writing.

“That’s the word choice of losers,” Abbott said, part of a wholly inappropriate metaphor about football champions. Parents of little girls at church camp or families and friends of anyone swept away are anything but losers for wondering what went wrong and if any human decision or lack thereof contributed. 
Even without factoring in the DOGE cutbacks at NOAA and FEMA’s three-day delay to respond, the question is reasonable for loved ones … and reporters. Abbott chose name-calling over leadership.
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, coming off a victory lap for cutting health care benefits to millions and taking food from hungry kids, was even less helpful. When asked on a television news program about the flood, Johnson said, “All we can do is pray.”
Seriously? I assume politics in Johnson’s home state of Louisiana works a similar way it does here in Nebraska, where elected representatives are expected to lead. That includes inquiries, asking tough questions and making changes to keep us safe where needed. 
Want to pray? Fine. But do your job. For details see that whole faith without works thing.
Big Ugly bill?
Lost under the garish light of the Big Ugly, signed into law on July 4, was the U.S. Department of Education’s announcement the day before to withhold $6.2 billion already promised to the nation’s public schools. Nebraska’s share of that money checks in at about $40 million. 
The DOE, now apparently a federal agency in name only, said it was pausing the disbursements for further review even though Congress passed and the president signed the bill in March. Funds were to be allocated on July 1.
According to the Economic Policy Institute, money in “targeted districts” would be used to support “before and after school programs ($1.4 billion), English language learning ($890 million), migrant education ($375 million), academic enrichment ($1.3 billion) and professional development of staff and teachers ($2.2 billion).”
While that lineup stretches across a variety of areas in need of help, the specter of the administration’s obsession with immigration and preoccupation with DEI initiatives underscores its interest in at least a third of the money.
Obviously, Nebraska school districts, many of whom have already drawn up contingencies, will take a sizable hit. Worse, however, could be any further stopping and starting, making for nightmarish budgeting processes. 
For comparison sake on the detritus left from the administration’s proclivity for teeter-totter economic policies, read no further than the current stop/start story of the nation’s tariff conundrum.
The Fourteenth Amendment
Finally, last Wednesday, July 9, we marked 157 years of living with the Fourteenth Amendment, the first line of which has as much relevance today as it did in 1868. That’s because while the current administration is playing fast and loose with the amendment’s due process requirement, what we call birthright citizenship is also being challenged. 
The amendment has five sections, the first of which contains the two lines referenced above: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
Section 5 says “The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.” Hmm? A joint session for a Fourteenth Amendment reading? Better yet, how about Congress using its power to insist we follow it?
Whatever … 157 years is something to celebrate.

Consider first this simple question: Why do local Democrats relentlessly press local Republican officials to condemn President Trump’s policies, irrelevant to town governance, while Greenwich Democratic Reps. Hector Arzeno and Steve Meskers escape scrutiny for harmful legislation from Hartford that directly affects our quality of life?
I’m referring to Hartford House Bill 5002, misleadingly titled “An Act Concerning Housing and the Needs of Homeless Persons.”  In reality, the bill became a brazen state power grab, stripping Connecticut municipalities of their sovereignty through “fair share” housing quotas and mandated transit-oriented development.
Reps. Arzeno and Meskers did vote “no” on HB 5002, a calculated move likely permitted by their party’s supermajority to shield them in swing districts like Greenwich. More than a few Fairfield County Democrats also voted “no,” hinting at a coordinated strategy to protect vulnerable representatives while advancing Hartford’s agenda unchallenged.
Beyond their hollow votes, they also failed to support key amendments that could have mitigated the bill’s impact. These amendments would have allowed accessory apartments to be included as affordable housing units and would have exempted municipalities from submitting housing plans if they met the 10% threshold of affordable housing units under 8-30g “Affordable Housing Land Use Appeals Procedure.” 
The amendments were tailored to protect zoning autonomy.  The other proposed amendments were attempts to extend tight time frames, protect rural areas and watersheds (drainage basins), reduce administrative costs and regulatory reporting burdens.  They also sought to eliminate “as of right” development (translation: towns having no say in their development) and soften penalties for non-compliance. 
Arzeno and Meskers repeatedly pledged to defend local zoning on the campaign trail. Yet, there’s no evidence of their advocacy —no speeches, no votes for protective amendments, no effort to safeguard Greenwich’s independence. Their silence stands in stark contrast to Sen. Ryan Fazio who backed Senate Schedule A which made transit-oriented development voluntary, freeing towns from state pressure to rezone near train stations for high-density housing.  State Rep. Tina Courpas also spoke out vigorously against the state overreach regarding the sovereignty of Greenwich’s zoning.
If Meskers expressed concerns about HB 5002’s scope, why didn’t he or Arzeno support the amendments to curb the bill’s ambitions? Their inaction betrayed their loyalty to Hartford’s party bosses over Greenwich’s residents.  
Meskers praised the previous legislative session’s “Work, Live, Ride” bill, which he and Arzeno backed after securing minor “local-friendly” amendments only for it to fail in the Senate thanks to Sen. Fazio’s filibuster. Their selective engagement raises a critical question: Why didn’t they fight for Greenwich’s zoning rights on HB 5002?  Why did Meskers and Arzeno vote for the strike-all bill amendments (A and B), which paved the way from a bill with a narrow focus on homelessness to an omnibus housing reform?
Greenwich deserves political leaders who don’t hide behind token “no” votes but fiercely defend our zoning autonomy at every turn.  The only Greenwich Democrat to take a stand was Gov. Ned Lamont, a Greenwich resident, who vetoed this undemocratic overreach. 
Arzeno and Meskers had clear opportunities to back corrective amendments as  Courpas and Fazio did, but they chose silence. They endlessly boast about having ‘a seat at the table’ as majority Democrats, but they never use their influence to challenge their party’s harmful policies like HB 5002.  Their inaction was tantamount to consent to Hartford’s mandates, prioritizing party loyalty over Greenwich’s interests. 
Our town’s future depends on representatives who prioritize Greenwich’s right to local control over its affairs rather than party ideology and the special interests of developers of every stripe. Lincoln’s timeless warning to public servants about fooling all the people all the time is standing the test of time in Greenwich. 
These political antics no longer fool some of the people for even a moment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-14 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Bridging CT’s rail funding gap,Lou Rinaldi,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/14/bridging-connecticuts-rail-funding-gap-policy-options-targeting-high-income-earners-lou/,Here are several progressive ways to close the CT rail services system's $11 million budget shortfall.,"A looming 10% fare hike for CT Rail and Metro-North commuters has highlighted an $11 million budget shortfall for the state’s rail services in the upcoming fiscal year. 
The Connecticut Department of Transportation, which requested $327 million but received $316 million from the legislature, is moving forward with the fare increase to cover rising operational costs. This has sparked a debate on alternative funding mechanisms, with a particular focus on whether the state’s wealthiest residents should contribute more to support public transportation.
The following report outlines several policy options for bridging this funding gap through progressive taxation, ensuring the long-term solvency and affordability of Connecticut’s vital rail network.
The current landscape: A progressive system with room for adjustment
Connecticut already has a progressive tax system. The state income tax features seven brackets, with the top marginal rate of 6.99% applying to income over $500,000 for single filers and $1,000,000 for those married filing jointly. Additionally, Connecticut taxes capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income and levies a 12% estate tax on estates exceeding the federal exemption ($13.61 million in 2024). The state also has a progressive real estate conveyance tax on high-value properties.
The following proposals build upon this existing framework to generate dedicated revenue for transportation.
Policy option 1: A “millionaire’s surtax” for transportation
The proposal: Following the model recently implemented in neighboring Massachusetts, Connecticut could introduce a “millionaire’s surtax.” This would be an additional tax on annual income exceeding a certain threshold, with the revenue explicitly dedicated to a transportation trust fund.
Structure: A 1% to 2% surtax could be levied on all income over $1 million, regardless of filing status. For instance, a 1.5% surtax would mean a household with $1.5 million in taxable income would pay an additional $7,500 (1.5% of $500,000).
Revenue potential: Given the concentration of high-income earners in Connecticut, even a modest surtax could generate substantial revenue, likely exceeding the current $11 million gap and providing a stable source for future investment.
Pros: This is a highly targeted approach that would only affect a small percentage of top earners. It has a successful precedent in Massachusetts, where a 4% surtax is funding transportation and education initiatives.
Cons: Opponents may argue that such a tax could incentivize high-income residents to relocate to states with lower tax burdens, a phenomenon known as “tax flight.”
Policy option 2: A surcharge on capital gains and investment income
The proposal: This option would create a dedicated surcharge on investment-related income for high earners, acknowledging that a significant portion of their wealth is derived from investments rather than wages.
Structure: A surcharge of 1% to 2% could be applied to capital gains, dividends, and interest income for individuals with a Connecticut Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) over a certain level, for example, $500,000 for single filers and $1 million for joint filers. This would be in addition to the current 6.99% top marginal rate.
Revenue potential: This would capture a growing source of income for the state’s wealthiest residents and could be a significant and consistent revenue stream for transportation projects.
Pros: This targets wealth generation directly and could be seen as more equitable than a broad-based income surtax. It would also apply to a demographic with a greater capacity to contribute.
Cons: The revenue from capital gains can be volatile and dependent on stock market performance. Critics might also contend that it discourages investment within the state.
Policy option 3: Enhancing the real estate conveyance tax on luxury properties
The proposal: This policy would increase the marginal rates of the state’s existing real estate conveyance tax, often referred to as a “mansion tax,” for the highest-value properties.
Structure: The current progressive structure could be made more so by adding new, higher tax brackets for properties sold for over, for instance, $3 million and $5 million. The additional revenue generated from these top-tier sales would be earmarked for the transportation fund.
Revenue potential: While the revenue stream would be less predictable than an income-based tax, it could provide significant injections of funding from high-value real estate transactions.
Pros: This tax is paid at the point of a major financial transaction, potentially making it more palatable than an annual income tax increase. It also directly links a source of significant wealth to a public good.
Cons: The real estate market can be cyclical, leading to fluctuations in revenue. Some may also argue that it could have a cooling effect on the luxury housing market.
Policy option 4: A dedicated transportation levy via the estate tax
The proposal: This option would involve either a marginal increase in the state’s 12% estate tax rate or the creation of a dedicated transportation “carve-out” from existing estate tax revenue.
Structure: The state could increase the estate tax rate by a small margin (e.g., to 12.5% or 13%) with the additional percentage dedicated to transportation. Alternatively, a set percentage of the total estate tax collected annually could be allocated directly to the transportation fund.
Revenue potential: Given that the tax applies to estates over $13.61 million, even a small rate increase could yield millions for transportation.
Pros: This tax is levied on the intergenerational transfer of significant wealth and would not impact the vast majority of Connecticut residents.
Cons: Estate tax revenue can be highly variable from year to year, depending on the number and value of estates being settled.
Conclusion: A question of priorities
The impending fare hikes on CT Rail and Metro-North underscore a critical choice for Connecticut: continue to place the burden of rising costs on riders or seek new, more progressive revenue streams. 
The policy options presented here offer a pathway to not only close the immediate $11 million funding gap but also to create a more resilient and equitable funding model for the state’s public transportation system for years to come. 
Each option comes with its own set of economic and political considerations, but all point toward a future where those with the greatest ability to contribute play a larger role in supporting a vital public service.

ICE agents face a nearly 700% increase in assaults against them, and doxxing websites are attempting to reveal officers’ identities and those of their families and children, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
“Let me leave a little message for the protesters — the haters, the criminals, the ones who want to threaten ICE officers,” said U.S. Border Czar Tom Homan at the conclusion of his speech at the Turning Point USA’s Student Action Summit in Tampa on Saturday night.
“I get death threats all the time. You know what, I’m sick of the assholes. You want some? Come get some,” Homan said.
After Donald Trump won back the White House last November, Homan declared that ICE would prioritize deporting noncitizens with criminal histories.
That hasn’t been the case, however. The latest ICE statistics show that as of June 29, the agency had detained 57,861 people, of whom 41,495 — 71.7% — had no criminal convictions, according to the Associated Press.
‘We’re looking for you’
Total ICE arrests have been accelerating in the past six weeks after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller gave the agency a quota of 3,000 arrests per day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump’s second term in office.
Homan now says that anyone who is undocumented in the United States is vulnerable to being swept up, detained, and deported.
“If you’re in the country illegally, you’re on the table,” he said on Saturday. “It’s not okay to enter this country illegally. It’s a crime. It’s not okay to ignore a judge’s order of deportation. We’re looking for you. We’ve got over 600,000 illegal aliens with criminal records walking the streets of this nation. We got 1.4 million illegal aliens who’ve had due process at great taxpayer expense who were ordered to remove, and never left. They become a fugitive. And we’re looking for you, too.”
Cracking down on undocumented immigration was a top issue in Trump’s winning campaign last year against Kamala Harris and, since he’s returned to the White House, the number of migrants caught crossing the southern border has become historically low.
In June, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) registered the lowest number of nationwide encounters in CBP history, at 25,243. That was 89% lower than the monthly average for years 2021 through 2024, according to DHS statistics.
Homan boasted about those numbers on Saturday, and said that the infusion of new funding from the just signed domestic and tax spending package will only boost DHS’s efforts. “You think we’re doing good now? Just wait to see what happens,” he promised.
The increased raids by ICE have been met by protests that sometimes have sparked confrontations with agents. “The hate is incredible” against ICE agents, Homan said.
“You want to protest ICE, shame on you but have at it. It’s your First Amendment right. You want to disagree with the Trump policies, okay, you have the right to disagree. But I said on Day One: You cross that line and put a hand on an ICE officer, you’re going to jail.”
The 63-year-old border czar set the tone for his 20-minute speech from the start in front of the youthful group of conservatives when he declared himself a “badass” who sometimes uses profanity.
“If I offend anybody here tonight, I don’t give a sh*t,” he said as the crowd exploded in applause. 
Tampa protester
About five minutes into his address, an audience member began heckling Homan, asking whether he was an MS-13 member. Homan tore into him.
“This guy ain’t got the balls to an ICE officer,” he proclaimed. “This guy lives in his mother’ basement. The only thing that doesn’t surprise me is that you don’t have purple hair and a nose ring. Get out of here, you loser!”
He went on to say, “If you’re such a badass, meet me offstage in 13 minutes and 50 seconds. I guarantee you, he sits down to pee.”
He continued: “Assholes like this guy — they vilify the men and women of ICE. They think they’re going to intimidate or scare us? I’m not going anywhere. Neither are the men and women of ICE.”
On Friday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties. Immigration advocacy groups had accused the administration in a lawsuit of  systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its immigration crackdown.
Bill Essayli, the U.S. attorney for  the Central District of California, disputed the judge’s ruling.
“We strongly disagree with the allegations in the lawsuit and maintain that our agents have never detained individuals without proper legal justification. Our federal agents will continue to enforce the law and abide by the U.S. Constitution.”
Turning Point USA’s Student Action Summit has become an annual summer conference for conservative activists. During this weekend’s event, several members of the Trump administration were in attendance, such as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Homeland Security head Kristi Noem, and director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.

The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”

The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
Sex-based protections
The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.

Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
‘Scientific and policy debates’
Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.

Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz regaled about a thousand people at a South Dakota Democratic Party fundraiser Saturday night with jabs at the state’s former and current governors, advice for winning back rural voters and blue collar workers, and pride in liberal ideals.
The 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee — who was on the losing ticket with presidential nominee Kamala Harris — delivered the keynote speech to a sellout crowd at the 2025 McGovern Day dinner at the Sioux Falls Convention Center. Reporters were allowed into the event, but not to take photographs once it started.
It didn’t take long for Walz to criticize the actions of U.S. Homeland Security secretary and Republican former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. 
“If you had to pick somebody who’s the antithesis of the South Dakota I know, it would be that,” he said.

The two served in Congress, cosponsoring bills together before 2018, when each was elected to lead their respective states.
Their relationship soured during the COVID-19 pandemic when they took divergent approaches, and further deteriorated when Noem described Walz as a “radical” in her role as a Trump surrogate during last year’s presidential campaign.
Walz, speaking of his preparation to appear in South Dakota, said “I had to decide what I was going to wear.”
“When you’re a governor and you’re in South Dakota, do you dress as a fireman? You dress as a cowgirl?” he said.
The joke was a dig at Noem. She donned firefighting gear at a U.S. Coast Guard training facility, for example, and wore a cowboy hat for an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“I know it’s petty, but some people just bring out the petty,” Walz said.
Advice for SD Democrats
He laid out his connections to South Dakota once the laughter died down. He grew up nearby in Nebraska. He hunted pheasants in Winner, saw drive-in movies in Lake Andes and “spent too much time” at a bar called the Longbranch in Burke.
Walz also prodded current South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, who recently signed a bill that will allow the concealed carry of pistols on college campuses by gun owners with enhanced permits. Walz described that as one of the Republican talking points about South Dakota being “the freest state in the nation.”

“I think some of you may have a difference of opinion in that. I ran into an OB-GYN that says that’s not true,” Walz said, referencing South Dakota’s near-total abortion ban.
Walz told Democrats that Republicans who paint them as “elites” are cutting taxes for the wealthy and reducing support for student aid programs and Medicaid while “tearing apart” rural communities and mass-detaining undocumented immigrants.
“Is our immigration system broken? Yes. But our moral system sure as hell should not be with throwing people in camps,” he said, a reference to a detention center for migrants in the Florida Everglades that President Trump calls “Alligator Alcatraz.”
“The people building prison camps are never the good guys in history,” Walz said.
He urged Democrats to work on issues of importance to rural and working class South Dakotans, like Medicaid and Medicare, and to work with labor unions. 
“There’s a direct correlation between the strength of the middle class and economic security with the number of people who are in labor unions,” he said. 
He also suggested the national Democratic Party should pay more attention to places like South Dakota if it expects to build a coalition durable enough to compete outside of its traditional strongholds and battleground states. “A few million dollars” could make a difference and help South Dakota build the Democratic bench, he said.
“I hear people say ‘there are no Democrats in South Dakota,’” Walz said. “But there’s a hell of a lot in this room.” 
Party expects more candidates in 2026
The McGovern Day dinner is the state party’s largest annual fundraiser. Regular tickets cost $125. Meet-and-greet tickets cost twice that.
“We haven’t had a McGovern Day dinner this big at least since I’ve been around,” said Shane Merrill, chair of the state party.  
The party leaned into Walz’s fame for more than ticket sales. Vermillion brewery XIX whipped up a batch of “Walz on Tap” blonde ale, sold by the can at cocktail stations and by the four-pack in a silent auction.

The enthusiasm was tempered by reality. South Dakotans registered as independents or without any political affiliation outnumber Democrats. Republicans have the most registrants and hold every statewide office, all three of the state’s congressional seats, and all but nine of the seats in the 105-member Legislature.
Democrats have faced criticism during recent South Dakota election cycles for not fielding candidates, sometimes for offices as high as Congress. Before the speeches started Saturday, state party Executive Director Dan Ahlers said that won’t be a problem in 2026.
“I need two of me to interview all the people who want to run,” he said. 
The party already has candidates for U.S. Senate (Julian Beaudion), secretary of state (Terrence Davis) and U.S. representative, although Ahlers said that candidate won’t announce until the fall. Nineteen-year-old Robert Arnold has announced his candidacy for governor, and Ahlers said he expects another hopeful to announce for that race, as well.
Later, speaking from the stage, Ahlers declared “we can no longer be content with a few seats at the table. We need to run the table.”
“It shouldn’t be enough to field a good Democratic candidate,” he said. “We need to elect Democratic candidates.” 
State Sen. Liz Larson, D-Sioux Falls, said she’s proud to have been the first female state Senate minority leader, but told the audience that it took time to get there. She lost in her first run for office in 2020, but “knocked on thousands of doors” and won on her second and third go-rounds.
Democrats believe, she said, “that you’re no better than anybody else, and we’re all in this together.”
“That is a politics worth showing up for,” Larson said.

The question now is how broadly the class action process could be used to address other issues where the government has taken illegal action against large groups of Americans across state lines. 
The post With birthright case, class actions emerging as important tool against reckless Trump actions appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","At the close of its spring term, the Supreme Court dealt a serious blow to the power of all Americans to protect themselves from illegal government actions. In Trump v. CASA, Inc., the court held that individuals, organizations, and even state governments cannot obtain “universal” injunctions from a federal court that are binding across the country.  
Preservation of the rule of law for all Americans now requires that we turn to other strategies to hold the Trump administration accountable. Expanded use of class actions against the federal government appears to be among the best remaining options to secure our rights and prevent government overreach. 
The practice of obtaining universal injunctions, often referred to as “nationwide” injunctions, had become a favored tactic of aggrieved individuals and organizations seeking to protect against overreaching government action. The tactic had been used against the government by partisans of all stripes, often on ideological grounds. It was employed, with frustrating success, during recent Democratic administrations by Republicans (who filed many cases in Texas or Florida). More recently, the tables have been turned by Democrats (filing in jurisdictions like California, Washington, or Massachusetts).  
The case in which the Supreme Court finally chose to limit federal court authority to issue universal injunctions is about the crucially important right to birthright citizenship – a straightforward case of constitutional interpretation that, even if the constitutional language was not clear, has been settled by Supreme Court precedent for more than 100 years.  
In the context of birthright citizenship, only a nationwide injunction makes sense because, most obviously, someone cannot rationally be declared a United States citizen in Massachusetts without being afforded the same rights of citizenship when across the border in New Hampshire.   
So where does the Supreme Court’s ruling leave birthright citizens? Does each person who was born in the United States need to file a separate case to have the government’s executive order on birthright citizenship deemed illegal and/or inapplicable to them? Probably not. 
As the Supreme Court majority opinion suggests, the question of the constitutionality of birthright citizenship can be decided for all birthright citizens in the context of a class action. Indeed, last week the plaintiffs in another case seeking protections for birthright citizens, Barbara, et al. v. Donald Trump, et al, filed in New Hampshire, obtained class certification and a nationwide injunction for class members. 
This is not a surprise. The question of the legality of Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order presents a classic case for class action treatment. It provides a single overriding common question based on a straightforward legal issue (and a longstanding Supreme Court precedent). That common question leads directly to the uniform conclusion that the executive order is unconstitutional with respect to every affected individual across the nation.   
After the class in New Hampshire was quickly certified, the rule governing class actions permitted those appointed to represent the class to apply immediately for an injunction on behalf of the entire group of affected individuals. That injunction looks virtually the same as the ones the Supreme Court just struck down. 
The question then is how broadly the class action process could be used to address other issues in which the government has taken illegal action against large groups of Americans across state lines.  
Could it be used, for example, to address wholesale visa revocations that have occurred without compliance with immigration regulations? Lawyers in New Hampshire are trying. They are seeking class action status to represent many international students whose visas to study in the US are at risk because of the Trump administration’s blanket revocations. 
Would class action status be granted to federal employees across the country who were illegally terminated from their jobs by DOGE?  It might, if they have a common claim that their termination was illegal under a specific law or regulation, including civil service regulations. Similarly, class action status and injunctive relief might be granted to community-based non-profits that have had their funding terminated in the middle of a lawfully awarded grant. 
One irony of the Supreme Court’s promotion of class actions as an alternative to universal injunctions is that the court has spent the last two decades limiting class actions in a variety of ways. It is much harder now than at any time since class action practice became embedded in American jurisprudence to get class treatment for a group with an interest in a common outcome.  
However, there is a specific provision in the class action rule (Rule 23(b)(2)) that still provides a pathway to injunctive relief. Courts that might have issued a nationwide injunction before the Supreme Court’s recent ruling might well be open instead to considering use of class procedures to achieve effectively the same result.  
There is no doubt that fighting illegal government action became harder after the CASA decision. But the Supreme Court has spoken, and the opportunity to pursue class actions is the lifeline they chose to throw us.

The small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.
So when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.
But that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.
“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.
  Rayna Paul, environmental director for the Native Village of Kipnuk, said the $20 million grant awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to the village was crucial for protecting buildings, homes and infrastructure threatened by riverbank erosion. But now the grant has been canceled, and the village may eventually have to relocate. (Photo courtesy of Rayna Paul)
Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.
Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.
The EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.
Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.
The single largest grant canceled: A $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36 million.

More cuts could be coming. The Washington Post reported in late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.


Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations

Two weeks ago, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.
“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”

The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:
“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has canceled more than 600 grants — totaling more than $2.7 billion — since President Donald Trump took office.

Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.
But on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a Biden-era executive order that prioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.
Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.
  The streets of Pound, Virginia, were underwater after severe flooding in July 2022. Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit organization, planned to use a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to demolish flood ravaged buildings in the community and to design a wall to protect its downtown. But President Donald Trump’s administration abruptly canceled the funding. Appalachian Voices is among a group of nonprofits, tribes and local governments suing the EPA to restore the funding.

Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent,” more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.
“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.
On Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

From hope to heartbreak in Texas

The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.
Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.
But on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.

But that grant was canceled. (Photo courtesy of Downwinders at Risk)
“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.
He and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.
The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.
“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”

With the American Rescue Plan Act supplying $273 million the DNR was able to reduce its decades long maintenance and repair backlog, while developing a new state park in Flint, with construction on the park expected to finish in 2026.
Out of 168 projects, the DNR has begun or completed 122, with the department beginning its efforts in early 2024. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“These critical federal relief funds are at the heart of many incredibly transformative projects at 55 state parks across our peninsulas,” Kristen Kosick, the department’s parks and recreation chief said in a statement. “Visitors are already seeing or will see important upgrades and enhancements to park amenities and infrastructure, changes that are geared toward a safer, more welcoming environment, greater comfort and more positive guest experiences. We appreciate the public’s understanding and patience while some locations are closed for construction, and we look forward to visitors enjoying these vital upgrades when the projects are complete.”
Among those projects are renovations at the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory on Belle Isle, which reopened in December, alongside complete trail paving at Fred Meijer White Pine Trail State Park, major renovations at the newly reopened visitor center at Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park and upgraded water and electrical systems at Tahquamenon Falls State Park’s modern campground.

A white mob burned New York City’s Colored Orphan Asylum. The drawing above depicting that attack was featured in Harper’s Weekly on Aug. 1, 1863.
The Civil War Draft Riots began in Manhattan — one of the bloodiest insurrections in the nation’s history. What started as a riot by white working-class residents, upset by the government’s draft, turned into an attack on Black Americans. The mob of thousands torched dozens of buildings, including the Colored Orphan Asylum, which housed up to 800 children. 
“On the 13th July at 4 PM, an infuriated mob … surrounded the premises of the Asylum and 500 of them entered the house … they deliberately set fire to it … simply because it was the home of unoffending colored orphan children,” according to the orphanage’s board minutes. 
The mob shot, hanged and burned Black residents. A crowd watched as the mob tortured and killed sailor William Williams. No one intervened, and when the mob finished, they cheered, promising to carry out vengeance on “every n—– in New York.” 
By the end of the carnage, at least 120 had been killed, and more than 2,000 were injured. Within two years, the Black population had plummeted beneath 10,000, the lowest for the city in more than three decades. Many of those who stayed eventually made their way to a neighborhood now known as Harlem.

Now is the time.
It has been an oft-used phrase, so much so that the gravity of what is happening feels softened. However, we are at a critical juncture in history — we have the gift of hindsight, the knowledge of what’s to come and the rights to actually do something about it.
What do I mean by this?
Hindsight shows us the patterns of fascist regimes and those that run them. One need only read a book like Ruth Ben-Ghiat’s “Strongmen” (written back in the dark ages of 2020) or watch a documentary about World War II to understand the playbook. Forget that Project 2025 was posted publicly for years on the internet before the 2024 election cycle revved up: there’s precedent for all of what we are experiencing now.
Which leads to what’s to come. Perhaps we don’t have a word-for-word script for what we are going to face as a country under a blatantly authoritarian regime, but a thematic overture is being played over the airwaves, online, and in conversation around us. The grip is tightening and we are being steered towards the edge of a cliff where our rights will fall away from us as we plummet to the bottom.
Despite the ominous music, though, our right to free speech has not been taken away yet. Trump has said he wants to deport or imprison people who disagree with him, but he doesn’t have the infrastructure at the moment to make this possible. So, we have to hustle to stand up for what we do believe in so such a foundation cannot be finalized. This means time is of the essence — now.

Vermont is in a particularly appropriate place for such action with the Burlington International Airport. If the citizen researchers have indeed gotten the numbers correct, Vermonters are on the hook for several hundred people being transported by ICE to other locations.
This is not something to let pass under the radar.
It is the blatant use of authoritarian power in a state that prides itself on progressive politics, one that sent forth a democratic socialist to the presidential primaries. Within these borders, innocent humans are being shipped off like cargo, treated like criminals when their only crime is existing.
What we do now (or what we don’t) will matter not only for Vermont’s reputation, but for any state with an airport, train station, etc. where such acts are happening. Inaction will send the message to those in power that we think this is okay. It will continue to deepen our complicity in the atrocities that have already been allowed to occur, and literally clear the runway for more grievous acts of violence and oppression.
It is incredibly important that Vermonters reach out to the Burlington International Airport and express their concern about the use of a community resource to aid and abet a fascist project. We need to demand accountability. 
We have the ability to change the course of history, but the window is closing gradually every day. The more we let it close, the more effort it will take to open it again.

I’ve worked in early childhood policy, sat on education boards, and am a parent of two kids. So, I no longer see school funding as just a line item—I see it as a living ecosystem. One that touches every part of how we grow up, how we govern, and how we feed both bodies and minds.
And when you take $169 million out of that ecosystem? You starve it.
Let’s be clear about the headline: $169 million in federal education funding, already appropriated for North Carolina public schools, is being withheld by the Trump administration.
That’s not just a number. That’s breakfasts unserved, teaching assistants laid off, classroom repairs delayed, and after-school programs canceled. In rural and urban schools alike, it means the things children need most—predictability, nutrition, safety—get pushed to the side while adults debate in far-off chambers.
 Let’s talk about food
Schools aren’t just places where children learn to read. They’re where many children eat their only consistent meal of the day. When funding disappears, so do food programs—especially the locally grown, nutritionally rich ones that require coordination between cafeterias, farmers, and county budgets.
This is North Carolina—a state with deep agricultural roots. Our school meals should be built from what we grow: sweet potatoes, collards, strawberries, milk, and cornmeal. But farm-to-school programs rely on investment. So, when funds vanish, kids get boxed meals with shelf-stable processed food, while nearby farmers struggle to stay in business.
It’s a cruel irony. The same week students go hungry, local produce goes unsold. That’s what happens when we treat food as a commodity instead of a public good. When we sever schools from farms, and children from land, we lose more than money—we lose the muscle memory of community.
 What are public schools for?
Public schools are more than academic institutions—they are community anchors, disaster shelters, polling places, nutrition hubs, and neighborhood stabilizers. When we underfund them, we’re not just weakening the education system—we’re weakening the civic infrastructure that holds us all together.
That’s why this $169 million shortfall hits differently. It isn’t just about teacher salaries or textbooks (though those both matter deeply). It’s about the entire network of care that makes public life possible:
The school nurse who catches the first signs of asthma before a child ends up in the ER. The cafeteria worker who packs extra food on Fridays for kids who won’t eat again until Monday. The bus driver who is the first adult a child sees each morning—and often the steadiest.
Public schools are one of the last remaining public goods that serve everyone—regardless of income, zip code, or political party. When we defund them, we say that children’s futures are negotiable. That community stability is optional. That public life itself can be privatized.
 This isn’t just education policy. It’s a moral test.
When federal funds are withheld, and states like ours already dodge their constitutional obligations (see: Leandro), it’s easy for people to tune out. But that’s exactly the problem. We’ve grown numb to numbers, disconnected from consequences.
So let me bring it home:
That $169 million could support thousands of teaching assistants—most of whom are women of color, holding schools together on poverty wages. It could modernize HVAC systems in aging schools where students are breathing mold. It could expand partnerships between school districts and small farms—keeping our children healthy and our economy rooted.
But none of that happens if we accept political theater over public trust.
 So, what can we do?
We start by remembering what schools represent: the original community commons. A place where futures are planted like seeds—and either watered with investment or left to dry up under budget shortfalls.
We don’t have to accept scarcity as inevitable. We don’t have to pit programs against each other. We can demand better—from Raleigh, from Washington, and ourselves.
Local giving helps. Advocacy helps. Voting helps. But more than anything, reframing our mindset helps. Public schools, public food, and public life are not luxuries. They are infrastructure, just as vital as bridges and roads—and far more human.
So, if you’ve ever cared about a child, shared a meal, or voted in a school gym, this story is yours too.
The question isn’t just “Where did the money go?”
It’s: What kind of future are we growing—and who gets to harvest it?",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_education-funding.jpg,,,2025-07-13 08:05:51.279321

The norm today is that everyone my age has a smartphone and social media. What is not generally known is just how harmful these things are to the underdeveloped mind of the adolescent.
As a 14-year-old myself, I deny the necessity of having a personal internet-connected electronic device. Of course, people may argue that a phone will be needed for communication purposes.  A landline or a talk-and-text phone satisfies that demand.
But besides this, I find that everything that is a part of growing up is better carried out without a smartphone.

Adults tell me all the time how addictive merely scrolling on a screen is for them. So how much self-control are teens my age supposed to have while being exposed to social media platforms that are algorithmically designed to keep them hooked?
It simply isn’t fair. Parents ask too much of their kids to be able to regulate themselves when handed such powerfully addictive forces. 
Usage inevitably results in derailment of human functioning. Access to social media can result in emergency room visits and death. The way I see it, the idea of even possessing a device capable of providing access to such harm is unacceptable. But why, then, are so many kids, of all ages through 18, being forced to put up with it on such a large scale?
So-called safeguards and moderation of use are ineffective. These products are designed to be addictive. Compare this to smoking: you wouldn’t give someone a cigarette because it has minimal benefits like relaxation, has a filter, and then tell them to resist the addictiveness of nicotine by using it in moderation.
My peers never asked for a defective tool to make their lives miserable and unsuccessful. When children ask for a phone, they are really asking to not be left out, which is normal and reasonable. But on what planet is it okay to “be included” at the cost of so much harm? The price is ruining, and even terminating children’s lives. 
When I think of what decision my parents made in raising me that I’m most grateful for, what always comes to mind as largely significant is that they have given me a screen-and-social-media-free childhood. If screens were a big part of my life, they would eventually replace everything else important to me.
We don’t need smartphones and social media, no matter how much Big Tech wants us to believe otherwise. Submitting because of the pressure to “fit in” means that my peers are being compromised to satisfy industrial greed. 
When has “It’s too hard for me to forgo for x,y and z reasons” been the right response to anything that we know is dangerous? Adults, with all due respect, please be responsible. Don’t wait until your own child has been harmed to take action. 
It’s been discouraging to watch so many of my peers buy into the shiny new promise of “digital is better.” My friends dismiss my entreaties for them not to pick the poisoned apple, by saying things like, “If you don’t have a phone, you’re behind the times.”
Behind?    
No. Not behind, but not a part of the unhealthy norm. One after the other, I watch my peers join the crowd, all marching towards the glowing iPhone screen for a horizon. It beckons to them like some sort of masked beacon of doom. They know no better than to march on, fixated and drawn by the intoxicating glow, and can’t slow their steps as they approach the abyss into which thousands have already fallen for one reason. 
Not many stay “behind” with me, and I see the consequences daily. My peers with phones and/or social media are often visibly shallower of thought, and less inclined to be interested in aspects of real life. It gets harder and harder to find other kids who are interested in much else. 
The ideal alternative to a screen based childhood is as described in the Vermont Declaration of Digital Independence. 
Recently in Vermont, a bill that banned smartphones in schools was passed. As this bill goes into effect, I hope parents may feel relieved of the pressure to give their children social media.  One of the biggest reasons parents give social media is because schools formerly required students to use it.
Vermont schools may henceforth exemplify how much healthier phone-and-social media-free environments are to communities not only nationally but globally. Vermont is the first state to make it illegal for schools to use social media to communicate with students. Other states should follow suit ASAP.
A screen-and-social-media-free childhood should not be considered a privilege that is impossible to accomplish because it means challenging the norm. It is crucial to the lives of my generation to take this step.
For the sake of my peers, I hope that together as a community we can take the right steps towards making childhood safe, supportive and screen-independent.

Expanding Medicaid could still save lives.","If they only knew then what they know now.
In hindsight, Mississippians who supported Medicaid expansion would have been better off had they accepted a work requirement in the 2024 legislative session.
Instead, many Democrats in the Mississippi House helped block a bill that would have enacted Medicaid expansion in the state to provide health insurance for primarily the working poor, but only if it included a work requirement. 
At the time, House Democrats rightfully pointed out the administration of former President Joe Biden would not have approved the work requirement, thus preventing the bill from becoming law. Additionally, Democrats argued that some states had tried to implement work requirements in their expansion plans but were shot down by federal courts under the first administration of President Donald Trump.
But now, thanks to since-reelected Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” as it is called, all Medicaid adults under the age of 65, except for certain groups such as parents of young children, students and the disabled, must work to receive Medicaid coverage.
If the bill had passed in the 2024 session of the Mississippi Legislature, the state would have Medicaid expansion now providing health care to many poor, working Mississippians  — at least those earning up to $21,579 per year for an individual and up to $44,363 annually for a family of four.
And regrettably for Mississippi, the “Big Beautiful Bill” is repealing a component passed during the Biden administration that would have provided a significant additional financial incentive for Mississippi and the other nine holdout states to finally expand Medicaid. That financial incentive equated to about $700 million for Mississippi.
If Mississippi had expanded Medicaid in 2024 with the work requirement, the state would have gotten a large portion of those financial incentive funds. Now, if Mississippi expands Medicaid, it will not get that financial incentive.
But importantly, the federal government still pays 90% of the health care costs for people on Medicaid because of expansion. That is a substantial financial incentive on its own that is not going away.
In reality, the reason Medicaid expansion did not pass in 2024 is much more nuanced than just blaming legislative Democrats. After all, Republicans hold a two-thirds supermajority in each chamber of the Mississippi Legislature. They have the votes to pass whatever they want.
But because not all Republican lawmakers were on board with Medicaid expansion in Mississippi, it is far from certain that any proposal — including the early ones House Democrats and others opposed — could have passed the state Senate even with the work requirement. House Speaker Jason White said at the time there were not enough Senate Republicans on board to pass the bill.
And it should be pointed out House Democratic leaders, trying to solve the impasse and get Medicaid expansion over the finish line in 2024, made the offer to vote for a Medicaid expansion proposal with a work requirement if the bill provided the opportunity to pass Medicaid expansion in future years without the work requirement. They feared that a Democratic presidential administration or courts would reject a work requirement every year and expansion would never come to fruition.
As it turned out, though, Trump won the election, and congressional approval of his “Big Beautiful Bill”  makes the work requirement the law of the land.
Perhaps more onerous than the work requirement is the burdensome, often duplicative paperwork Medicaid recipients and others receiving federal aid must navigate and the fees recipients might have to pay to receive services. It almost seems “Big Beautiful Bill” supporters are opposed to people receiving health care.
The new law also has other components that are related to the 2024 Medicaid expansion debate in the Mississippi Legislature. Legislative Democrats had been trying for years to expand Medicaid. Republicans, with their supermajority, blocked those Medicaid expansion efforts.
But by 2024, new Republican House Speaker White and some other Mississippi Republican legislators, though not all, were amenable to some type of Medicaid expansion.
But other Republicans argued that Medicaid expansion was not needed because some of the working poor, though not the poorest, could receive private insurance through the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges with the federal government paying most of the costs.
Many hospital administrators argued the federal exchanges did not guarantee them as much of a revenue stream as did Medicaid expansion.
But those arguments now are moot because the Biden-era enhanced federal benefits that were provided for people who received insurance through the exchanges lapsed and were not extended by the “Big Beautiful Bill.”
But the upshot of all this is that despite Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” Mississippi still has an opportunity to expand Medicaid with the federal government paying most of the costs.
For poor working Mississippians with no health insurance and for struggling hospitals, that still could genuinely be a big, beautiful thing.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/11141857/3X0A2725.jpg,,,2025-07-13 08:05:51.279321

Read the story on VTDigger here:  High risks, low payouts: Vermont farmers say crop insurance falls short.","Justin Rich’s Burnt Rock Farm lost $200,000 last year, after floods covered entire fields on his riverside land in Huntington with water and debris. 
After paying his premiums to the federal government’s Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program, Rich received his payout. It was roughly $3,000 — less than two cents for every lost dollar.
“It doesn’t work terribly well on smaller, medium-scale, diversified farms like ours,” Rich said of the program.
The Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program is intended to provide recourse for farmers who don’t qualify for federal subsidies on insurance premiums for major crops such as corn, soybeans and apples. The program is not administered by a private provider like subsidized plans are; it’s a coverage service from the federal government itself.

For many farms in Vermont, a lack of access to subsidies and the small scale of their operations limit coverage options. Significant premiums and federal bureaucracy make many question whether the remaining choices are worthwhile. But as weather grows less predictable, the unchecked costs of crop disasters threaten the viability of farming in the state. 
Vermont growers whose crops qualify for traditional federal subsidies often find them helpful. Andrea Darrow, an owner of Green Mountain Orchards in Putney, said the federal apple subsidies are just enough to make premiums affordable for her. 
“We feel, like, so vulnerable without it,” she said.
When a bizarrely late frost in May 2023 destroyed 95% of Darrow’s crop, the insurance payout helped significantly with the cost of growing another crop. And the family-run business has successfully filed smaller claims on several other occasions.
But roughly 70% of the state’s farms carry no crop insurance, according to Vermont Agency of Agriculture Chief Operating Officer Nicole Dubuque.
Rich said he was surprised the number wasn’t higher. 
“Vermont’s agricultural scene is almost completely devoid of conventional grain crops,” he said.

Even some dairy farmers who grow silage corn as feed choose to forgo insurance. Earl Ransom, who owns Rockbottom Farm in Strafford, called the crop insurance industry a “scam.”
He said he prefers other methods of risk mitigation, some of which might not be an option for all farmers. Ransom doesn’t use riverbottom land and is able to produce more crop than he needs for his cows.
“The way that I farm is built on the idea of resiliency,” he said. 
Ransom and Rich agreed that the only ideal form of insurance at this stage is to have a personal buffer of money, land and crop yield.
But for most, that’s not the reality.
Dubuque said the state has been concerned for some time about the lack of options for Vermont growers to hedge their bets financially. 
Noninsured assistance premiums can be high, she explained, and federal payout calculations are sometimes affected by other regions of the country where it’s cheaper to grow crops.
There aren’t enough sweet potatoes grown in the state to develop a base price for Vermont, for example. So when Rich lost all his sweet potatoes last summer, he was given the national average price for them, which is “like an order of magnitude cheaper,” he said.
Rich also lost 34.5% of his potato crop, for which he’d paid higher premiums to get more coverage. The threshold for a payout, however, was 35%, he said.
The Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program’s administrative process can additionally burden farmers, with monthslong wait times for federal payouts, according to Rich. 
He said many small farmers who sell through farm stands and other informal venues may struggle to keep meticulous records and submit them. 
“It is not a small amount of paperwork,” Rich said.
Hank Bissell, owner of Lewis Creek Farm in Starksboro, said he tried only once, decades ago, to secure federal insurance for his farm. After a mountain of paperwork, he concluded that financially, “it wasn’t going to do me any good.”
So when the floods of 2023 and 2024 hit, the $120,000 loss Bissell endured was uninsured.
With little to no support from the federal level, he and Rich turned to the state. Both received grants from the Business Emergency Gap Assistance Program administered by the Agency of Commerce. 
BEGAP isn’t an agriculture program, but for both of them, it was a life raft.
“Very fast, very easy to apply for, and extremely useful for those of us affected,” Rich said.
Bissell said he was able to recoup 30% of his losses through the program, which prevented what could have been a financial catastrophe.
“We’ll live to gamble again,” he said.
In addition to the Agency of Commerce’s emergency provisions, state lawmakers introduced a bill during the last legislative session with the goal of establishing a ​​Farm Security Special Fund for farmers. 
One of the bill’s sponsors, Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, cited the difficulty of accessing other aid for small farms, as well as shifting climate patterns, as her rationale. 
“Having a fund that is designed specifically for farmers is an important tool to keep local agriculture viable in our state,” she said in an email.
The bill stalled in the Appropriations Committee, but lawmakers could raise the issue in the next legislative session.
Dubuque said any amount of further aid would be helpful, but that full recovery for farms after a disaster would require a significant pool of money. Expanding the Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program at the federal level could also be helpful, she said, especially if some of the administrative burden was lifted.
Tom Zacharias, president of National Crop Insurance Services, recommended that farmers also consider federal alternative insurance options like the Micro Farm Program and the Whole-Farm Revenue Protection program, which may provide diverse operations with more comprehensive coverage. 
A USDA report indicates no payouts had been made from either plan in Vermont during the 2024 crop year. Several farmers told VTDigger they had not considered these alternatives, or that both seemed prohibitively expensive.
U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., issued a statement Friday announcing that Vermont farmers affected by natural disasters in 2023 and 2024 can apply for expedited assistance through the USDA’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program. 
Over $16 billion in aid from the 2025 American Relief Act is set to go to farmers across the country, the release said. Only producers who received aid through the Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program or through subsidized crop insurance in 2023 and 2024 are currently eligible. 
Dubuque reiterated the central role of small-scale agriculture in Vermont, both for food and tourism. 
“Small farms in this state are so incredibly important to our economy,” she said.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paer on July 10.
Hidden treasures abound at the corner of Williston Road and Dorset Street.
From knick-knacks and clothing to home decor and ephemera, Vintage Inspired Marketplace has over 50 vendors who do the dirty work of sorting through the endless amounts of stuff out there in the world and bringing it directly to South Burlington.
Although the weather was sunny and above 75 this Independence Day weekend, that didn’t keep passersby from stopping in to check out what offerings were available. The suite in the building at 10 Dorset Street where the shop sits is roughly 4,500 square feet and is packed wall to wall with gazillions of oddities, some new but most old.
Vintage and antique aficionados around the Burlington area may remember the 12-year stint the multi-vendor business had on Flynn Avenue in Burlington’s South End before moving south in 2023.
While the business found its new home two years ago, it was first located in the back of the building. In May 2024, the business expanded and moved to the front, street-facing part of the building and brought in even more vendors.

Rebecca Wallace, the market’s owner and operator for the past two-years, stood greeting guests as they entered and exited, usually leaving with a handful — or two — of new finds. Part of the influx of business in the last year, Wallace said, is thanks to the new digs.
“The location, you can’t beat it. I mean, we’re very visible to everybody walking by,” Wallace said. “We’re much, much busier now than we ever were, of course, in the back of the building, and even down on Flynn Avenue, where we were very tucked away.”
Being tucked away was part of the concept for the business’ previous owner, sort of like a hidden gem or destination spot. But when Wallace bought the business in 2023, she pulled back the curtain, so to speak. It was her intention to bring about a new era for a place she had grown to love over the five years she was a vendor there.
She still runs Kitschy Business, her 20th century vintage goods, ephemera and nostalgia business, out of Vintage Inspired Marketplace, occupying the suite’s front space. Her corner hosts bookshelves stacked full of classics, collectibles and old children’s illustrated books, among other things.
Books, she said, are the hot commodity among customers. She pulled out a copy of Stephen King’s 1985 short story collection “Skeleton Crew,” obviously very well loved by its previous owner.
“I’m surprised this is still here,” she said. “Reading is definitely not dead.”
Wallace said she’s almost always been a collector of old stuff but mostly had an affinity for paper — so much that, at one point, she had amassed a library of nearly 2,000 vintage children’s books. But collecting is just part of the craft, and always ensuring there’s a backstock for things that are sold is another part to it.
“The interesting part is all the fun stuff that comes in. I love going through it,” she said. “I’m a big sorter, so I love all the jewelry and buttons and stuff like that that comes in. I just got this huge lot of matchbooks from New York City and Los Angeles from, like, the 80s and 90s.”
There’s a certain type of knowledge that goes into selling, she explained, like learning prominent makers or markings. But she admits it’s impossible to know everything about everything.
“People kind of expect you to have a certain base of knowledge about certain items, at least, like the more popular stuff,” she said.
Sometimes, she buys things she knows she won’t make a lot of money on just because she wants it to pass through her store. There’s value in having people remember the market for stirring up fond memories that way.
While the place may be easier on your pocketbook than some antique stores, it’s a far cry from a junk store. Wallace has carefully designed the space since moving sellers in, but each vendor takes the curating into their own hands. Wallace drafted by hand where each space could go, how big each section could be and, more importantly, how to fit everyone in.
Still, the waiting list of vendors is upwards of 70 people long.
“There’s a really high demand for places like this,” she said.
The business stands in stark contrast to the Target just down Dorset Street. And while sorting through all the nooks and crannies to find the perfect gift or new salt and pepper shakers may not be as convenient, it is intentional.
In a world of convenience and never-ending sale racks, sometimes spending a Saturday checking out someone’s once loved treasures can remind you of some place, some person or some memory that you once loved too.
“It’s a happy place coming in here,” Wallace said. “People have good associations and memories with the things that they see. You know, ‘Grandma had that,’ or whatever.”

Where do revenue bills begin?
North Dakota’s inaugural civics bee challenged middle school students with difficult questions as it aimed to promote greater participation and education surrounding political engagement.
The Greater North Dakota Chamber sponsored the event Friday in Bismarck, with the winner advancing to a national competition.
Arik Spencer, president of the Greater North Dakota Chamber, said low voter turnout across the country prompted the organization to partner with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation to encourage more interest in civics education.
Spencer said questions are designed to be difficult to challenge the competitors.
“The person in first place would do well in a college civics class,” he said. “This is not basic level knowledge. This is kind of a deep dive into civics. I’ve been so impressed with the students who are responding to it.”
Six state finalists competed during the event at the University of Mary, answering 20 multiple-choice civics questions.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
Clara Zheng, a soon-to-be eighth grader from Erik Ramstad Middle School in Minot, answered 16 questions correctly, more than her competitors – and some adult audience members. She then presented and defended her previously prepared essay on teenage mental health concerns before a panel of judges.
Zheng will represent North Dakota at the National Civics Bee in November, the first time the state has sent a contestant.
“I feel so honored to go to nationals and represent my state,” Zheng said.
Zheng said having good civic virtues in communities and an understanding of government is important in every society.
Rep. Karen Karls, R-Bismarck, who attended the event, said the questions asked of the students were extremely difficult. 
“That’s amazing for middle school-level kids,” Karls said. “I got a few correct answers, but not nearly as many as I should have.”
Hilary Crow, vice president of civics at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, said competitors receive an extensive study guide and access to a virtual learning library to prepare.
Crow said a pilot civics competition started in 2022 with five sites and has grown to 40 states competing.
“All 50 states will be participating next year,” she said. 
The National Civics Bee, hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation in Washington, D.C., will be held Nov. 10-11. The winner of the national competition will receive a $100,000 college savings plan while the second and third place finishers will receive college savings plans of $25,000 and $15,000.
“It’s one of our sacred duties to get the government we hope we deserve, so we’re excited to put this on and kick this off for North Dakota,” Spencer said. “This is going to be a big deal for North Dakota and hopefully a big deal for the future of our country in terms of getting people engaged in civics.”

The lawyer’s email arrived at 12:20 p.m. on June 2 in the inbox of Courtney Cullinan, the chief of staff to Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven. It contained proposed legislative language that would benefit two of the lawyer’s clients who had regulatory and competitive problems in Connecticut’s solid-waste industry.
It was crunch time for the General Assembly, just four hours before the House of Representatives would open debate on a freshly drafted 745-page bill implementing a two-year $55.8 billion budget. The adjournment deadline for the five-month legislative session was just two days away, midnight on June 4.
The language provided by Joseph Mazzarella of McCarter & English — a law firm that employs New Haven’s influential Democratic chair, Vincent Mauro Jr., who is in a relationship with Cullinan and preceded her as chief  — would boost one client’s struggle to reopen a troubled Wallingford transfer station and help another block a competitor from buying a transfer facility in Torrington.
At Mauro’s suggestion, the email also went to another friend, someone with whom he had negotiated previous budget implementers during his time as a top legislative staffer: Franklin Perry, the chief of staff for House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford.
What happened next was a case study of the opaque and often chaotic nature of finalizing a budget in Connecticut — and the opportunities to do favors by shaping public policy, changing laws and sidestepping regulatory proceedings, all with little vetting or accountability.
Mazzarella’s language found its way into a nine-line, 77-word portion of a 65-page amendment produced soon after his email arrived. It was a legislative staff assemblage reflecting input from various sources that made myriad last-minute additions and subtractions to the budget implementer, House Bill 7287.
Such a narrowly tailored favor that arrives with no public vetting is known at the state Capitol as a “rat.” How Mazzarella’s proposed language got from the mailboxes of Cullinan and Perry to lines 121 to 129 in an amendment to HB 7287 is a story no one wants to tell.
The amendment was adopted on a 100-46 vote at 7:31 p.m., and the revised budget implementer passed four minutes before midnight, 99-43. No member of the Republican minority voted for the amendment or final bill.
Who did it?
No one has taken responsibility for placing the language in the implementer. Typically, any such additions are removed if opposed by either the governor’s office,  the House and Senate majorities, and in some years the Republican minorities as well. 
“Toward the end of session, any number of issues arise to be potentially added to the implementer. A provision will often be included if there are no objections from the House, the Senate, or the administration,”  Looney said. “Everyone has a veto.”
But the absence of an objection is not the same as an affirmation, and Ritter and Looney acknowledge a certain casual deference to items placed into the implementer by another caucus or branch of government, especially if they are not obviously counter to the interests of another.
“It’s hard to just quote, unquote, sneak something in without people noticing,” said Ritter. He conceded not everything gets flagged by staff for leadership at crunch time. “You have to triage what’s of most importance to either your caucus or your chair or your leadership.”
Two years ago, a freshman House Republican managed to get a single sentence included in the 832-page state budget that blocked a warehouse distribution project near his neighborhood in Middlebury.
One major difference with the Middlebury rat is that every legislative caucus leader and the governor’s chief of staff eventually acknowledged to the Connecticut Mirror that they were aware of the measure, and it was a favor admittedly sought on the freshman’s behalf by the House Republicans leader, Vincent J. Candelora.
This year, no legislative caucus is claiming credit or accepting blame for the trash rat, the governor’s office denied agreeing to its inclusion, and Looney, Ritter, Candelora and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, say they were unaware of its consequences when the amendment was finalized. 
“No one approached me,” Looney said.
A wide range of local officials and legislators who had been tracking the fate of the Torrington transfer station, which was owned by a public entity slated for extinction on July 1, said they were shocked to learn of it.
Among them was Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, whose district includes communities whose trash goes to the Torrington transfer station. Nominally a sponsor of the amendment as co-chair of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, she also was tasked with offering and defending it on the House floor.
Her first effort to describe the amendment took 25 seconds. She said it simply adopted revenue projections accepted that morning by the finance committee and made “technical revisions and corrections.”

Republicans immediately complained the amendment was nearly incomprehensible without a painstaking analysis, one that would take hours to complete. It was packed with terse references to changes in the underlying budget bill:
“In line 493, strike “$110,400” and insert “$115,000” in lieu thereof
In line 520, strike “ninety-nine million six hundred thousand” and insert “one hundred one million” in lieu thereof
In line 521, strike “ninety-three million three hundred thousand” and insert “ninety million” in lieu thereof ” …
Under legislative rules, the budget bill must be available in the legislature’s public data system for review for 12 hours, even if some of those hours were prior to sunrise. There is no 12-hour rule for a budget amendment.
“We got this amendment no less than 10 minutes ago,” Rep. Jay Case, R-Torrington, told Horn. He noted a hard-to-decipher reference to the Torrington transfer station and a non-existent “Northwest Resource Recovery Authority” and asked, “And why is it in this document?”
Horn consulted staff and looked at the amendment. Forty seconds passed. Deputy Speaker Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, who was presiding, prodded her to answer.
“Rep. Horn?” Mushinsky said.
“Just clarifying the information to make sure I’m — mostly correct what this section of the bill refers to,” Horn replied.
It became obvious to Republicans that the respected Democratic insider had not possessed the amendment much longer than the GOP outsiders quizzing her. That proved too much for Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee.

“I would really love to do a hands-raised of how many people have read it — before the vote gets done,” Nuccio said. “Or if we’re just voting blindly here, because this isn’t even the blind friggin’ leading the blind. It is deceptively blind.”
Horn said last week that Nuccio was correct in her assessment.
“I thought I knew what was in it,” Horn said. “I had notes as to what was in it, but they were not complete, I regret to say.”
The amendment was far from merely technical. It moved millions of dollars around the budget, duplicated bills that had been passed by the House but might not clear the Senate, and did two significant favors for Mazzarella’s clients, Country Holdings and Enviro Express.
At the time, Country Holdings was trying to negotiate a consent agreement with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to resolve violations, a first step to considering a permit to reopen a Wallingford transfer station it acquired in 2019 and closed in 2023. The amended budget directed DEEP to immediately issue a temporary permit.
A DEEP spokesman says the legislative directive to issue a temporary permit to Country Holdings in Wallingford came without warning and is without “modern precedent.” The temporary permit would have come before the typical review of an applicant’s finances and engineering drawings, as well as an assessment of the environmental impact on the host community by odor, noise and traffic.
(Last week, DEEP told the Connecticut Mirror the attorney general had advised the provision as written is not enforceable, and no temporary permit can be issued.)
A list obtained Thursday in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act shows that Mazzarella, Mauro and Cullinan were participants in a video meeting on Dec. 13, 2024, to discuss issues at the Wallingford site with Commissioner Katie Dykes and other DEEP officials.

Whether Cullinan played a role beyond facilitating a meeting with the commissioner is unclear, as is the case for Mauro. He is a lobbyist at McCarter & English, but he was not registered to represent either Country Holdings or its owner, Richard Antonucci Jr.
Neither Cullinan nor Mauro have agreed to on-the-record interviews since June 28, when CT Mirror first reported the inclusion of the language sought by Mazzarella on behalf of Country Holdings and Enviro Express. Cullinan’s only on-the-record comment came in that story, when she said,  “I heard about it, but I am not necessarily familiar with it.” 
Perry, the other Democratic chief of staff, did not respond to requests for comment.
Mauro has referred inquiries to Mazzarella. With regard to the legislative language that ended up in the budget implementer, Mazzarella said that Mauro’s only role was to tell him who should get the proposed amendment language helping his clients.
“I was very aware of not implicating anything related to the legislation,” Mazzarella said, noting Mauro was not registered to lobby for Country or Enviro. “So the only thing I ever asked the guy was, ‘Who are the right people to write a letter to?’” 
He then wrote to Cullinan and Perry.
The paper trail ends there.
The Torrington issue
The Torrington issue is complicated, arising from a months-long debate over the disposition of transfer stations in Essex and Torrington that had been owned by MIRA, the Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority. Enviro Express operated the Torrington facility by contract.
With the closure in 2022 of MIRA’s primary asset, an aging trash-to-energy plant in Hartford’s South Meadows that once incinerated one-third of Connecticut’s municipal solid waste, the successor MIRA Dissolution Authority, or MDA, was winding down operations and selling assets. 
A non-controversial ratification of MDA’s agreement to transfer ownership and permits of the Essex station to the host community already was in the implementer bill. Control over Torrington was not.
Most, but not all, of the communities under contract with MIRA to send their waste to Torrington had been working on a public option, rather than selling the transfer station to a private company in what has been a rapidly consolidating trash industry, both in Connecticut and nationally.
The Northwest Hills Council of Governments, which includes Torrington and 20 other communities, thought the region had the framework of a deal in February, when the MDA board approved a non-binding agreement for Northwest Hills to take it over by June 30, the day before dissolution authority would cease to exist. 
But in May, the MDA board agreed to conditionally accept a $3.25 million offer from USA Waste & Recycling, a major family-owned Connecticut company that contracts with municipalities for curbside waste and recycling collection and processes that material at its transfer stations and a recycling sorting plant.

Trash haulers dump their loads on the tipping floor in the waste processing side of the former MIRA trash-to-energy plant in Hartford’s South Meadows.

Paul Harrington, an MDA board member and town manager of the Northwest Connecticut town of Winchester, said the public authority envisioned for a region of 113,000 people spread over 786 miles was not sustainable and would require a subsidy to launch.
USA offered a long-term contract with cheaper rates and would generate revenue from the sale, not require a subsidy.
“We were in the middle of negotiating the sale to a private company, and, boom, they dropped the rat on us,” Harrington said. 
USA issued a statement saying, “The MDA determined our plan would deliver stable, affordable rates for 5 to 10 years, and contribute $3.25 million toward cleaning up the MIRA South Meadows facility. Each community would have the option to participate and determine the length of that participation at their sole discretion.”
“In contrast,” the company said, “the public option was never publicly vetted, depends on an approximately $6 million taxpayer subsidy, includes no funding for environmental remediation, and would result in tipping fees at least $10 higher per ton for local residents, which would increase after the expiration of the subsidy.”

If sold to USA, the proceeds would have gone to the cleanup of the MIRA site in Hartford, a relatively small contribution toward the tens of millions expected to be needed to demolish the former trash-to-energy plant and remediate a polluted site by the Connecticut River adjacent to a park, either for recreation or redevelopment.
Mazzarella didn’t object to the characterization of his legislative language as a rat, but he insisted it was a good rat — serving a public purpose by keeping the Torrington permit in public hands, as Torrington Mayor Elinor Carbone and other northwest community officials desired.
“There should always be a public option,” Carbone said. “Our concern was private industry, you know, might make a sweet, attractive introductory offer on the prices. But as we all know, anybody who signed up for a good cable plan, after that introductory period is over, you have no control over those prices.”
Still, Carbone said was shocked by the legislative action, as was Rob Phillips, the executive director of the region’s council of governments. 
“I think it had something to do with the attorney for Enviro  knowing somebody who through the political framework was able to draft that legislation and get it in,” Phillips said. “I still don’t even know all the names involved.”
Carbone was in an executive session at a council meeting on June 2 when Rep. Joe Canino, R-Torrington, texted with an urgent request that she call him. Canino wanted to know if Carbone knew anything about the amendment. She didn’t.
Canino, a first-term legislator, was confused by a reference in the amendment to control of the Torrington permit, not the facility’s ownership. He thought the ownership fight over once the MDA board unanimously voted to sell to USA.
“My mayor had come to me and asked if there was anything we could do months ago,” Canino said. “And I thought the deal’s signed, sealed and delivered. It was done according to their bylaws. There’s nothing we can do.”
The border of two state Senate districts run through Torrington: one represented by Harding, the Republican minority leader; the other by a freshman Democrat, Sen. Paul Honig of Harwinton. Both say they were not told what was coming in the amendment.
 “I think it was a pleasant surprise,” Harding said. “I think the feedback I’ve gotten from municipal officials in my district is they believe this is a real opportunity to help find a more affordable and more environmentally efficient option to address waste control in the northwest corner, which is becoming a growing problem.”
Horn, whose district includes many of the Northwest Hills communities desiring a public option, said she also likes the outcome — but not the method. So did Canino and Harding.
“I would agree that rats are not the best way to do public policy,” Canino said.
So whom does he have to thank?
“I have no idea,” Canino said.
“It’s a little bit of a mystery,” Honig said.
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, who hustled to the Capitol before the session ended to see if the USA sale and $3.25 million for the Hartford cleanup could be salvaged, said the House speaker initially was hopeful, but he first had to determine who was behind putting the rat in the budget implementer.

“Everybody was just trying to figure out where it came from. It’s like chasing this rabbit around the Capitol,” Arulampalam said. 
Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, who is Senate finance committee co-chair and a member of the MDA board, said the amendment “throws a grenade” into what was to be orderly transition in Torrington. While a new public authority will hold the permit, ownership has defaulted to the state Department of Administrative Services.
Fonfara said he, too, was blindsided by the amendment. Despite its impact on Hartford and his role on Finance, Revenue and Bonding, no one flagged it. He said he was told a fix was coming, but none came when the Senate approved the budget the next day.
Ultimately, Ritter said, he will look for other funding to remediate the Hartford site.
Carbone said she is sympathetic if Arulampalam feels victimized by the confusing episode, as she felt after MDA stopped negotiating with her and suddenly endorsed a sale to USA.
“It was all pretty ugly,” Carbone said. “I guess you could say there were a lot of rats.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MIRA-DISSOLUTION-0630-DE-089-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-13 05:02:05.827082

The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season has arrived, and while New England is no stranger to the impact of powerful storms, more than 30 years have passed since a hurricane officially made landfall in the region (the last one to make a direct hit was Hurricane Bob in 1991). Even though hurricanes are rare in New England, we know all too well that a tropical storm system doesn’t have to be a hurricane to have devastating effects. We also know that when it comes to our unpredictable weather, “expect the unexpected” is the best policy, which is why storm preparedness is a top priority and year-round focus at Eversource. 
“As we’ve seen many times here in Connecticut, extreme weather can hit hard and cause significant damage just as it can anywhere else in the country, so we know how crucial it is to always be prepared—especially during hurricane season,” says Eversource President of Connecticut Electric Operations Steve Sullivan.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting above-normal activity for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends November 30. NOAA is forecasting a 60% chance of an above-normal season, with six to ten hurricanes having winds of 74 miles an hour or higher, and three to five major hurricanes with winds of 111 miles an hour or higher. 
“We’ve been meeting to discuss NOAA’s hurricane season forecast, and review and update our storm response protocols accordingly, but preparing for storms is something we do year-round,” says Sullivan.
The energy company works to safeguard the electric grid through system upgrades, maintenance, and proactive vegetation management to ensure reliability for customers. Trimming and removing hazard trees that threaten overhead electric lines are not only crucial to providing customers with reliable power in all types of weather, they’re also fundamental to emergency preparedness, as trees cause more than 90% of power outages during storms. 
“When a storm is approaching our area,” Sullivan explains, “we monitor multiple forecasts and ensure that our crews and equipment are ready to go, so they can respond as quickly and safely as possible to get customers back online if they do lose power.”
In advance of storms, Eversource can quickly bring on contractors to assist with power restoration. The energy company is also part of the electric industry’s mutual aid network, which connects hundreds of utilities and contract crew workforces across the United States and Canada. This critical system can be called upon to supplement Eversource’s highly skilled crews with trained workers and specialized equipment to speed restoration. 
“This network is a cornerstone of utility response during emergencies,” says Sullivan. “When a strong storm impacts our state, we rely on this extensive network of outside crews to help restore power to customers, and we’re always ready to return the favor. Last year, a contingent of our dedicated lineworkers made the journey down South to join the restoration effort in the wake of Hurricane Helene, and we couldn’t be prouder of how they stepped up to answer the call for help.”
That type of commitment from Eversource lineworkers—and lineworkers across North America—is just one example of how collaboration is key to successful emergency preparedness and response. 
“Storm response is not a one-person job. It takes constant coordination with emergency management, public safety officials, first responders, and community leaders to execute the best level of response for our customers, and we encourage them to take steps to prepare as well.”
Eversource offers several simple tips and steps customers can take to help prepare for hurricane season at home. The energy company provides a storm safety checklist and encourages customers to always have an emergency plan in place, assemble a storm kit with essential items, plan a meeting place for family members, and be ready to check on neighbors. Customers can also download Eversource’s mobile app or sign up for the company’s two-way texting to report and check outages.

The comic is on a counter, placed over another Superman publication, at Prairie Dog Comics in Wichita. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)I walked into Prairie Dog Comics in Wichita looking for a hero.
Not just any hero, but the quintessential American superhero, the Man of Steel himself, an extraterrestrial refugee from the planet Krypton who made his debut in 1938, single-handedly shaped the comic book as we know it and spawned an $8 billion franchise. In various iterations he represented the New Deal, fought Nazis, celebrated Reagan-era patriotism, died and was resurrected, and broke the fourth wall of the comics panel after Sept. 11 to lament to readers that he was only a fictional character and could not help in real life.
For most of his stories — and there are many, in comics and radio and television and movies, some with complicated and competing timelines — the infant Superman is taken in by a kindly farm couple named Kent and raised at Smallville, a fictional town in Kansas. This week a major Superman movie is rebooting the myth for a new generation, and I’d come to the comics shop on Maple Street in west Wichita looking for clues to what makes Superman perennially popular.
I’ll admit up front that I have never much liked Superman except when I was a small child, because he could fly. The 1978 movie with Christopher Reeve seemed a bit silly to me, but I was 20 at the time, deep into Hemingway’s Nick Adams, and beyond all that kid stuff. My comics tastes ran more to “Heavy Metal” magazine and, later, “Watchmen” writer Alan Moore.
I haven’t paid much attention to the Superman franchise in years, but in the last few weeks I’ve been pondering the nature of heroes and myth and just why things seem so hopeless in America. What would the new Superman movie have to say to us? 
But Wednesdays are release day in the comics world and Prairie Dog Comics is doing such a steady business that I have to time my questions between customers. The shop is unassuming at first glance, with tired carpet and decor that looks as if it might be 20 or even 40 years old, but the place is crammed full of boxes and shelves and display racks of stock. You soon come to realize the shop takes its comics as seriously as anybody who took “Big Two-Hearted River” as a lesson not just in writing but in life.
Adam Rittel, the man behind the counter ringing up all those first-day releases of Spiderman and Flash, is a self-described “slinger of comics.” He says he doesn’t know much about Superman but then betrays an impressive grasp of the various universes the Man of Steel inhabits. He rattles off half a dozen story arcs. I’m unable to keep up.
Then he shows me a new movie tie-in facsimile edition of Action Comics No. 210 from 1955, featuring the first appearance of Krypto the superdog. It’s sealed in a polybag. Slipped into two copies of the comic is a “Golden Biscuit” that confers the right to attend the world premiere of the new movie in Los Angeles with its writer and director, James Gunn. He is probably most widely known for a 2014 superhero film, “Guardians of the Galaxy.”
Has the new movie spurred interest in Superman?
“Yes and no,” Rittel says. “There’s always the push when there’s a promotion.”
Has he read any reviews of the new movie?
Rittel doesn’t read reviews.
If I really want to know about Superman, he suggests, I should talk to his brother, John.
I give Rittel my cell number and he agrees to relay a message.
Meanwhile, I buy the facsimile edition of Action Comics No. 210. Once freed from its polybag, I discover I am not, in fact, a winner of the Golden Biscuit. I’ll have to see the new Superman movie without its director.
I’ve soured on the glut of recent superhero movies, except perhaps for Iron Man, because they all seem the same: all CGI spectacle and little story. But I’m hoping the new Superman movie will be different. It stars David Corenswet as you-know-who and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane. It is being promoted not only as a reboot of the Superman film franchise, but as a reimagining of the DC Universe.
It’s also being knocked by some as being too political.
Dean Cain, who played Superman on television in the 1990s, said Gunn’s version was too “woke.” Superman as an immigrant was being pushed too hard. Right-wing commentators, including Kellyanne Conway, have said the movie is too ideological, but Gunn and some of the cast shrugged off criticism and said the movie was about kindness.
The film is from DC Studios, a division of Warner Bros. Discovery that creates live action and animated content based on characters from the DC Comics, including the Joker, Batman and Wonder Woman.
But the star of the DC Universe, back to 1938, has always been Superman.
The Man of Steel debuted in Action Comics No. 1, in June 1938, but Superman didn’t even get the full issue — although he did get the now iconic cover of hoisting a car over his head. Action Comics was an anthology with 11 separate features, but now the only story you’ll likely recognize in it is Superman’s. Published by “Detective Comics” — later known as DC — It was the first comic to feature a superhero. It went for 10 cents in 1938. Last year, an original copy sold at auction for $6 million.
“Superheroes are a typological category and a cultural truth,” writes Hillary Chute in her 2017 book, “Why Comics?”
“Perhaps the enduring appeal can be traced to the origin story of superheroes themselves,” Chute argues, “which itself feels like an archetypal superhero storyline. The world’s inaugural superhero is Superman, also known as Clark Kent (birth name: Kal-El, likewise the name actor Nicolas Cage gave his son), and as a character he had modest beginnings. Superman was the brainchild of two shy, bespectacled, lower-middle-class Jewish teenagers from Ohio, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, whose first incarnation of the character appeared in their own self-published magazine (or “zine”) in the 1930s.”
Siegel was the writer and Shuster was the artist.
Detective Comics bought all rights from Siegel and Shuster for $130.
“Superman was immediately hugely popular,” Chute notes, “selling out the print run of ‘Action Comics.’ Siegel and Shuster cast him as a ‘champion of the oppressed’ — he has been called a junior New Dealer. In his first storyline, for instance, Superman saves a falsely accused prisoner from a lynch mob, produces evidence that frees an innocent woman from death row, and defends a woman about to be abused by her husband.”
There were Sunday funnies heroes before — Doc Savage, for example, and Dick Tracy — but with Superman came superpowers. The transcending of the limitations of human ability likely had something to do with the economic pressures of the Great Depression and war jitters caused by worsening situations in Europe and East Asia.
Art Spiegelman, best-known for “Maus,” the graphic novel depicting his family’s suffering during the Holocaust but with the characters cast as mice and the Nazis as cats, argued in a 2019 piece in The Guardian that the golden age of comics superheroes was shaped by the rise of fascism.
“The young Jewish creators of the first superheroes conjured up mythic — almost god-like — secular saviours to deal with the threatening economic dislocations that surrounded them in the great depression and gave shape to their premonitions of impending global war,” Spiegelman wrote. “Comics allowed readers to escape into fantasy by projecting themselves on to invulnerable heroes. Auschwitz and Hiroshima make more sense as dark comic book cataclysms than as events in our real world. In today’s all too real world, Captain America’s most nefarious villain, the Red Skull, is alive on screen and an Orange Skull haunts America. International fascism again looms large.”
The Superman origin story also keys into what Joseph Campbell called “the monomyth,” the hero’s journey told in every culture around the world. It features a protagonist born of mysterious circumstances, in possession of special powers or skills, who is raised by surrogate parents and eventually brings some boon to mankind. Not coincidentally, the hero’s journey is often a cornerstone of religious or cultural narratives, including the stories of Moses and King Arthur, Jesus and Luke Skywalker.
While Superman was associated from nearly the start with Smallville, where lived a kindly farm couple who found and raised him, it wasn’t until the 1978 Superman movie that Smallville identified as being in Kansas, something that is now canon. Every June, Hutchinson in south-central Kansas “changes” its name to Smallville and has a festival weekend that includes a comic con at the state fairgrounds. The Smallville Wiki lists its zip code as 67524, in real life the postal coordinate for Chase, a town in Rice County.
Directed by Richard Donner, the 1978 film featured Marlon Brando as Superman’s real father and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. It was notable for its special effects, the now-iconic John Williams score, and Gene Hackman’s over-the-top performance as Lex Luthor. In a 1978 interview in the Edmonton Journal, Donner said his movie was true to the “legend and myth” of Superman’s origin story, including his upbringing in Kansas.
In the 1990s, there was the television series “Lois and Clark: the New Adventures of Superman,” and “Smallville” ran from 2001 to 2011. Despite differences in interpretation, the essentials of the story remained the same: Kansas, the Clark Kent/Superman duality, Clark and Lois as reporters, and Luthor as nemesis.
Siegel, the comics writer who created Superman, died in 1996, age 81. He had married Joanne Carter, the teenage model who first posed for Lois Lane in 1935 after answering a classified ad by Shuster, the artist co-creator.
Shuster died in 1992. He was 78. Even though DC bought all rights to their superhero in 1938, the publishing company gave each man an annuity of $20,000 after the 1978 movie was released, according to the New York Times.
What makes the Superman story so enduring?
“It’s a sense of right and wrong,” John Rittel, Adam’s brother, told me on the phone. “There’s a deep morality. It’s hard to put into words, but it’s about power and responsibility. Using power responsibly is something we should all be able to agree upon. It’s a symbol of hope, something you can gather around.”
John, a 42-year-old Wichita resident who says he has 31,000 comic books stored in his basement, said he’s been a fan of Superman since watching “Lois and Clark” as a kid.
“I’ve never seen an iteration (of Superman) I didn’t like,” he said. “Every one that comes out is someone’s first. And you always remember the first one you saw. … And James Gunn? In my eyes, he’s never failed. He’s always put out good stuff.”
John had not yet seen the new movie but planned to go with friends the next day.
How did he feel about the controversy over immigration?
“There’s got to be an element of truth,” he said, and it has to be relevant to the times in which it’s made. “People on one side or the other will think it’s too political, but if it opens people’s eyes …”
Can an 87-year-old fictional extraterrestrial migrant superhero raised in Kansas still be relevant?
My wife, Kim, and I saw “Superman” Thursday night. The movie opens 30 years after Kal-El comes to earth as a child — and yes, he is still adopted by a Kansas farm couple — and takes off from there. Most of the furniture from previous iterations is there, from the Daily Planet to the Fortress of Solitude, although updated a bit for the early 21st Century. Superman is battling a new version of Lex Luthor, played by Nicholas Hoult, a high tech arms-dealing billionaire who mostly rails about “the alien,” Superman.
The first 30 minutes of the film were full of character development, with Brosnahan doing the best Lois Lane of the franchise. She convincingly plays a reporter, doesn’t need saving, and seems conflicted in a realistic way about her relationship with Clark/Kal El.
Corenswet is so trusting as Superman that it’s a plot point. I liked him as Superman fine. He had the same naive charm that Reeve did.
There was a noisy 13 hours (or so it seemed) of Superman and his friends participating in a series of CGI battles, with many twists but few surprises. These kinds of digital sequences bore me because when you can do anything with 1s and 0s, without advancing the plot, nothing really matters. Give me old-fashioned practical effects every time.
But the real star of the movie is Superman’s dog, Krypto.
Kim pointed out to me that Krypto is like Toto in the “Wizard of Oz,” another movie spectacle, made (in color!) in 1939. In both cases, it’s the heroes’ love for their dogs that makes us root for them. Those dogs also engage us by making us feel discomfort when they’re in danger and joy when they’re happy.
This “Superman” is as formulaic as the ones that preceded it. Any resemblance to current events is just window dressing, so there’s not much to object to, no matter what side of the theater aisle you’re on. But I suspect the ultimate success of the Superman franchise depends on its predictability. You know that ultimately, good will prevail. It’s just that this time, it takes a little help from an extraterrestrial dog.

Not that anything you might have said would have made a difference to the inevitable:  a 5% fare hike on September 1st of this year and another 5% jump in July of 2026.  But don’t blame the railroad or Connecticut Department of Transportation.


You should really blame the legislature.  The budget they wrote this year practically required a fare increase as they under-funded the CDOT’s operating budget requests for our trains… Metro-North, Shore Line East and The Hartford Line.
So these recent hearings on a “proposed” fare increase were really for show, required by law, but mostly “political theater” (as I described it 12 years ago).
I’ve been through this charade before, attending and testifying at many, many such hearings over the past 25 years… all with the same outcome:  what was proposed was always what happened. This round, I didn’t even bother.
So why does the agency even go to the time and expense of this exercise when we know the inevitable?
Why do they prepare a 25-page Service Equity Analysis (in two languages) explaining the impact of the increased ticket costs on the poor and minorities?
Why does a team of CDOT managers travel across the state, holding these fare hearings in-person and online, basically signaling to the few people who show up to testify that they’ve wasted their time… that anything they might say can’t stop what’s coming down the track?
That seems like such a waste of the agency’s talents.  These CDOT managers want to run a good railroad but aren’t adequately funded by lawmakers.  The railroad takes the heat but shouldn’t take the blame as they were given no real choice but to raise the fares.
Sure, alternatively, they could cut service, but nobody wants that.
While the CDOT staff did not share any analysis of the effect of higher fares on ridership, they did remind us that in the last seven years fares have only gone up 14% while inflation has hit us with a 28% jump.
If fares must go up, what riders would really want would be more service and faster trains, maybe even a Quiet Car.  But the CDOT can’t deliver on those dreams.
The problem is that fares don’t even come close to covering the cost of running a railroad.  Pre-pandemic Metro-North boasted a 70+% “farebox return,” meaning that most of the operating costs for the trains were covered by ticket revenue.
But we all know what happened to ridership in the past five years.  And while it is slowly building back up (it’s up 6% in the past six months since congestion pricing began), the farebox return today is only about 38%.  Someone has to make up the difference: us riders.
And those millions of dollars being collected in tolls from drivers in midtown Manhattan?  Those can only be spent on capital improvements, not subsidies for operating costs, i.e. lowering fares.
For New York City-bound commuters, there’s little choice.  They’re a captive audience of 23,000 daily riders dealing with a monopoly that can raise prices without really  losing customers.
Driving isn’t an option, especially with an additional $9 toll now added to your daily drive into Manhattan.  And work from home was great, while it lasted.  But now you have to show up at the office in person at least a few days a week.
The CDOT now will analyze the testimony from the hearings and issue a final recommendation to the Commissioner, who will make the fare hike official.
So when your ticket price jumps, don’t blame the conductor.  Blame your elected officials for under-funding this crucial transportation resource.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ctdot-2025cover-2-1024x857.jpg,,,2025-07-13 05:02:05.827082

Hilleary, a Republican, told the crowd he is running to “ensure President (Donald) Trump has backup.”
“At the national level, I think our country in many ways is hanging on by its fingertips,” he said. “Our nation has been on a slow decline for years and that decline has been gaining steam during the Biden years.”
Hilleary said the Biden administration found “new and dangerous ways to tear down the traditional and normal symbols of this country.”
He also said Democrats had attacked Second Amendment rights and suppressed public speech — particularly regarding Covid vaccination information — criticized Biden immigration policies and addressed the issue of transgender athletes playing college sports.

Hilleary was elected to represent Tennessee’s 4th District in 1994 and served through 2002, when he narrowly lost his race for governor to Democrat Phil Bredesen. In 2006, he came in third in a three-way Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. 
He has served as chief of staff to Rose — who is running for governor in 2026 — since Rose’s 2018 election and Rose introduced Hilleary at Friday’s event, emphasizing Hilleary’s credentials as a former congressman. 
“When your chief of staff is a former Congressman, he’s held in particularly high regard,” Rose said.
Hilleary won his first election amid a conservative backlash to the policies of President Bill Clinton that ushered in a Republican House Majority for the first time in decades. He told the crowd at his kickoff he voted against Clinton administration policies more than any other member of Congress during his tenure.
About 350 people turned out at Friday’s event in Sumner County. Elected officials attending included state Sen. Paul Bailey and Rep. Paul Sherrell, both Sparta Republicans, Rep. Michael Hale, a Smithville Republican, Hendersonville Mayor Jamie Clary and Republican National Committee Committee Member Beth Campbell. 
State Rep. Johnny Garrett, a Goodlettsville Republican who serves as House Majority Whip, announced his candidacy for the District 6 seat on Tuesday. Other candidates to announce so far are Republican Dale Braden and Democrat Mike Croley.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) would require immigration enforcement officers to display clearly visible identification during public-facing enforcement actions.
The Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement, or VISIBLE, Act of 2025 would apply to Department of Homeland Security personnel, including Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as other federal agents detailed to immigration operations and deputized state or local officers.
The identification would be required to be clearly legible and include the agency name or initials and either the officer’s name or badge number.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Face coverings would also be prohibited, with exceptions for environmental hazards or covert operations.
Slotkin’s office called the bill a “narrow, commonsense transparency measure to promote professionalism and public trust.”
“In recent months, we have seen police, wearing hoodies and masks, make arrests that look more like kidnappings in an authoritarian country,” Slotkin said. “With a growing number of reports of individuals impersonating ICE officers in recent months, this measure is more important than ever — not just for our national security but for the safety of border states like Michigan.”
A press release said visible identification “helps reduce miscommunication during enforcement encounters, strengthens officer credibility, and improves public cooperation, all of which are vital to mission success.”
Slotkin partnered with U.S. Sens. Alex Padilla of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, both also Democrats, on the legislation.
The bill is co-sponsored by 10 other Democratic senators, including Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.).
A factsheet for the bill points to an “unprecedented escalation of militarized tactics” by the administration of President Donald Trump, including recent operations in California like in Pasadena where an agent reportedly exited an unmarked vehicle in the middle of the road and aimed his pistol at a group of pedestrians without identifying himself.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-09-121502-1024x676.png,,,2025-07-12 18:10:07.599158
