(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Alina Habba, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, announced her resignation Monday as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor, a week after a U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals panel disqualified her from the job.
Habba, though, won’t walk away unemployed. She said she will serve as senior adviser to Attorney General Pamela Bondi on U.S. attorney matters.
“As a result of the Third Circuit’s ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down from my role as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey,” Habba said in a statement. “But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”
She also left the door open to returning, saying she’s awaiting further review of the court’s ruling.
Trump named Habba U.S. attorney for New Jersey in March. But after the Senate did not approve her nomination within the timeframe required by law, Trump administration officials resorted to a string of maneuvers to keep her in the job — even firing her top deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace. Federal judges had appointed Grace in July, a task federal law allows them to do if the Senate fails to act.
Several criminal defendants then challenged Habba’s continued service in the post, prompting the legal battle that led to the 3rd Circuit’s decision Dec. 1. In that ruling, a three-judge panel found that the Trump administration’s moves undercut constitutional protections meant to ensure the three branches of government remain separate but equal.
Habba in her Monday statement complained about the “lawfare aimed at President Trump” since his first term and called his critics “obstructionists.”
“Do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me,” she wrote. “My fight will now stretch across the country.”
She blasted the U.S. senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, who fought her confirmation, and the federal judges who suspended most prosecutions and some other court operations until the challenge to Habba’s authority was resolved.
The U.S. Senate’s “blue slip” process allows home-state senators to block some of the president’s nominees from moving forward.
“While I was focused on delivering real results, judges in my state took advantage of a flawed blue slip tradition and became weapons for the politicized left,” Habba wrote. “For months, these judges stopped conducting trials and entering sentences, leaving violent criminals on the streets. They joined New Jersey senators, who care more about fighting President Trump than the well being of residents which they serve.”

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Senate’s Republican leader wasn’t making predictions Monday about the fate of the congressional redistricting proposal that’s become a test of loyalty to President Donald Trump.
Hundreds of anti-redistricting protesters filled the corridor outside the Senate chamber as it began taking up the bill that Republicans pushed through the House last week.
GOP Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has warned for months that not enough senators supported redrawing the maps for the issue to win approval.
When asked Monday whether he believe there were enough votes for redistricting now, Bray avoided a direct answer.
“I’ve said before that they weren’t there,” Bray told reporters. “People are having a conversation about it. Senators know there’s going to be a chance to vote on it, so we’ll see Thursday.”

The Senate Elections Committee was holding a public hearing Monday afternoon on the bill, with the committee chair saying 127 people had signed up to testify. Sen. Mike Gaskill – chair of the committee – kept testifiers to a strict, two-minute timer at the front of the chamber that ticked down 120 seconds each time someone came to the microphone to speak.
He also warned against using signs or applauding, even telling police to remove people who clap.
A committee vote was expected late Monday afternoon.
Senators are expected to meet again on Wednesday to consider possible amendments to the proposal in House Bill 1032, with a full Senate vote expected Thursday.
While the Senate held a brief floor session Monday anti-redistricting protestors can be heard from outside the chamber, chanting, “No cheaters!” over and over again, and “No redistricting!” 
Many were holding signs with sayings like, “Protect our vote!” and “Democracy doesn’t get redrawn.”
The redrawn congressional map targets Indiana’s current two Democratic U.S. House members and is designed to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm election.
Initial testimony was split on the issue — a marked difference from last week’s Indiana House hearing where 43 were against and only two in support
Mike Morris, with Lafayette Citizens in Action, told the committee “it’s time for Republicans to take a page from (Democrats’) playbook.”
He noted that U.S. Reps. André Carson and Frank Mrvan — Indiana’s two Democratic members of Congress — have supported tax hikes and twice voted to impeach President Trump.
“Senators, I urge you not to just merely be in office, but to be in power, and to use that power to save our federal republic,” he said.
John Colburn, of Sellersburg, additionally called on senators “to help fight the actions of California, Illinois, New York and others.”
As Indiana Senate begins redistricting turn, some Republicans keep mum

“If, by your inaction, a Democratic majority enters the House of Representatives in January, the result will be the beginning of two years of more accusations and investigations based upon the lies and deceit,” he said.
But Kelly Thompson, a Democratic congressional candidate in northern Indiana’s 3rd District, said she was “appalled” that the House had advanced the redistricting measure and that lawmakers “have forgotten who it is that they have been hired by, and who they are obligated to represent.”
“Instead of fighting for Hoosiers — the majority of which are against mid-cycle redistricting maps for Congress — they have chosen to cave to the pressure of the very people they have pledged to protect us from, the D.C elite,” she said.
Hoosier military veteran Lasima Packett, also opposed, called the bill “purely for political performance.”
“Today, the Senate has the opportunity to not just vote on the bill, but to lead the nation to show that in our state, we do not cave to the pressures from Washington, D.C.,” she said. “We do not redraw the democracy to suit a moment. And here, in this state, we still believe in fairness, transparency and the right for every Hoosier to be fully represented.”
The House approved the redistricting bill Friday, as expected, on a vote of 57-41. Twelve Republicans joined all Democrats present in opposition.
Indiana’s Constitution requires a majority of the 50-member Senate to approve legislation. That means the 40-member Republican supermajority must muster at least 26 votes to pass the bill if all 10 Democrats oppose. GOP Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith can break a 25-25 tie but only if there are no absences.
Sixteen Senate Republicans have publicly come out in favor of a redraw — some more enthusiastically than others — and 14 are against. The remaining 10 Republican senators haven’t taken a public stance.
Gov. Mike Braun has stood by threats that he and Trump have made to support Republican primary challengers against recalcitrant senators — and to keep up the pressure campaign if the Senate were to reject the new maps next week.

(Getty Images)A state judge has given Yazzie/Martinez plaintiffs extra time to file objections to a court-ordered Public Education Department plan to better serve public school students.
The plaintiffs in the long-running education equity lawsuit had until Dec. 1 to respond to the plan, delivered by PED about a month ago. But they argued in a motion filed last week they needed more time to finish reviewing it with experts and then draft their objections. PED Secretary Mariana Padilla told lawmakers two weeks ago the plan has “changed drastically” from an earlier draft.
Based on the plaintiffs’ ongoing review, the plan is “thoroughly inadequate” and violates previous court orders, the motion reads, and they intend to file “substantial” objections.

This story originally published on New Mexico In Depth.

The plaintiffs requested a Jan. 30 deadline. PED asked that it instead be pushed to Feb. 19 — the last day of the legislative session — which State District Court Judge Matthew Wilson granted. The department will have 30 days after that to respond, then the plaintiffs will have another 30 days to reply.
New Mexico legislators express concerns about judiciary’s role in education policymaking 

This spring, Wilson agreed with the plaintiffs that PED hadn’t complied with a 2018 court ruling that found New Mexico had violated its constitutional duty to provide a sufficient education to all children, particularly Native American and low-income students, English language learners and students with disabilities.
Wilson ordered PED to craft a comprehensive remedial action plan.
After public meetings and a statewide survey, the department delivered a 70-page draft in October. Indigenous education experts said it had major gaps, including limited concrete goals and funding estimates.
PED’s final version, submitted in early November, more than doubled, to 190 pages. According to a department press release, it adds “clearer outcomes and accountability measures,” among other improvements.
But advocates, educators and the plaintiffs say the revised plan is still short on details and wouldn’t adequately overhaul the public education system.
“We are deeply, deeply disappointed with this document,” Alisa Diehl, a member of the Yazzie legal team, said during a community event in Bernalillo last month. “We are at a critical crossroads … where the state has been given ample opportunity to do what it needs to do.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/studentsinclassroom-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 14:57:24.534038

(Reader submitted photo)  State documents show a contractor has recovered dozens of oil-covered and injured animals after the Smitty’s Supply Inc. environmental disaster in Tangipahoa Parish. Several others were found dead on site or later died from their injuries. 
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality released a report Thursday showing the most recent count for the wildlife known to have been impacted by the Aug. 22 fire, explosion and massive chemical and petroleum products spill. 
Lindsey Reeves, a spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity, called the report “deeply troubling” though said she’s not surprised at the impact on wildlife given the massive volume of the oil spill, which polluted the surrounding environment with an estimated 12 million gallons of oily and liquid chemical waste.
The report, dated Dec. 3, details a state contractor’s work recovering 74 live wild animals, including 59 listed as “oiled” and 15 others — mostly opossums and raccoons — that were captured and relocated to unaffected areas. A total of eight animals were listed as dead.

The contractor, Wildlife Response Services LLC, sent a team of five workers to Tangipahoa Parish on Oct. 11 with a few off-road vehicles and a trailer outfitted with equipment to scrub down oiled wildlife. The WRS team established a temporary rehabilitation center where animals have been bathed, fed and monitored until they’re well enough to be released back into the wild. Some have been sent to veterinary clinics for more advanced treatment. The location of the rehab center hasn’t been disclosed.  
The company reported 29 animals have been rehabilitated and released as of Dec. 3. Separate records from the Department of Environmental Quality note some animals were released at the Joyce Wildlife Management Area, a state-owned swamp just north of Pass Manchac.
Most of the oiled animals recovered have been reptiles, including 50 turtles and three alligators. Also listed as oiled were four birds and two amphiumas, which are large, aquatic salamanders often mistaken for eels or snakes. 
Among the birds were large species that typically nest near water: a Canada goose, a great egret, an osprey and a pied-billed grebe. The grebe later died, but the goose and egret recovered and were released. The report doesn’t mention the status of the osprey.
One bobcat is listed in the report, though it doesn’t specify whether it was injured or just relocated. A separate LDEQ document noted it as a bobcat kitten but offered no more details.   
Four eastern river cooter turtles also died after being secured. Two of the turtles died while in care, and the other two were euthanized at LSU Small Animal Hospital in Baton Rouge, according to the report. 
The WRS team also found an alligator, a mouse and a raccoon already dead in the area impacted by the Smitty’s Supply disaster. The report indicates the contractors collected and disposed of the carcasses.

When reached by phone Friday, Wildlife Response Services owner Rhonda Murgatroyd said she wasn’t allowed to discuss her work without permission from the Department of Environmental Quality or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. When asked about that policy Friday afternoon, LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said she would look into the matter. 
Reeves, with the Center for Biological Diversity, said there are likely many more affected animals the company wasn’t able to find. 
“After the spill, the Tangipahoa River looked like motor oil, so I suspect that the impacts to wildlife, especially aquatic species, are probably more significant and will be longer term than we see in this report,” Reeves said.
While reptiles, birds and mammals have been found injured or dead, no fish kills in the Tangipahoa River have been reported in connection with the disaster, LDEQ spokesman Greg Langley said. Much of the river, which runs directly adjacent to the Smitty’s Supply plant, was closed to the public for over two months. 
Animals of particular concern in the contractor’s report include the alligator snapping turtles, a threatened species that has been proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act, Reeves said. The team recovered 12 alligator snapping turtles, one of which required more advanced veterinary care from LSU Small Animal Hospital, according to the report.
Other imperiled species that live within the footprint of the spill but haven’t been reported as affected by the disaster are manatees and freshwater mussels, Reeves said. 
“One of the things that’s been keeping me up at night is there are manatees in the Tangipahoa River,” she said. “There’s actually a lot of protected species that live in the Tangipahoa. It’s really a special place.”
Wild animals have borne the brunt of the oil spill, but pets and livestock have also been impacted, according to several Tangipahoa residents. 
A cattle farmer, Ronnie Polezcek, who lives 3 miles from Smitty’s Supply said fallout from the disaster contaminated hay he planned to feed his herd. He also reported the delivery of a stillborn calf immediately after the explosion, according to his lawsuit against the company.
Candy Cardwell, who lives near the Smitty’s Supply facility and saw her house covered in soot and oily residue during the fire, said in an email Friday that her dog, Rusty, is still suffering from bouts of illness since the fire. A veterinarian couldn’t give her a definitive diagnosis or attribute the symptoms to certain environmental toxins, she added. 
“At one point, I thought I was going to lose him,” Cardwell said. 
Cardwell said she’s not surprised by the amount of wildlife injured in the disaster because the animals that once frequented her garden have mostly disappeared. 
“I can tell you, I don’t have frogs, lizards or rabbits anymore,” she said. “I’ve only seen one squirrel. Things like that for a good ecosystem are gone.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Attorney General’s Office settled a lawsuit with CVS Caremark over allegations the company was under reimbursing Oklahoma pharmacies.
While CVS Caremark did not admit to wrongdoing, the company will pay over $5 million to Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office and agreed to certain reforms to avoid further litigation, according to the settlement first publicized Monday. 
Reforms include reviewing pharmacy payment disputes against national cost benchmarks, responding to disputes within 10 days and working with the Attorney General’s Office to resolve additional complaints, according to a news release. 
CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, that works to negotiate prices between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. CVS Caremark operates under the parent company CVS Health.
“CVS Caremark cooperated fully to reach this settlement,” said Phillip Blando, a spokesperson for CVS Caremark, in a statement. “We are pleased to continue serving Oklahoma clients and their members to make prescription drugs more affordable.” 
Drummond’s office said 75% of settlement will repay Oklahoma pharmacies for more than 68,000 under reimbursed prescriptions filled between January 2024 and August 2025, according to a news release. The Attorney General’s Office will notify eligible pharmacies.
“When your local pharmacy is paid pennies on the dollar, or even loses money filling your prescription, it can’t keep its doors open,” Drummond said in a statement. “This settlement puts millions of dollars back into Oklahoma pharmacies so they can continue serving their communities. We’re protecting your access to the prescriptions you need and the pharmacists you trust, especially in small towns where the local pharmacy is often the only option for health care.” 
The last quarter of the settlement will support the Attorney General Office’s “continued oversight of PBMs.”
The settlement also covered the state’s investigation costs. 
Drummond filed the lawsuit in January and had sought the censure, suspension or revocation of CVS Caremark’s licenses and an assessment of fines.

The State of Iowa is contesting an injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by the former operator of the state-owned Honey Creek Resort in southern Iowa.
The lawsuit, filed last month in Polk County District Court by Achieva Enterprises, alleges state officials have misled the public into believing the company acted negligently and withdrew from the financially troubled Honey Creek Resort.
Achieva, which was hired by the state several years ago to operate and revitalize the resort at Rathbun Lake, is suing the Iowa Department of Administrative Services and Iowa Department of Natural Resources for the “abrupt and unlawful termination” of its concessionaire agreement with the state.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the lawsuit, DAS terminated its contract with Achieva without notice and in direct violation of the contract’s terms. “DAS then took extreme and disruptive actions, including shutting down the resort, firing over 50 employees, evicting guests, confiscating personal property, and making public statements that damaged Achieva’s reputation and business relationships,” Achieva alleges in its lawsuit.
The DNR, as the legal owner of Honey Creek Resort, “actively participated in the termination and transition process,” the lawsuit claims, adding that the two state agencies’ actions have “caused irreparable damage to Achieva’s business, reputation, and property interests” and now “threatens the continued viability of Honey Creek Resort as a public asset.”
Last month, a judge approved portions of Achieva’s request for an “interim temporary injunction” in the case, pending a hearing on the matter. The injunction temporarily bars the state from either reopening the Honey Creek Resort to the public or hiring a new third-party operator to manage the resort while the lawsuit moves forward in court.
The Iowa attorney general’s office has declined to comment on Achieva’s allegations, but has filed a brief with the court arguing an injunction will unduly burden operations at the resort and be against the public interest.
The state says it terminated the contract with Achieva because the company failed to live up its contractual obligations “for significant lengths of time.”
In its brief to the court, the state also notes that the contract specifically allowed DAS to immediately terminate the two parties’ relationship, without any advance notice to Achieva, in the event that the company ended or suspended its business.  According to the state, Achieva’s president, Beth Henderson, “directly indicated to DAS that (the company) would do exactly that on October 21, 2025.”
In addition, the state claims, Achieva failed to comply with the contract’s requirements to obtain and maintain insurance, exposing the state to increased liability, and also failed to provide periodic reports of its financial and operational activities.
The state further alleges that an injunction forcing the state to further pause its efforts to hire a new resort operator will result in further damage to “the resort’s operations and viability as an ongoing venue for Iowans to enjoy the state’s natural beauty.”
A court hearing on the temporary-injunction issue was held Nov. 24, 2025, but the two parties did not have time to present their closing arguments before the hearing concluded. A second hearing for that purpose is scheduled for Dec. 17, 2025.
Achieva alleges a ‘smear’ campaign by the state
The $60 million Honey Creek Resort opened to the public in 2008, offering a 106-room lodge, 28 cabins, an indoor waterpark, an 18-hole golf course and a marina. The resort struggled financially, and in 2013, the Iowa Legislature authorized a $33 million bailout to pay off the resort’s outstanding bonds.
In 2016, the DNR entered into a management contract with Delaware North Companies, a private hospitality firm. Under that agreement, Delaware North was to pay the state a portion of profits generated by the resort once annual revenue exceeded $7 million.
Over the next five years, annual revenues never reached the $7 million threshold, and in early 2022, Delaware North exercised an option to terminate its contract with the state. Achieva was then hired by the state to run Honey Creek. In its lawsuit, the company claims it “inherited a resort in disrepair — physically, financially, and reputationally.”
According to the lawsuit, the resort generated significant sales tax revenue for Iowa but operated on “razor-thin” profit margins. In late 2024, Achieva and DAS entered into a contractual amendment to provide the company with some temporary financial relief as the company worked to improve its operating margins.
That amendment temporarily waived Achieva’s obligation to deposit 5% of its gross monthly receipts into a state-created fund, enabling Achieva to use that money for operating expenses such as audits and insurance premiums.
In April 2025, following DAS’ failed attempt to give the resort to Appanoose County, DAS “abruptly ceased communication with Achieva,” the lawsuit alleges.
On Oct. 29, 2025, without warning, DAS sent a contract-termination letter to Achieva and then “took extreme and punitive actions” — shutting down the resort, barricading its entrances, and sending home “over 50 employees without notice, destroying livelihoods,” all while falsely claiming Achieva had abandoned the property, the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit claims that DAS then launched “a coordinated publicity and outreach campaign to smear Achieva,” issuing press releases and social media posts falsely portraying “Achieva as negligent and unfit” to run the resort.
The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and seeks a judgment declaring that various items Achieva purchased with its own funds — buildings, equipment, vehicles, and taxidermy — should remain with Achieva.

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) at a campaign event for JD Vance in Shelby Twp. on Aug. 7, 2024. | Lucy ValeskiSeveral key Republicans and other Michigan politicos have for months speculated if U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township was serious about his bid for governor in 2026, but a new campaign announcement shows he’s staffing up and getting ready for a strong primary fight in the upcoming August nomination contest.
James on Monday announced a reorganization of his campaign team, which now features a stalwart Michigan GOP operative in Tori Sachs, filling the role of senior advisor, as well as other national Republican faces.
The candidate, who is pushing his chips toward a gubernatorial bid instead of seeking reelection to Congress against the better wishes of the party and President Donald Trump, said the moves put him in a better position to win the August 2026 primary and the general election, should he become the nominee.
Trump jokes that GOP won’t let James seek Michigan governorship without a good replacement

“I’m excited to have assembled such a talented team who all share the same grit, passion for service, and love for our state and country as I do,” James said in a news release. “Their valuable experience of winning tough races in Michigan and nationally will help propel our winning message of bringing prosperity and sanity back to Michigan.”
Among the moves that will get the most attention in Lansing is the elevation of Sachs to the role of senior advisor.
Sachs is the current vice president of P2 Public Affairs and has worked over the past two decades as a Republican operative, issues advocacy and communications professional – with government and campaign experience to boot. She also served as the executive director for the Michigan Freedom Fund, managed James’ failed U.S. Senate campaign against outgoing U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield), and had a hand in other successful campaigns for governor.
Prior to the announcement, Sachs had been positioned as a strong supporter of James and was reportedly already doing work for James’ campaign.
Sachs made no formal announcement of the move on X but her feed is rife with James campaign related content.
James also announced that his longtime communications official, Hannah Osantowske, was moving from his congressional office to serve as his full-time campaign communications director. Osantowske served on his 2024 congressional reelection campaign. She was previously the press secretary for the Michigan Republican Party.
Other major moves affected the following James staffers:

Jackson Gross joined the campaign as its manager after previously serving as James’ congressional chief of staff;
Chris Grant will serve as an advisor. Grant is the founder of Big Dog Strategies, a national Republican firm that The New Yorker noted was behind the rise of George Santos.
Greg Brock will serve as his campaign policy advisor. He was previously a senior advisor, executive director and CEO of American Federation for Children, as well as the executive director of the Great Lakes Education Project, and the Michigan Republican Party.
Charlie Spies will serve as the campaign’s legal counsel. He currently leads the political law practice at the Dickinson Wright firm and has been involved in various GOP legal battles over the past decade.

You wouldn’t want to argue with John L.,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/08/mississippis-biggest-sports-event-ever/,"We could argue for days which is bigger: an NCAA championships playoff football game, the biggest women’s golf tournament in the world or the last bare-knuckles championship fight.","The longest bare-knuckle prizefight in history took place between John L. Sullivan and Jake Kilrain in an obscure location in south Mississippi.

Ole Miss will play host to Tulane in a first round college football playoffs game on Dec. 20 and some pundits already proclaim it the biggest, most important sports event to ever take place on Mississippi soil.
It’s huge, no doubt, and millions around the globe will watch on TV. The stakes are enormous. Win that one – and Ole Miss is a heavy favorite to do just that – and the Rebels then will play Georgia in the second round, which this year is the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Eve. Ole Miss would not be favored in that one, but the Rebels led Georgia midway through the fourth quarter on Oct. 18 at Athens. An upset could happen. Win that one and Ole Miss will be two victories away from a national championship – the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.
Rick Cleveland
But we are getting far, far ahead of ourselves. Let’s get back to the original case in point: Will the Tulane-Ole Miss playoff game indeed be the biggest, most important sporting event in Mississippi history?
That’s a good question. We don’t have any real bowl games in the Magnolia State. The Egg Bowl, which got its unofficial name for just that reason, is pretty much our biggest sports event of the year, every year. We don’t have much in the way of professional sports. The NCAA never holds any of its championships in Mississippi.
Twenty-six years ago, the late, great George Bryan brought golf’s U.S. Women’s Open – the most important tournament in women’s golf – to West Point. I still can’t believe Bryan pulled it off, but he did. Hall of Famer Juli Inkster won it and more than 120,000 fans attended. Millions more around the world watched on TV. 
That was huge – probably the most important sports event of the past century in Mississippi.
But there was one bigger still, although there is nobody alive who would remember it. John L. Sullivan, were he alive, would surely argue that the biggest sports event in Mississippi history took place on July 8, 1889. Trust me, you would not want to argue with John L.
On a brutally hot summer day in Richburg, a tiny community just south of Hattiesburg, Sullivan fought Jake Kilrain for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Adding to its historical importance, the fight was the last world championship bare-knuckle fight. Sullivan – the son of Irish immigrants famously known as “The Boston Strongboy” – punished Kilrain, a New Yorker, for 75 rounds before knocking him out.
The fight was the lead story in the next day’s New York Times. The story began: “Never, during even a Presidential election, has there been so much excitement as there is now, even when the brutal exhibition is over and it is known that John L. Sullivan was successful and that 75 rounds were necessary to knock out Jake Kilrain.”
Clearly, this is some serious Mississippi history here, and here’s the deal: The fight was not supposed to take place in Mississippi. No, bare-knuckle fighting had been outlawed in all 38 states at the time. The fight was supposed to have taken place in New Orleans, but Louisiana’s governor threatened to call in the state militia to prevent the fight from taking place. Enter one C.W. Rich, a wealthy lumberman and namesake of Richburg, who owned 30,000 acres and a large sawmill. Rich invited the entire fight party to his land, and they came by the thousands on trains.
Historical marker honoring where John L. Sullivan defeated Jake Kilrain for the heavyweight boxing championship.
We could argue for days which is bigger: an NCAA championships playoff football game, the biggest women’s golf tournament in the world or the last bare-knuckles championship fight. Better to call it a draw, which is what Kilrain offered to do after 44 rounds when Sullivan, who was knocking back whiskey between rounds, began vomiting. Sullivan declined the offer and promptly knocked Kilrain down with a blow to the ribs to end the 45th round.
So let’s not argue. Better to relive as best we can what happened more than 136 years ago in an otherwise sleepy south Mississippi community. Some snippets:

Mississippi Gov. Robert Lowry dispatched 25 armed men to the state line to stop the trains from crossing the state line. The trains plowed through, and no shots were fired. The county sheriff also tried to stop the fight at the site. But Bat Masterson, the legendary western gunfighter, gambler and sometimes lawman, not only refereed the fight but brandished his own firearms to dissuade the local lawman.
Bleachers, hastily constructed from Rich’s freshly cut pine, provided the seating for more than 3,000 spectators. The heat, which reportedly reached 106 degrees, caused resin to seep from the pine and more than a few spectators reportedly lost the backsides of their clothing to the sap. It was so hot that spectators paid the then-exorbitant cost of 25 cents for a ladle of water.
The fight was a perfect illustration of why bare-knuckle fighting had been banned. By the 34th round, both fighters were drenched in blood and sweat. Kilrain’s nose was broken, his lips split, and one eye was swollen shut. Sullivan’s fists suffered the consequences and reportedly were swollen to twice their normal size. He had a black eye and bled from one of his ears.
During the 75th round, a doctor told Kilrain’s cornermen their fighter would likely die if the fight continued. When Kilrain stumbled out to the center of the ring for the 76th round, they threw in the bloody sponge, signaling the end to the last world championship bare-knuckle fight. Sullivan was carried away on the shoulders of his adoring fans, while Kilrain reportedly wept like a child. Both were later arrested, but penalties were minimal.

We shall see what fate awaits the Tulane Green Wave and the Ole Miss Rebels on Dec. 20. There are likely to be some tears, but hopefully no arrests.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/08122009/SullIvan-Kilrain.jpg,,,2025-12-08 14:57:24.534038

Josh Stein speaks to reporters in Raleigh on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein on Friday renewed his push for FEMA to approve North Carolina’s applications for a property buyout program – applications that have been pending for almost a year.
In a letter to FEMA’s new acting administrator Karen Evans, Stein requested that the agency fast-track additional aid to households, local governments and nonprofits in the mountains that continue to wait on crucial payments.
That includes the Hazard Grant Mitigation Program, a FEMA initiative that allows the agency to buy out badly damaged properties. North Carolina has submitted more than 500 applications totaling $240 million for that program since February, but FEMA officials have yet to approve or make final decisions on any of them.
“Further delay of these approvals keeps communities and families in limbo, in some cases paying expenses on homes they cannot live in while they await word from FEMA,” Stein wrote to Evans.
Stein also asked the agency to expedite other pending aid. Requests for more than $1 billion in total public assistance dollars for North Carolina remain pending within the agency, according to the governor. State officials have repeatedly pointed to increased bureaucratic obstacles, including personal approval by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on payments from FEMA to the state.
“The reimbursement process is particularly onerous for local governments, many of which are struggling to fund essential services like trash pickup and law enforcement,” Stein wrote.
City and county governments in western North Carolina have faced significant budget shortfalls in recent months — a combination of decreased revenue over the past year and payments for Helene recovery that have yet to be reimbursed by the federal government.
FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Evans began leading FEMA at the beginning of December, the latest in a series of interim leaders at an agency whose fate is uncertain under the Trump administration but which remains crucial to North Carolina’s Helene recovery.
Her predecessor, David Richardson, resigned last month after he failed to appear or speak publicly after flooding in Central Texas. Cameron Hamilton, who led the agency before Richardson, was fired in May after he told Congress that he believed the agency should remain in place.
State officials leading Helene operations have touted the speed of the recovery, particularly with regard to their home repair and rebuilding program. But they have repeatedly pointed to federal bureaucracy as a key sticking point, failing to reimburse the state and local governments in a timely manner more than a year after Helene hit the mountains.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3910-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 14:57:24.534038

Spencer Cox on Sunday called the Utah Legislature into a special session set for Tuesday evening to consider a slate of bills meant to “facilitate” Republican state leaders’ appeal fighting the state’s court-ordered redistricting process and its resulting congressional map that created a Democratic-leaning district. 
“I support the state’s appeal and have confidence the Utah Supreme Court will consider it in a timely way so we have clarity for the 2026 election,” Cox said in a post on X late Sunday.

The governor also included on the special session agenda legislation to repeal a controversial law prohibiting public workers’ unions — including those that represent firefighters, school teachers, police officers and other government workers — from collective bargaining. 
“I support the repeal, and appreciate the Legislature’s work to refocus this conversation to ensure government is doing its best to support our first responders, educators, and all those who serve our state,” the governor said. 
The House and Senate are scheduled to convene for the special session at 6 p.m. Tuesday. 
Ahead of the session, anti-gerrymandering groups supportive of 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s redistricting ruling and pro-public labor union groups are expected to rally together at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City.
Redistricting
Last month, Utah’s Republican legislative leaders held a news conference to announce their plans to appeal Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map to the Utah Supreme Court, calling it the “most gerrymandered map in the history of the state of Utah.” 
They also announced they would be holding a special session to consider extending congressional candidate filing deadlines in order to allow more time for the possibility of a different congressional map to be enacted before the 2026 elections. 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

“Utahns deserve a stable, transparent and accountable process for redistricting, one that respects the roles of our elected branches and the voice of the people,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a prepared statement. 
They pointed to a recent poll by The Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank, that suggests a majority of Utah voters think elected officials should be making redistricting decisions, not judges. 
“The Legislature is taking action to restore order, ensure transparency and defend the integrity of our elections, keeping Utah’s constitutional framework strong and stable,” Schultz and Adams said.
During Tuesday’s special session, lawmakers plan to consider the following, according to a news release issued by Adams and Schultz’s offices: 

Election Amendments, a bill sponsored by Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, and Rep. Karen Petersen, R-Clinton. The bill “adjusts congressional filing deadlines to provide candidates clarity and election officials time to prepare,” pushing the congressional candidate filing period back by about two months, to March 9-13. The bill also “preserves existing processes for all other candidates not impacted by the court ruling, with no changes to primaries or conventions.” For congressional candidates gathering signatures to qualify for the ballot, the bill will set a window of time to file a notice of intent to gather signatures from Jan. 2 to March 13, with signature thresholds staying the same. 
Court Procedure Resolution & Supreme Court Jurisdiction, a bill sponsored by Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Provo, and Rep. Jefferson Burton, R-Salem. The bill is expected to make changes to court rules related to appeals by government officers or government entities regarding election, voting and redistricting cases, according to the governor’s call. It will propose delaying attorney fee determinations in election cases until after the appeal process has concluded and exempting a government official or entity from posting bond to appeal a case. It will also make clear that the Utah Supreme Court has “exclusive and original appellate jurisdiction over election and redistricting cases,” according to the House and Senate news release. 

Joint Resolution Regarding Constitutional Authority, a resolution sponsored by House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise, and Senate Majority Whip Chris Wilson, R-Logan, to affirm that the “Legislature, who is elected by and accountable to Utahns, has constitutional responsibility over redistricting.” It’s also expected to condemn “the courts’ novel interpretations of the Utah Constitution that infringe on that authority and silences Utahns’ voices.” 

In a ruling last month, Gibson overwhelmingly sided with the plaintiffs in a redistricting lawsuit against the Utah Legislature, blocking the GOP-controlled Legislature’s preferred map from being used in the 2026 elections and instead approving one of the plaintiffs’ submitted alternatives, known as Map 1. 
The Legislature’s map, she wrote, “fails in many ways to comply with Proposition 4,” a 2018 voter-approved law establishing an independent redistricting process and neutral map-drawing criteria. 
Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process and its resulting new, court-ordered congressional map was the result of an earlier ruling issued this summer, when Gibson voided Utah’s last congressional map that the Utah Legislature set in 2021. 
In that decision, the judge ruled the 2021 map was the result of an unconstitutional process after she determined the Utah Legislature overstepped its constitutional authority when it undid Proposition 4. In that ruling, Gibson restored Proposition 4 as law while ordering a “remedial” redistricting process to choose a new congressional map in time for the 2026 election. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Fighting the courts every step of the way, the Utah’s Republican legislative leaders have accused Gibson of violating the Utah Constitution when she picked a map that wasn’t adopted by the Utah Legislature, which GOP lawmakers continue to argue — despite multiple court rulings against them in the state’s yearslong redistricting court battle — has the sole authority to redistrict. 
Plaintiffs in the state’s redistricting lawsuit have pointed to court proceedings in other states and  argued the courts have a duty to intervene and select “remedial” maps when they determine lawmakers have failed to follow the law. But Republican lawmakers contend the judge should have gone another route, like asking the Legislature to vote on an alternative, rather than picking a map and sidelining the Legislature. 
The plaintiffs and anti-gerrymandering groups have argued that Republican lawmakers have long gerrymandered Utah’s congressional maps in the GOP’s favor, and they celebrated Gibson’s map selection as one that most closely follows Proposition 4’s neutral map-drawing criteria and reflects the state’s “political geography” with a district that best represents its urban core in Salt Lake County. 
But the map’s critics argue it created four uncompetitive districts that lead to skewed partisan results in a state that’s dominated by a statewide majority of Republican voters.
The plaintiffs’ selected map was generated by a computer algorithm designed to comply with Proposition 4, which first and foremost calls for minimization of city and county splits. 
Public union law repeal
The repeal of the anti-public union law, HB267, comes after a coalition of labor unions submitted 320,000 signatures in support of a referendum to ask Utah voters to overturn the law in the 2026 general election. The groups far exceeded the signature threshold needed to qualify the referendum for the ballot — and in May the law was put on hold until voters could decide its fate. 
With enough signatures confirmed, controversial union law put on hold

But rather than waiting for the repeal of HB267 to go to a vote, the Utah Legislature will be taking matters into its own hands. 
In a lengthy statement posted on X late Sunday, the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, said the ideas originally behind the law — meant to “end exclusive, behind-closed-doors collective bargaining that shut out many workers” and to bring “accountability” to pay raises and personnel policies — “remain just as important today as they were when the bill passed.” 
“However, it’s clear that the debate surrounding HB267 has been overshadowed by misinformation and unnecessary division,” Teuscher wrote. “That was never the intent. Repealing the bill now allows us to step back, lower the temperature, and create space for a clearer and more constructive conversation.” 
The labor groups coalition Protect Utah Workers fought vehemently against HB267, arguing it would effectively gut the power of public labor unions by collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate a contract or terms of employment. 
In a statement issued Sunday night the Protect Utah Workers coalition thanked legislative leaders for “respecting the will of the people.”

“This anticipated repeal preserves the rights of firefighters, police, nurses, public educators, transportation workers, airport staff, and all other critical public workers who improve the lives of Utahns every day,” the coalition said. 
Protect Utah Workers organizers also credited the repeal to people who got involved in the referendum effort. 
“The expected repeal belongs to the Utahns who stood up and signed the referendum,” the coalition said. “More than 320,000 people who signed the petition sent a clear message that public workers deserve a voice on the job.”
Teuscher, however, indicated that he won’t be abandoning his legislative efforts around public unions. 
“Moving forward, I appreciate the willingness of Protect Utah Workers to engage in good faith, and I intend to work closely with union leaders, public employees, and Utahns across the state in the coming year to determine the best path forward,” he said. “My focus is on developing policies that protects public workers, supports taxpayers, and keeps Utah’s public employment practices open, responsible, and grounded in good governance.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111025_Salt-Lake-City_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

In an opinion issued Monday, Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel said she was denying a request for a preliminary injunction from the plaintiffs in Holistic Research Group Inc./Michigan Cannabis Industry v. Michigan Department of Treasury.
The consolidated lawsuits posited that the new tax, passed in October as part of a comprehensive 2025-26 budget deal to raise new revenue for road repairs and rebuilds through 2030, was unconstitutional because it violated the title-object clause of the state’s Constitution.
Patel on Monday, after hearing oral arguments in the matter in November, said the industry advocates didn’t make a supported argument that a real constitutional issue existed, nor did the group succinctly show that the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act, which legalized the use and sale of cannabis in Michigan, was the only statutory mechanism to enact taxes on pot.
Critics warn Michigan’s 24% pot tax could crush small retailers, boost black market, hurt patients

“The (road funding act) is consistent with the (maraijuana taxation act). The plaintiffs contend that the phrase ‘all other taxes’ … refers only to generally applicable taxes, like the 6% sales tax imposed on all retail sales. If that were true, however, the initiative could have simply said that. Instead, the initiative stated plainly that the 10% retail excise tax was in addition to ‘all other taxes.’ And the phrase ‘all other’ is broad and expansive. According to the plain meaning of these terms, ‘all other taxes’ broadly means all taxes other than the tax imposed by (the marijuana taxation act).”
Patel further noted that the Legislature did not directly amend any of the existing taxes in the regulatory act or replace it with the new tax in the road funding legislation; rather, the Legislature imposed a new separate tax, which is permitted under the regulatory act.
“The two statutes can be read together,” Patel wrote.

The claim regarding the mechanism by which a new tax could be enacted was therefore dismissed, Patel wrote.
Patel did, however, allow the case to move forward to determine if the tax interferes with the intent of the voter-initiated law that allowed marijuana consumption, regulations and sales. Patel said a genuine issue of fact remained on that issue, which required further consideration before the court.
“The court must consider the intentions of the (taxation act) drafters and the impact of the new wholesale excise tax on the purposes of the (taxation act),” Patel wrote. “The court may not resolve such factual questions at the summary disposition phase. Discovery will be required to develop the evidence needed to support the parties’ positions in this regard.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/marijuana-700x467-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

It’s one of the first times Fitch has publicly acknowledged there may be better ways for Mississippi to manage the money it’s won in the national opioid lawsuits, cases that charged some of the country’s biggest companies with contributing to a public health crisis that’s killed over 10,000 Mississippians since 2000. 
The Attorney General’s office sent an email addressed to Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Speaker of the House Jason White late Friday afternoon with two attachments: a finalized list of applications seeking to spend some of the state’s opioid settlement money, and a letter authored by Fitch to the Legislature.
The list, a reflection of the council’s work soliciting and scoring project applications looking to address Mississippi’s addiction crisis, tiers the 127 applications into five categories. The council recommended about $40 million of grant funding in the highest priority category and about $41 million for applications in the second highest group. 
Fitch’s letter summarizes the recommendation list and adds additional messages the council agreed to tell the Legislature. Toward the end of it, she acknowledges that she and the other members may need additional help to make sure funds are spent appropriately. 
“As we prepare for the second round of applications, the Council will be reviewing its process and may determine the need to utilize services to assist in evaluation of applications, tracking of public funds, and others to ensure that the Legislature’s priorities for accountability, transparency, and public involvement are fulfilled,” she wrote.
The Legislature created the council last spring to recommend how lawmakers should spend most of Mississippi’s opioid settlement money and appointed Fitch’s office to lead the effort. Lawmakers gave council members about five months to create application materials, review completed proposals and assess how well they believe applicant organizations will address the addiction epidemic.

The council completed these tasks in that time period, but the process was filled with a variety of issues that concerned overdose prevention advocates both on and outside of the council. From missing application materials in the summer to conflicts of interests and grading discrepancies in the fall, Mississippi Today reported on challenges that led overdose prevention advocates to worry whether the funds would help those who struggle with addiction. 
In the past, Fitch has often responded to the newsroom asking questions about these concerns without proposals to address them. When Mississippi Today asked her about the council conflicts of interest in November, her Chief of Staff Michelle Williams wrote back that the members are state leaders at addressing addiction and are positioned well to address the public health crisis. 
Her idea in the letter to seek out additional services echoes fellow council member James Moore’s message at a meeting last week. Just before the members left, he asked the committee to consider reaching out to groups with expertise in helping states manage opioid settlement funds in the future.

Also in the letter, Fitch said the state has just over $90 million in opioid settlement money that must be spent to address addiction. There’s an additional roughly $15 million in state coffers that her office and the Legislature allow lawmakers to spend the same as any public money.
The setup for those $15 million mirrors the one Fitch created for the settlement money sent to Misississippi’s cities and counties. Elected leaders can spend the money on addressing addiction but don’t have to. A September Mississippi Today investigation found that most of the settlement money local governments were spending went to general expenses rather than addressing addiction — a big reason why the state has spent less money to fight the public health crisis than any other state in the country. 

Each year since 2022, Mississippi has been paid tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars, money that is supposed to help respond to the overdose public health crisis. But 15% of those dollars — the money controlled by the state’s towns, cities and counties — is unrestricted and being spent with almost no public knowledge. Mississippi Today spent the summer finding out how almost every local government receiving money has been managing the money over the past three years.Read The Series

When Mississippi Today has asked Fitch why she allowed Mississippi to spend large chunks of the settlement funds for purposes other than addiction, her office has said the lawsuits allow for some of the money to repay past government expenses fighting the opioid epidemic.

T[...]","Dr. Evelyn Griffin, a Baton Rouge obstetrician and gynecologist, was announced Monday, Dec. 8, 2025, as Louisiana's next surgeon general. She is an appointee of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to a vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Diseason Control and Prevention. (Screen capture of CDC video stream)  Louisiana’s next surgeon general is a Baton Rouge physician who U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. chose for a panel that’s implementing his anti-vaccine policy recommendations. 
Dr. Evelyn Griffin, a Baton Rouge obstetrician and gynecologist, has also aligned herself with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s stances on the COVID-19 vaccine and abortion.
The governor’s office announced Griffin’s appointment Monday. She will replace Dr. Ralph Abraham, the state’s first surgeon general who Kennedy recently picked for the No. 2 post with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Dr. Evelyn Griffin embodies the expertise and commitment that the people of Louisiana deserve in a Surgeon General,” Landry said in a statement. “Her clinical experience, her leadership in advancing maternal health, and her dedication to strengthening the doctor-patient relationship make her the exact right choice for this role. With Dr. Griffin stepping in, I’m confident Louisiana is in good hands and headed toward a healthier, stronger future,”.
In late September, Kennedy picked Griffin for the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, making her one of his replacements after he removed all 17 prior members in June. Its new lineup voted Friday to update decades-old guidelines that called for newborns to be vaccinated for hepatitis B at birth. 
Griffin sided with the majority in the 8-3 vote, which will be up to acting CDC director Jim O’Neill to adopt. Its revised policy calls for the vaccine at birth only for children whose mothers test positive for the disease. Otherwise, the first dose is recommended to be delayed until the child is two months old.
During debate over the matter, Griffin made a connection between hepatitis levels in the U.S. and immigration.
“We have had years of illegal immigration, undocumented people coming in from higher endemicity countries,” she said. 
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, a physician with a specialty in hepatology, criticized the panel’s decision in a social media post and urged O’Neil not to accept the panel’s recommendation.
“As a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B for decades, this change to the vaccine schedule is a mistake,” Cassidy wrote on X. “The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. The birth dose is a recommendation, NOT a mandate.”
“This will make America sicker,” added Cassidy, who chairs the U.S. Senate health committee and cast the deciding vote earlier this year to approve President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kennedy as health secretary. 
In the same meeting where she voted on hepatitis B vaccine policy revisions, Griffin made a presentation to committee members on the use of aluminum in vaccines as an adjuvant, which is intended to improve their efficacy. Aluminum-based adjuvants are commonly used in childhood immunizations for hepatitis B, the human papilloma virus and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP).  
Kennedy has claimed aluminum in vaccines is linked to autism and food allergies, though multiple studies have disputed that claim and shown no harmful accumulation or harmful effects from aluminum adjuvants. They include research published in July that studied more than 1.2 million children in Denmark from 1997-2018.  
Griffin said her presentation was intended to inform members of the advisory committee ahead of the possible formation of a workgroup focused on adjuvants that could make recommendations about their use in vaccines.

The December meeting was Griffin’s second as a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. At her first meeting in September, she voted with the majority on a resolution to recommend ending the use of a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox given to children before age 4. Instead, the committee suggests doctors administer the MMR and chicken pox vaccines separately. The vote followed a presentation of research that showed a slightly increased chance of fever-related seizures in children who received the four-component vaccine compared with those who received two separate shots.
Griffin previously weighed in on vaccine policy at the state level after former Gov. John Bel Edwards issued an executive order in 2021 that required students 16 and older to provide proof of the COVID-19 vaccine in order to attend school. Landry, who was attorney general at the time, joined anti-vaccine forces to have the order repealed, even though families were allowed to claim exemptions to the rule. 
At an April 2022 legislative hearing on a resolution to repeal Edwards’ order, Griffin told lawmakers “the average kid in Louisiana has a higher chance of getting struck by lightning than dying of COVID,” a claim that vaccine proponents called into question.
In her introductory speech as a new member of the CDC advisory committee in September, Griffin said she had received the COVID-19 vaccine.
“In my clinical practice in obstetrics, I had been part of initiatives for maternal immunization, including diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus,” Griffin said. “And in my overall practice, I feel like, if I was to be given a label, I would call myself pro-informed consent because of medical ethics for discussing risk, benefits and alternatives with the patient.”
Abraham offered a similar informed consent explanation when justifying his decision to forego state health department campaigns to promote and administer the flu vaccine. 
Griffin has also made public statements in support of Louisiana’s abortion ban, considered one of the nation’s strictest, that went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 
In May 2023, Griffin appeared before the Louisiana House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice to oppose a bill that would have removed a 15-year prison term and reduced a $200,000 fine for medical professionals who performed abortions. Some doctors expressed concern the state’s abortion law would result in them facing criminal charges if a colleague did not agree when a pregnancy is medically futile, a requirement to allow an emergency abortion to be performed. The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Aimee Freeman, D-New Orleans, would have allowed a single doctor to decide when an emergency abortion is warranted.     
“Our current law is not penalizing doctors who are administering standard medical care, only those who are intentionally performing abortion,” Griffin told lawmakers, who shelved the Freeman bill without taking a vote. 
Griffin has also collaborated with Louisiana Right to Life, appearing in one of its social media broadcasts to explain the post-Roe landscape for reproductive health care providers. She also joined a dozen other Louisiana doctors in signing a statement “to provide clarity that Louisiana Pro-Life Laws protect physicians’ ability to care for their patients.” The letter addresses what it calls “misinformation” and “false narratives” that have circulated since Roe v. Wade was overturned.   
“Together, let’s ensure the public knows that women’s necessary healthcare is not at stake and move forward with protecting unborn babies and their mothers,” the statement reads.
This is a developing story.

(Courtesy NMED)Two New Mexico agencies announced they have taken early steps to remediate four long-abandoned, potentially dangerous uranium mines, marking the state’s first foray into a problem experts have said is of potentially “infinite” scope and cost.
The four mines all lie in McKinley County in the Ambrosia Lake Mining District. Contractors have conducted on-site surveys, environmental sampling and other preliminary steps at the sites, according to a joint news release Friday from the New Mexico Environment Department and state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.
“This is the first step in a truly monumental effort to reverse the legacy of neglect,” said Miori Harms, the uranium mine reclamation coordinator at NMED, in a statement. 
The four abandoned mines are among an estimated 1,100 that dot the landscape in New Mexico, including about 500 on or near the Navajo Nation, following decades of unregulated uranium mining that left toxic pollutants on land and water. The lack of regulation and ephemeral nature of many of the mines means that, in most cases, state officials cannot determine which companies built the mines and are therefore liable for cleanup. 
A problem of ‘infinite scope and cost’

In 2022, the Legislature passed the Uranium Mine Cleanup Act, which mobilized state agencies to document and make a plan to remediate the mines. Then in the 2025 session, the Legislature agreed to put $20 million toward uranium mine cleanup. 
With the help of $12 million of that funding, state officials identified the McKinley County mines and found contractors who will clean them up. The mines are known as the “Schmitt Decline Mine,” “Moe No. 4,” “Red Bluff No. 1” and “Roundy Shaft and Manol Strip,” according to NMED.
NMED officials have said they will use $2 million of the one-time Legislature funding to try to find more owners of legacy mines, as well as $6 million next spring to truck out contaminated soil from two sites companies polluted with petroleum.
The agencies’ work at the four McKinley County sites will provide a template for future cleanups and funding needs, with more sites added to the remediation list next spring, according to NMED. 
While anti-nuclear advocates and state officials have long said the federal government should be responsible for paying for the mess, state lawmakers described the $20 million funding as a way to get started, at least.
State financial analysts have calculated that remediating all the mines would cost, at least, hundreds of millions of dollars, and a University of New Mexico study in 2020 said the cost and scope is potentially “infinite,” given the depth of the contamination that has spread unchecked for decades. 
One contractor that is tackling early site cleanup, EA Engineering, Science, and Technology, Inc., released a video outlining its initial steps for the Schmitt Mine cleanup. Drone video the company shot shows a deep hole in the ground with no signage, along with a long-abandoned vehicle nearby covered in rust. 
New Mexico starting cleanup for abandoned uranium mines, but officials say more funding needed

Leona Morgan, a longtime Diné anti-nuclear activist, told Source New Mexico on Monday that she appreciates the state using its own funding to start remediation, even though it represents a fraction of the estimated cost to clean up the mines statewide. 
“It’s just scratching the surface, literally,” she said. “I know it’s just preliminary, like, these first actions will inform future actions. So my concern is getting more money, especially from the federal government, securing the funds needed for all of the orphaned mines.”
But she also urged state contractors to conduct adequate preliminary — including culturally-sensitive — community outreach, and she hopes that the state avoids repeating the mistakes of the past by ceasing to monitor mines after they’ve remediated them. A changing climate makes constant vigilance necessary, she said. 
“We can never consider these sites 100% remediated and, you know, pat ourselves on the back, like, ‘Oh, job well done,’ and walk away,” she said. “These are permanent liability sites.”
The state’s announcement said it will produce quarterly progress reports, including one it released Monday. 
The report says officials selected the four mines due to a variety of factors, including ease of access, proximity to homes and the hazard they pose. But the NMED is still working on a ranking which sites are the highest priorities, noting that it hasn’t yet completed assessments for all neglected sites and that “prioritization work” is underway under a separate contract. 
The agency also pointed the public to its dashboard, which contains a map and database with the history, location and remediation progress on statewide abandoned uranium mines. 
“We are making meaningful efforts to protect communities,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in the statement. “This initiative is about taking concrete steps to finally address the unfinished business of abandoned uranium mine cleanup.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-08-at-11.14.16-AM-1024x597.png,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

Bird, a Westminster Democrat, will step down on Jan. 5 ahead of the 2026 legislative session, meaning a vacancy committee will convene to find her replacement. She represents House District 29, which includes northern parts of Jefferson County and Adams County bordering Broomfield.
“With the upcoming legislative session beginning on January 14, the people of House District 29 deserve a representative who will be fully focused on legislative matters — and the voters of the Eighth Congressional District deserve a candidate who is able to put in the 70+ hours a week of work that it will take to flip this seat from red to blue,” Bird said in a statement.
Evans, a Republican, unseated former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who was the first person to represent the district. Caraveo in September dropped her bid to reclaim the congressional seat. Colorado state Rep. Manny Rutinel, a Commerce City Democrat, is also running for the seat, as well as Colorado Treasurer Dave Young and Marine veteran Evan Munsing. The Democratic primary election in June will determine which candidate will face Evans in November.
Before announcing her congressional bid, Bird served on the Colorado Legislature’s powerful Joint Budget Committee, which drafts the annual state budget. She was first elected to the Legislature in 2018 after a stint on the Westminster City Council.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After meeting in closed session for over 90 minutes Monday, the Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board opted to delay a vote on how it will respond to groping allegations against State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst.
The Executive Board, which is in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, met at least once on Oct. 27 to discuss the same situation in another closed session, said State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who chairs the group. They met a second time Monday but adjourned without reaching a resolution.
The Nebraska State Patrol cited McKeon for misdemeanor public indecency in late October after investigating an allegation by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party this spring in Lincoln. The Patrol received a report in early September that McKeon allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas said at the time.

During the Executive Board’s Oct. 27 meeting, Hansen said the group agreed to move McKeon’s former first-floor office, exchanging it with another first floor office previously occupied by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. He did not specify why the board felt the move was necessary.
Hansen said the board had a “great discussion” about the situation Monday, but he ultimately felt it would be best to hold off on any formal decisions until the full board was able to attend. Three voting members of the 10-member board were absent Monday — State Sens. John Arch, John Fredrickson and Mike Jacobson. Fredrickson was absent due to a canceled flight, Hansen said, while Arch and Jacobson notified him that they wouldn’t be able to attend in advance.
“I want to make sure we’re all together if we make any kind of decision of this magnitude,” Hansen said.
Hansen said he’s targeting Saturday for the board’s next meeting, that being the earliest date that all members can participate.
Typically, legislative committees are not allowed to vote in private sessions, but Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler said some “administrative” exceptions might apply to the Executive Board. This would apply to McKeon’s office move, which was voted on in closed session.
The Executive Board is obligated to take action in response to allegations of workplace harassment within 45 days of the initial report’s filing, per the Legislature’s workplace harassment policy. Hansen said the board fulfilled its obligations in the actions it took Oct. 27.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.

Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign.
McKeon has made several statements about the incident since the citation was issued, including a July 28 letter he sent to the staffer, and a broader statement through his attorney Perry Pirsch. In those statements, McKeon acknowledged the incident occurred but denied the woman’s allegations, describing the incident as a “light-hearted exchange” that he argued did not qualify as public indecency.

Pirsch said McKeon “made a single remark — a joke — to a staff member about her planned trip and hoping she and her husband would receive a ‘Hawaiian lei,’ or words to that effect, and he then patted her on the back.”
“It was meant in jest, and nothing about his action was in any way sexually charged or lewd, just a bad pun,” Pirsch said in the statement.
State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, a member of the Executive Board, previously told the Examiner that board members were advised by legal counsel to be cautious in their public statements about the situation.
This is because they don’t want to inadvertently do something that could impede the Patrol’s investigation, Dorn said. However, Hansen said Monday that the ongoing criminal investigation is not influencing the board’s actions.
McKeon is expected in Lancaster County Court Dec. 10, authorities said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-08 18:01:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi congressional delegation pushes back on new E.U. forestry regulations,Katherine Lin,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/08/mississippi-forestry-congressional-delegation-eu-regulations/,The delegation says E.U. rules aimed at combatting global deforestation are an infringement on American property rights.,"In a rare show of bipartisan cooperation, Mississippi’s congressional delegation has sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer with concerns that new regulations implemented by the European Union will harm the state’s forestry industry. 
The delegation wrote that the E.U. regulations “introduce substantial uncertainty” for the forestry industry and “risks further depressing already strained log and wood-product markets, harming rural communities that depend on healthy, functioning timber economies.”
While the delegation’s letter primarily focused on the state’s $15-billion a year forestry industry, the regulations apply to other agricultural products, such as cattle and soybeans. 
In 2023, the E.U. revised its timber supply chain regulations to curb deforestation, clearing trees and converting forest land to another use, such as agriculture. The new regulations, which will start to be implemented on Dec. 30, require companies importing wood and certain agricultural products to certify that their products were not produced on recently deforested land.
The delegation said this is an infringement on “American private property rights.”
Casey Anderson, executive director of the Mississippi Forestry Association says that as a consequence of the new regulations, some producers are being asked to sign contracts by traders saying that they will not convert the land. Landowners are pushing back at their ability to decide how best to use the land they own.
“The E.U. is trying to dictate how we do things in the U.S.,” said Anderson. 
In a social media post, Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson wrote, “We can never allow foreign interests and globalists to dictate the use of our land and natural resources here in Mississippi.”
Anderson points out that most producers in the U.S. practice sustainable forestry. And in the delegation’s letter, they highlighted that the E.U. considers the U.S. to have “negligible or insignificant levels of deforestation.” 
Mississippi and much of the South’s forestry industry has struggled in recent decades and is facing low prices. 
“It can really do a lot of harm if it goes through,” said Anderson of the new regulations.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06172847/20211014_carbon_trees.jpg,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

One lesson in particular stayed with me: “Make eye contact and small talk.” In simple terms: talk to your neighbors. Seek face-to-face connection. Humanize one another.
In 2024, I ran and won my race for State Representative by knocking on more doors than anyone else in the state —and it worked. And amid the polarization in our state, our nation, and our world, Snyder’s advice feels urgently relevant.

Nick Menapace

Although I was not on the ballot in 2025, I spent months holding a listening tour across my district. Those conversations reinforced a truth that rarely appears in our social media feeds: people, when they speak in person, are far more thoughtful, reasonable, and compassionate than online discourse suggests.
Online, disagreement quickly hardens into hostility. Algorithms reward anger over understanding. People retreat into echo chambers that tell them not only what to think, but whom to fear. And increasingly, we’ve learned that some of the people fueling this anger and misinformation are being paid to do so— or are not who they claim to be. In that environment, it becomes easy to blame one another instead of asking what solutions might actually help our communities.
It’s tempting to dismiss the most aggressive online voices as “keyboard warriors,” but I’ve found that most people express hostility out of fear, not malice. Rapid economic shifts, rising costs, global instability, and local uncertainty leave many feeling unmoored. Fear convinces them that someone —usually someone different from them— is the cause of their anxiety. Fear convinces them that empathy is weakness. And fear convinces them that other people’s suffering is inevitable, or even deserved.
But when you sit across from someone at their kitchen table or at a town hall, that fear softens. People ask honest questions. They listen. They share their worries about their families, their jobs, and their bills. They want practical solutions, not partisan talking points. And more often than not, they want the same basic things: stability, safety, opportunity, and a government that works.
I was recognized for bipartisan work in Hartford this last session. That mattered to me because it reflects a principle I hold deeply: government works best when we approach one another as partners in problem-solving, not opponents in a culture war. But political incentives —especially online— too often reward division over governance.
That dynamic is dangerous because the challenges facing Connecticut are real and complex. They require sustained focus, long-term planning, and cooperation. They cannot be solved through outrage or one-minute video clips.
Consider our statewide priorities:
Energy affordability. Connecticut families pay some of the highest energy costs in the country. The most reliable way to bring those costs down is to expand the use of the lowest-cost, most proven sources: solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear power. Other states and nations are moving rapidly in this direction. We should, too.
Healthcare access and cost. Expanding Husky to all Connecticut residents would reduce overall system costs and ensure every resident can access care without financial risk.
Taxes. If we want to lower the sales tax and reduce income taxes for everyday people, we need to modernize our fiscal guardrails and build a long-term plan that reflects how people actually live and work. That requires serious bipartisan engagement.
Housing and property taxes. The most effective way to stabilize property taxes is to expand the municipal tax base. That means building smart, fiscally sound housing that allows young people, families, and seniors to stay in Connecticut. This is the conclusion reached by municipal leaders, economists, and national experts. Our recent housing bill is a start —but only a start.
Transportation. Reducing congestion and long-term infrastructure costs requires greater investment in public transit, walkable town centers, and bikeable infrastructure. These investments are not ideological —they are economic development tools.
None of these solutions are radical. All are grounded in research and successful models nationwide. The question is not whether solutions exist; it is whether we can build the trust and civic culture necessary to implement them.
Which brings me back to Snyder’s lesson. Algorithms, headlines, or viral posts do not sustain democracy. It is sustained by people looking each other in the eye and choosing cooperation over contempt.
If Connecticut is to flourish in the decades ahead, we must recommit to the simplest democratic act: talking to one another. More listening, less shouting. More shared responsibility, less shared resentment. We can solve the challenges before us —but only if we face them together.
The future of our democracy begins with a conversation. So let’s have it.

Wray, who served 10 terms in the House, lost a close primary race to Democratic incumbent Rep. Rodney Pierce by 34 votes last year. 
Wray was criticized by Pierce and other Democrats for siding with the Republican House majority on key votes, including veto overrides. 
Wray posted his appeal to Republicans on his campaign Facebook page on Monday morning.

“Are you a Republican and want to support me in the primary election against Rodney Pierce?” the post reads.
“You can temporarily change your party affiliation to UNAFFILIATED, but you must do so BEFORE FEBRUARY 6TH. If you make the switch, remember that on election day, you must ask for a Democratic ballot in order to vote for Michael,” the post says. 
As he announced his plans for a rematch, Wray leaned into his work with Republicans, saying it helped him secure money for the district. 
“I am not going to apologize for working in the back rooms of the State Legislature to make sure that our region gets money from the state budget,” Wray said in a July statement. 
The district includes Warren, Halifax and Northampton counties. It is heavily Democratic, so the primary winner will likely win the seat. 
Pierce faced no general election opponent last year. 
Pierce said in a fundraising email last month that district residents haven’t benefited from the successes Wray claims. 
Wray’s appeal to Republicans is not surprising, Pierce said in a statement Monday.

Ned Lamont’s administration projects, because of stagnant fuel and sales tax revenues.
But business leaders and a key legislator insist Connecticut has other options to maintain expanded financing for highway, bridge and rail upgrades, including scaling back one of the governor’s favorite programs: an aggressive effort to pay down pension debt.
And while Lamont downplayed the revenue challenges last week, saying the impact wouldn’t be felt for several more years, his budget staff projected borrowing levels to be reduced starting in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
Just 12 months after the Lamont administration reported that Connecticut was ready to increase a key element of its transportation construction budget by 40%, from $1 billion to $1.4 billion, by 2028, a new forecast held that three-quarters of that planned growth is unaffordable under the current system.
That $400 million in new borrowing anticipated for the 2026-27 and 2027-28 fiscal years should be stalled, according to recommendations in the Fiscal Accountability Report issued Nov. 20 by the Office of Policy and Management, Lamont’s chief budget and planning agency. 
Reversing plans to invest hundreds of millions in infrastructure work will have a chilling effect on industry hiring plans, said Donald Shubert, president of the Connecticut Construction Industry Association.
“The minute they see any kind of uncertainty, or the minute they get any clue things are slowing down, they pull back,” Shubert told the Connecticut Mirror. “We pull back and that slows the economic activity or the economic benefits — immediately.”
The Connecticut Business and Industry Association’s vice president for public policy, Chris Davis, said that “any business that’s on the fence” about hiring or otherwise expanding, “they need that [state funding] stability to make those types of investments.”
Twelve months ago, in the 2024-25 fiscal year, while Connecticut was borrowing $1 billion for its transportation rebuild, Lamont’s budget staff said that should grow to $1.3 billion in 2025-26, $1.4 billion in 2026-27, and then remain at that level through at least 2029 – a prediction that excited industry and construction trade leaders.
Now the administration wants to stick with $1.3 billion in borrowing for 2025-26, but drop to $1.2 billion in 2026-27, $1.1 billion in 2027-28, and remain there through 2030. And given inflation in the construction industry, $1.1 billion in the late 2020s would reflect little increase, if any, beyond the $1 billion Connecticut borrowed last fiscal year.
Borrowing through bond sales, coupled with matching federal grants, are the two ways Connecticut pays for the overwhelming bulk of its transportation construction projects.
Slowing revenue growth is a solvable problem
So why does Lamont now expect to forego most of that funding growth he envisioned just one year ago?
The administration points to the $2.3 billion Special Transportation Fund, which represents 8% of the overall state budget, and covers the principal and interest payments on infrastructure projects, as well as operating expenses for the Transportation and Motor Vehicles departments.
Twelve months ago, Lamont’s budget office expected annual tax revenues supporting the fund to grow almost 4.5%, or $84 million, by 2028. Now they say those sources — two fuel levies, a portion of sales tax receipts, and a highway mileage fee on most large trucks — will effectively remain flat, growing by less than $6 million over the next three years.
The administration projects this sluggish revenue growth, coupled with rising costs, will push the STF into insolvency by 2029. But this is common outcome when projecting a state program’s finances out four or five years into the future, at which point inflation normally outpaces revenue growth.
Still, learning $84 million in expected extra tax receipts by 2028 largely won’t happen is problematic.
Tens of millions of extra dollars for annual debt service payments would allow for hundreds of millions of dollars in additional yearly borrowing for construction work. That’s because the state pays off various projects across 15 or 20 years.
But compensating for losing roughly $80 million in expected revenue growth also is far from unsolvable.
And some of the first solutions that might come to mind are untenable or unnecessary.
Lamont would not need the electronic highway tolls he sought in 2019 and 2020, nor the $600 million they would generate annually, far more than needed to fill an $80 million gap.
And given that both the governor’s office and all legislators are up for reelection next November, any hike in fuel or sales taxes — which would raise far less than tolls but still enough to cover the gap — also is likely off the table.
But there are still more options.
Will Lamont ease budget controls to grow construction work?
The overall state budget’s General Fund, which covers about 90% of all operating expenses, has been sharing some of its resources with the transportation fund since the late 1990s. The last major change occurred in 2015 when legislators and then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy assigned about 1/13th of annual sales tax receipts, which currently exceed $5.2 billion — to the STF.
And the General Fund has generated unprecedented surpluses, averaging more than $1.8 billion or 8% to 9% of the fund, since 2017, thanks to aggressive budget caps installed at that time that force big savings.
Most of those unspent dollars, about $10 billion in total since 2020, have been used to reduce the massive pension debt Connecticut amassed across seven decades prior to 2011. And that’s in addition to the more than $3 billion in mandatory pension contributions Connecticut makes annually.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has been reluctant to scale back that savings effort, though, given Connecticut still owes more than $33 billion in this area. His critics, including many of his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly, say this effort is too aggressive and is draining funds from education, health care, municipal aid and other core programs.
They also note the governor has proposed saving less, himself, on a few occasions.
He signed big state tax cuts, which take hundreds of millions annually away from surpluses, in 2022 and 2023, just before and after he successfully ran for a second four-year term. He also proposed and won legislative approval last year for a new endowment to bolster affordable child care. That last initiative took $300 million from last year’s General Fund surplus and is expected to collect tens or hundreds of millions from future surpluses indefinitely.
Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Transportation Committee, said Connecticut should not abandon what amounts to a huge planned investment in new construction jobs and in the state’s economy.
“If we really do something like that, we’re not looking at the big picture,” she said, adding that by rebuilding the state’s aging highways, bridges and rail lines, “we create a vibrant economic picture for our state.”
Cohen also praised Connecticut’s savings habits in recent years and said the state should continue to whittle down its pension debt.
But “I also recognize times change,” she added, “and sometimes minor adjustments are needed.”
Shubert’s association has asserted for years that Connecticut should be borrowing more than $1.5 billion annually to rebuild a transportation network that is one of the nation’s oldest.
According to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, Connecticut ranks 35th in the nation, 1st being the worst, in terms of the share of its highway bridges considered “structurally deficient.” But when it comes to the percentage of bridge area that falls into this category, Connecticut ranks in the worst 15 states, according to the association.
Being “structurally deficient” doesn’t mean the bridge is functionally obsolete but at least one key component, such as a deck or culverts, is rated in “poor” or worse condition. And though not necessarily unsafe, the bridge requires significant repair or monitoring.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, declined to say what changes the governor might recommend when he proposes his next budget to the General Assembly on Feb. 4 but added “We expect considerable discussion around this [transportation] question in the coming months.”
Lamont has pressed lawmakers in recent years to consider cutbacks to public transit programs, including higher rail and bus fares to reduce the need for state subsidies. This also could help offset sluggish revenue growth and make more borrowing for transportation construction possible.
But Cohen was skeptical the Democratic-controlled General Assembly would look to tighten belts further in this area.
“I certainly hope not,” she said. “I want to see more people on public transportation and that means putting investments there.”
Governor downplays transportation funding challenges
The governor downplayed the transportation funding challenges when discussing them with reporters last week.
Federal transportation funding has been on the rise since 2021, when President Joe Biden and Congress enacted an aggressive $1.2 trillion transportation infrastructure program, Lamont said, adding that “2030 is a long way away. A lot can change.”
But President Donald Trump already rolled back some of that infrastructure funding in July when he signed an omnibus federal spending and tax measure.
Trump also has told states he intends to link future federal transportation funding, “to the maximum extent permitted by law,”  to local compliance with federal policies on vaccines and immigration enforcement — issues on which many Connecticut officials and the president disagree.
State Department of Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto said the transportation fund revenues and changes at the federal level do present challenges to Connecticut’s construction program.
But the department also has adjusted its capital program to ease demand for more state investments “without compromising the long-term health of our transportation system. [The department] will also continue seeking competitive federal grant opportunities.”
The DOT has more than 650 active infrastructure projects, Eucalitto said, adding “We will continue to invest strategically in aging infrastructure … directing funds where they deliver the greatest benefit to Connecticut residents, communities and businesses.”
Keith R. Brothers, president of the Connecticut Building Trades Council, said that since Lamont took office in 2019, a robust 90% of his organization’s members in transportation construction-related trades have been employed.
“I have all the confidence in the world,” Brothers added, “that Gov. Lamont is going to keep us working.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoldStarBridge_090417a013-e1470924753243.jpg,,,2025-12-08 12:58:50.744504

For families who have already checked off the bigger city parades, Greenwood offers something a little different.
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | December 2025
If your family is still looking for a classic small-town Christmas parade to round out the season, Greenwood has you covered. The annual Greenwood Christmas Parade returns Friday, December 12, with a charming Santa’s Workshop theme that captures everything people love about a hometown holiday celebration and a winter night out.
The parade steps off at 7 p.m. in the heart of Greenwood, giving families time to grab an early dinner, bundle up, and stake out a good viewing spot before the first lights roll by. Organizers encourage spectators to arrive early to enjoy the festive atmosphere and avoid last-minute parking scrambles. Greenwood is expecting visitors from across Sussex County, which adds to the lively energy along the parade route.
A big part of the fun this year happens even before the parade begins. From 4 to 6 p.m. families can stop by for photos with Santa. It is a great chance for little ones to share wish lists while parents snap keepsake pictures. This early window also gives people a chance to support local businesses, warm up with a hot drink, and ease into the evening instead of rushing in at the last minute. Parade volunteers are planning simple activities for children and encouraging residents to show their holiday spirit by dressing in bright red, green, and cozy sweaters.
As the sky gets dark Greenwood will start to glow. The Santa’s Workshop theme invites floats, marching groups, and community organizations to think in terms of toy trains, elves, peppermint stripes, candy canes, and twinkling lights. Residents can expect a mix of decorated vehicles, school and church groups, first responders, scout troops, and small businesses all doing their part to bring the North Pole to Sussex County for one night. Many participants spend weeks preparing their floats which leads to friendly competition and extra creativity.
The parade also doubles as a community fundraiser. Town organizers have highlighted gift baskets and raffle prizes tied to the event, with proceeds helping to underwrite parade expenses and future celebrations. Local businesses have stepped up to donate items and sponsorships to keep the tradition strong year after year. Proceeds will support community activities throughout the coming year.
For families who have already checked off the bigger city parades, Greenwood offers something a little different. It is intimate, easy to navigate, and full of familiar faces yet still big enough to feel special. Kids get their Santa moment, parents get that warm small town feeling, and the entire community gets a reason to gather, wave, and wish each other a merry Christmas.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_Greenwood-Parade.jpg,,,2025-12-08 12:58:50.744504

(Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)A sales agreement approved Monday by Santee Cooper would eventually remove $2.7 billion worth of debt from customers’ power bills as part of a major nuclear restart in the Palmetto State.
More than eight years after abandoning the project, the state-owned utility’s governing board unanimously passed an agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding, with New York investment firm Brookfield Asset Management for the purchase of two partially built nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.
Santee Cooper and Brookfield must still go through feasibility and other due diligence studies. A date for the $2.7 billion payment is unknown.
It depends on Brookfield finalizing its investment decision. An estimated date won’t be set until June.
Under the agreement, Santee Cooper will maintain an ownership interest in the reactors of up to 25%. This would give customers access to the power the reactors would produce if completed.
Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.
The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a single megawatt.
Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, which customers so far continue to pay for on their monthly bills.
“Our customers have been paying for this,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said. “It’s time they got some value for it.”

Shkreli announced Monday morning her intentions to seek the Michigan Democratic Party nomination for the executive office that oversees elections, vehicle registrations and other important state business.
“My parents came to this country to flee authoritarianism,” Shkreli wrote on social media. “Now as those same threats take root here at home, I’m ready to defend our democracy, protect our Constitution, and safeguard Michiganders’ right to vote.”
A campaign launch video highlights Shkreli’s career as the Michigan Lottery commissioner and as a Macomb County assistant prosecutor, while also gearing up for an ice hockey match.

Shkreli enters an already crowded primary on the Democratic side of the race to replace current Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who cannot seek reelection due to term limits and is the frontrunner in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary hunt. Michigan Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum and former state Sen. Adam Hollier of Detroit are also seeking the party’s nomination. Secretary of state candidates are nominated by the respective parties during their spring conventions.
Tim Smith is the sole Republican running on the GOP side of the primary race.
The announcement was followed swiftly by a message from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appointing Shkreli’s successor: Joe Froelich.
“The Michigan Lottery helps us make record investments every year into our schools, and their success is supported by a team of professionals who ensure our games are run smoothly,” Whitmer said in a statement. “I’m proud to announce Joe Froehlich as acting commissioner of the Michigan Lottery, ensuring a seamless transition as Suzanna Shkreli resigns effective today. The incredible team at the Michigan Lottery will continue working together to run our games effectively and with full integrity.”
Froelich was previously the chief operating officer of the Michigan Lottery, as well as its deputy commissioner of legal affairs and charitable gaming, and the agency’s director compliance and legal affairs. He also worked in the Michigan Department of Attorney General’s office.
Whitmer also praised Shkreli as she moved on to seek a career in state politics.
“I’m grateful to Suzanna for her service to the people of Michigan as Lottery Commissioner,” Whitmer said. “She’s led the commission through multiple record-breaking years, facilitating billion-dollar investments into Michigan’s public schools.

A 33-year-old Vermonter was killed this month while serving as a medic in Ukraine, according to his parents.
Andrew David Mario, of Brattleboro, died Dec. 3 while assisting an international brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard in the Donetsk region’s Pokrovsky district, said his mother and father, Heidi and Michael Mario.
Mario is believed to be the first Green Mountain State casualty of the Russia-Ukraine war.
“He made his decision to cast his lot with the courageous citizens of that beset nation, very much aware that he was putting his life at great risk,” his parents wrote in their son’s obituary, sent to VTDigger and set for publication in local media.
The family said it learned of Mario’s death from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.
“We do not, as yet, know the details,” Heidi Mario told VTDigger.
An autopsy could take place in Kyiv as early as Monday, she said.
Mario left for the war-torn country last summer after being “overcome with an urgent desire to make a meaningful contribution” to Ukraine since a Russian invasion in 2022, his parents wrote in his obituary. 
Mario trained with the Ukrainian National Guard before becoming a medic in the village of Zolotyi Kolodiaz alongside other global volunteers.
Russia has been pummeling Mario’s service area — an eastern Ukraine railroad hub and “gateway to the war’s most fiercely contested region,” according to reporters there — for more than a year, with its former population of 60,000 residents reduced to fewer than 1,300.
Mario, born Aug. 26, 1992, attended Guilford Central School for elementary and middle school and Brattleboro Union High School for two years before completing his education through Vermont Adult Learning.
“Although struggling throughout his life with ADHD, depression and an at times tempestuous personality, Andrew was deeply compassionate, with a lively curiosity, especially concerning history and politics, a sly sense of humor and a fiery passion for social justice,” his parents wrote in his obituary.
Mario volunteered at what’s now Brattleboro’s Groundworks Collaborative shelter, supported pipeline protesters by living in a tent at North Dakota’s Standing Rock Indian Reservation, and toured the Canadian province of Ontario with a group raising awareness about missing and exploited First Nations women and girls.
Mario also worked as a bicycle messenger in Philadelphia, a carpenter in California, an organic farmhand in Finland and Serbia, and a support staffer at the McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole scientific research stations in Antarctica.
His family is planning a memorial gathering for next spring.
“We are heartbroken,” his mother said.

The review is conducted every four years with each member country of the UN. It is a critical analysis of that country’s progress in human rights. 
The United States is the only country on the planet that failed to show up and did not even submit its report that was due on August 4. 
What happened to us — to the “shining city upon a hill”?
What have we become? 
And what message does our silence on human rights send to friends and foes alike? 
The current U.S. administration has turned its back on human rights. Consider recent events: rising numbers of extra-judicial killings; unlawful deportations without due-process hearings; escalating violence against women, girls, and trans people, including outrageous numbers of murdered pregnant women; lack of equal opportunities for people of color; the wide economic chasm between the top 1% and the rest of the country; worsening access to health care, especially for poor and rural people; increasing rates of childhood mortality from preventable diseases — and much more.
Although the U.S. didn’t submit a human rights report, we at Minnesota-based World Without Genocide and allied organizations did. Civil society organizations can introduce critical issues with what’s known as a shadow report. In these reports, issues can be raised that the country under review may have omitted or presented less than fully or with bias. We organized a coalition of national nonprofit organizations and we submitted a shadow report.
In a modern-day David and Goliath story, our shadow report excoriates the United States over its human rights abuses, exposing systemic failures that undermine the rights and dignity of people across the nation. The report offers unflinching analyses and strong recommendations that would protect and uplift all who call this country home.
Our small coalition exposed the United States, an all-powerful giant of an adversary, and provided critical information to members of the Human Rights Council. 
The report focused on the human right to bodily autonomy, which encompasses health choices, protection from violence, and personal control over all stages of one’s own reproduction. As a cornerstone of gender equality and a fundamental human right, bodily autonomy is safeguarded by international treaties, national laws and global human rights mechanisms. Our coalition report demonstrated that U.S. policies have eroded these protections, striking at the very heart of rights that should be universal and inviolable.
The UN has rescheduled the U.S. review for November 2026. We hope that the United States will show up. We will show up and update our report. We are ashamed that the United States was absent – ashamed because every other nation in the world participates, and this sets a terrible precedent that threatens to diminish the process of holding human rights as a global goal. 
Furthermore, we are ashamed because the United States has tossed aside even a pretense of concern about human rights, here and everywhere.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trumpsept232025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 11:58:02.042750

Trail Finder, a free, statewide trail website supported by the Vermont Trail Accessibility Hub, is making it easier for Vermonters of all abilities to find outdoor adventures that fit their needs. With accurate information and firsthand stories, the project is helping more people experience the joy of getting outside.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Findi[...]","Enock Glidden, an accessibility consultant, visits trails in Vermont and writes about his experiences on Trail Finder’s Trail Talk page.
At Oakledge Park in Burlington, accessibility consultant Enock Glidden rolls onto the trail with measuring tools in hand. He checks the grade of the paved path, looks for tight turns near the shoreline, notes surface changes, and photographs rest areas under the cottonwoods.
Soon after, those observations appear on Trail Finder, a free-to-use website used by trail-seekers to discover diverse, four-season trails across Vermont. 
His review of Oakledge is part of a statewide effort supported by the Trail Accessibility Hub—a partnership of organizations managed by The Vermont Trails and Greenways Council working to expand access and improve accessibility information across Vermont’s trails.
Enock’s on-the-ground assessments of Vermont trails give trail-seekers something they’ve long needed: clear, consistent, objective accessibility information all in one place. 
“For many people with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities, as well as older adults or parents with young children, planning a day outside isn’t just about choosing a trail labeled ‘easy,’ ” says Steve Engle, Director of Community Geographics, one of the organizations that oversees Trail Finder.
Details like surface, grade, width, and places to rest are important objective trail descriptors. These specifics, however, are often missing from websites, signage, and trail maps, making the research harder than the trip itself.

Trail Finder’s Growing Database 
Lacking, incomplete, or outdated trail information is the first barrier that people encounter when trying to access the outdoors. Trail Finder is working to change that. 
Thanks to recent grant funding from the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation (FPR), including a $644,000 Vermont Outdoor Recreation Economic Collaborative (VOREC)  Community Grant supporting the Trail Accessibility Hub, the Trail Finder team has been able to improve the descriptions and maps for over 125 miles of accessible pedestrian trails on the site.
Routes of all types are continuously added, from rail trails to adaptive mountain biking. Website users can click the “Access(ible) Experience” search filter to find trails that offer greater levels of access. Through the Trailside Services feature, businesses can also get listed on Trail Finder, making it easier for trail users can find restaurants, nearby accommodations, gear rentals, and guide services. 
“Trail Finder’s work to develop and expand their database of accessible trails addresses a critical gap in communication about accessible outdoor recreation,” said Claire Polfus, Recreation Program Manager for the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation. “It’s about giving more people the confidence to explore Vermont’s outdoors.”
Managed and maintained by Hub partners Upper Valley Trails Alliance and Community Geographics, it’s one of the few free map-based trail databases in Vermont focused on increasing access to trails. 
“Unlike other trails apps and websites out there,” says Engle, “Trail Finder relies on 100% trail manager-approved content. Postings for accessible trails on the site receive extra attention and review from Trail Finder’s administrators to ensure consistency and accuracy.”
Hub partners are not only improving existing trail descriptions and adding new ones, but also developing resources for building accessible trails and sharing first-person stories that show what accessible outdoor recreation looks and feels like across Vermont.
Since 2024, the Hub has held over a dozen informational workshops and webinars for trail managers and completed 55 trail accessibility assessments with more than 30 organizations to evaluate pedestrian, aquatic, and adaptive mountain biking routes. These assessments are in demand and help trail managers identify the specific improvements needed to enhance access or meet established accessibility standards.
An accessibility assessment is conducted with Vermont Adaptive on a mountain biking trail to determine what upgrades need to be made to the trail.
More Voices on the Trail
Greg Durso, a wheelchair athlete and program director at the Kelly Brush Foundation, played a key role in creating a series of three tutorial videos on building adaptive mountain biking trails with Hub partner The Vermont Mountain Bike Association. 
“Adaptive mountain bikes are for people who want the thrill of trail riding,” Durso said. “The main goal of adaptive trails is to provide adaptive riders the same experience as two-wheel riders.”
New Hub resource pages built with input from trail users provide detailed information on how to build accessible pedestrian trails, mountain biking trails, and aquatic entry points, along with their benefits. 
A series of audio stories developed by the Hub helps people hear what access feels like. In one, Derek Flint, who is blind, describes kayaking with his family at Green River Reservoir in Hyde Park and how accessible launches make a difference. 
“Being on a kayak…it’s a sense of freedom. I used to be able to drive, and now I get a part of that back with kayaking,” he said.
In another, hand-cyclist and wheelchair user Edie Perkins talks about her visits to the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. 
Trail Finder also hosts a growing set of trail accessibility blog posts, including two about Edie’s trips to Raven Ridge in Charlotte and Vermont Institute of Natural Science (VINS) in Quechee, and the confidence that comes with clear, accurate information.
“Everything felt thoughtfully designed for accessibility without losing that wild, natural feel,” Perkins shared in a post she recently wrote about VINS for Trail Finder. “The paths are subtle, the views are incredible, and the experience left me grinning ear to ear…the sense of peace was exactly what I’d hoped for.”

Mike Jones of Richmond clinched the Democratic nomination Sunday evening for next month’s special election in Virginia’s Senate District 15, defeating Del. Debra Gardner, D-Chesterfield, in a firehouse primary. The spotlight now shifts to a January showdown for control of a key Virginia Senate seat.
Jones, first elected to the House in 2023, will face Republican John Thomas next month in a race Democrats view as critical to protecting their narrow 21–19 majority in the Virginia Senate. 
The solidly Democratic district, which covers parts of Richmond and northern Chesterfield County, is expected to be one of the first major tests of the party’s strength heading into the 2026 General Assembly session.
Sunday’s firehouse primary — a rapid, party-run process held under a compressed timeline after Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi resigned to prepare for her statewide post — drew steady turnout from local Democrats at three polling locations. Party leaders quickly rallied behind Jones after polls closed Sunday.
“Mike Jones has shown through his work and leadership that he is deeply committed to serving Virginians and tackling the everyday challenges families face,” Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Lamont Bagby, a state senator from Henrico, said in a statement. 
Jones, he said, “brings a steady, solutions-focused approach to public service, and he understands what it takes to make life more affordable and strengthen our communities. Keeping our Democratic majority in the Senate is critical to continuing that progress, and I look forward to serving with him in the Senate.”
Jones currently represents House District 77. If he wins the Senate seat on Jan. 6., the victory will immediately trigger another special election to fill his House seat.
Sunday’s primary followed an unusually tense week in what had been a brief nomination contest. 
As reported by Virginia Scope on Thursday, the campaigns of Gardner and Jones — once close political allies who often described each other as friends — came to blows after Gardner released a TV and digital ad focused on past allegations involving Jones and a 2024 protective-order case that was later dismissed by a judge.
The ad displayed old news headlines and asserted, “Mike Jones’ history of alleged violence toward women is shocking, dangerous and disqualifying.” 
Jones criticized the ad in an interview with the outlet, saying Gardner left out the full context of the case’s resolution. 
“I am honestly saddened that a member of my own party, someone who I thought was a friend, who I’ve talked in confidence with about this situation, would use portions of it for her political gain,” Jones said. 
Gardner’s campaign declined to answer questions from Virginia Scope about whether she was aware of the judge’s decision dissolving the protective orders.
Jones, meanwhile, spent more than $100,000 on his own advertising, running spots on Richmond-area TV and radio stations focused on “lowering costs, school funding and housing affordability.”
Top Democratic officials lined up behind both candidates in the final days of the race.
Hashmi was among the first to endorse Jones last month, calling herself “proud” to support him. Richmond Mayor Danny Avula backed Jones on Thursday.
Gardner, a former deputy county administrator, received endorsements from Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach. 
The special election was scheduled after Hashmi’s victory in the November statewide contest created a vacancy that needed to be filled before lawmakers return to Richmond in mid-January. 
Redrawn in 2021, Senate District 15 is safely Democratic but geographically split between Richmond and Chesterfield, with strong pockets of organized voter turnout. Hashmi won the seat by a decisive margin in 2023.
Thomas, the Republican nominee, is familiar to voters after challenging Gardner in House District 76 last month, a race he lost by more than 37 percentage points. 
With the nomination settled, Jones now has less than a month to focus on the general election and consolidate Democratic support.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)An influential Democratic-Farmer-Labor official in northern Minnesota has roiled the party by declining to resign as chair of Congressional District 8 despite being charged with criminal vehicular homicide.
The incident has split Democrats between those who believe due process should play out for the accused and those who believe a personal scandal will derail the goals of beleaguered Democrats in northern Minnesota.
On the evening of July 3, 2024, police in Itasca County responded to a report of a person lying in a lane of Highway 169, near Nashwauk. They found the body of 19-year-old Carter Haithcock, who was pronounced dead at the scene.
The next morning, 8th District DFL Chair Cyndy Martin called 911 and said that she may have been involved in a collision near Nashwauk the night before, according to the criminal complaint.
Martin, who declined the Reformer’s request for comment, pleaded not guilty last month to a felony count of criminal vehicular homicide. Martin faces up to 10 years in prison. Martin’s attorney, David Valentini, also declined to comment.
Martin is one of the most influential DFL figures in northern Minnesota. In addition to chairing the 8th District party, she sits on the DFL’s Constitution, Bylaws and Rules Committee. She’s also a successful fundraiser and has connections with statewide elected officials.
Minnesota Democrats have largely refrained from publicly commenting on Martin’s case and whether she should remain in party leadership. Local congressional district parties aren’t controlled by the state party, but state officials could call on or press Martin to resign.
Multiple DFL elected officials in the Northland didn’t respond or declined the Reformer’s requests for comment about Martin.
Last month, DFL Chair Richard Carlbom was asked at a Democratic listening session why someone charged with vehicular manslaughter should remain in party leadership.
Carlbom, after an awkward pause, said “there is due process in this country, and I’m not about to, like, somehow — I don’t know, people sometimes think I can just, uh, well, I’m gonna allow due process to play out.”
Carlbom echoed those comments in a statement to the Reformer.
“This was a tragic loss of life, and my condolences go out to Carter’s family and everyone affected by this heartbreaking situation. Because this is an active legal case, we’re not going to prejudge the judicial process,” Carlbom said.
But pressure could be mounting for Martin to resign. Minneapolis citizen journalist Taylor Dahlin is tracking the case closely, and some party activists want her out.
A mysterious email
Lee Cutler served as the 8th District DFL vice chair under Martin until March of this year. Cutler said he was good friends with Martin, but he felt that she should have resigned back in November 2024 when she was criminally charged.
He says that shortly after prosecutors charged Martin, he and Martin together drafted an email to the DFL’s 8th District delegates saying Martin had already resigned. The email was sent out from the local party’s email account.
“Unfortunately, our friend and leader Cyndy Martin has stepped down as chair due to personal matters,” Cutler wrote in the email sent out on Nov. 23, 2024.
In the email, Cutler directed delegates to tell reporters if they’re contacted that Martin is no longer the chair and that he’s the acting chair.
About three hours later, another email from the local DFL party’s account — purportedly written by Cutler —  told the delegates: Never mind.
“Please disregard the previous email that I recently sent out. There was a misunderstanding, and Cyndy Martin has not resigned from her position as CD 8 Chair,” the email said.
Cutler says he didn’t write the second email, even though his name is in the signature of the message. He says the second email made its way up to DFL leadership, and he suspects someone in the party sent out the second email under his name.
The details of the emails were first reported by the Duluth Monitor.
In March, Northland politics came under a microscope after former Minnesota Sen. Justin Eichorn was charged with attempted coercion and enticement of a minor. Shortly after he was arrested, Eichorn resigned from the Senate under immense pressure from his Republican colleagues.
Cutler said that Martin’s charge and Eichorn’s scandal are obviously different, but he said that as with Eichorn, Martin’s charge is a distraction.
“It’s tragic what happened. I’ve always felt that as a leader within the DFL, our role was to uplift the party, its goals and the candidates — not ourselves,” Cutler said. “Party leaders are meant to support that work in the background, so the story should never be about us. In the 8th District, we need to focus on electing a candidate who represents our party’s values and this situation only serves as a distraction from that work. Fighting within the party is never a good thing.”
Minnesota v. Martin
Martin told law enforcement in July 2024 that on the night of the collision, she attended a dinner and was driving home after her dinner concluded at about 10:30 p.m., according to court documents. While driving through Nashwauk in Itasca County, she hit something with her car, she told officers.
“She believed she struck an owl or a turkey. (Martin) stated she did not stop, and continued home,” the complaint reads.
Martin was speaking to someone on the phone at the time she allegedly hit Haithcock, according to the complaint. The police interviewed the caller, who said that Martin exclaimed “Oh my God. I hit something,” according to the complaint. The caller told Martin to call 911. Martin later called the person back and said nothing was wrong with her vehicle — something only hit her windshield.
A photo of Martin’s car taken by State Patrol troopers at her Grand Rapids home on July 4, 2024. Screenshot from court documents.
State patrol officers interviewed Martin at her Grand Rapids home the morning of the collision. Outside they found her teal Chevy Tahoe; the windshield was cracked and a headlight was  broken, and there was a piece of black fabric stuck between the hood and the frame, according to court documents.
The troopers asked Martin if she was drinking or on medications, and Martin told them she had an opioid prescription for knee pain, and she took one pill earlier in the day. Throughout the interview, the troopers said Martin exhibited mood swings and was “distraught, crying and upset at times,” according to court documents. Because of her behavior, the troopers decided to do a DWI investigation. Martin tested negative for controlled substances, including opiates.
The state and Martin’s defense agree that Haithcock was wearing dark clothing and “engaged in risky behavior” by walking in the highway, the state wrote in court documents.
Although the collision occurred in July 2024, Martin wasn’t charged with vehicular homicide until four months later. Itasca County Attorney Jacob Fauchald declined to tell the Reformer why.
Under state law, “the driver of any motor vehicle involved in a collision shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the collision, or as close to the scene as possible, and reasonably investigate what was struck.”
The prosecution argues that Martin gave conflicting information about what happened.. She told officers that she believed she hit a bird and didn’t stop, while surveillance footage from a nearby gas station showed her stopping there for about 25 seconds.
The state argues that a jury could find that Martin didn’t conduct a reasonable investigation after the collision and doubt her claim of believing she hit an animal.
“There is a stark difference between an adult male and an owl or a turkey,” the state wrote in court documents.
Martin’s defense relies on whether she conducted an adequate investigation of the collision since she believed she only hit a bird.
Haithcock was 19 at the time of his death and had a young son.
“His passion was helping people who were going through hard times. He was caring, genuine and was such a funny sweet boy who took care of everyone. Carter had a great sense of humor and could make anyone laugh and was always, ‘Just Chillin,’” his obituary reads.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MG_8862-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 10:59:10.749814

(Photo illustration by Dean Mitchell via Getty Images)Drive through any town in northern New Hampshire and you’ll see older adults everywhere — opening shops each morning, volunteering at church fairs and food banks, checking in on neighbors, or caring for grandchildren while parents are at work. Older adults are the backbone of rural New Hampshire. They preserve local traditions, sustain civic institutions, and keep the social networks of small towns functioning.
But beneath these visible strengths lies an urgent reality: Many rural older adults are struggling to access even the most basic health and social supports they need to stay healthy, safe, and connected. 
New Hampshire is now one of the oldest states in the country, with nearly 21% of residents age 65 or older. Rural counties have even higher concentrations. These communities rely on small health systems, local nonprofits, and volunteers — but these systems, especially in the North Country, are stretched to the breaking point. 
Demand is surging at the same time that Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits are being cut, insurance reimbursements do not keep pace with cost, there are workforce shortages, and service capacity lags behind. Appointments are scarce, waitlists are long, specialty care is limited, and transportation is unreliable or nonexistent.
This is not sustainable. And it will not improve unless the state begins listening to rural older adults and investing in the services they say they need most.
 Listening to the people most affected

As New Hampshire considers new funding models, federal waivers, and/or delivery-system reforms, one principle must guide every decision: Older adults must have a meaningful voice in shaping the programs designed to support them. Across the country, the most successful rural initiatives elevate local residents as partners — not passive recipients. 
New Hampshire’s rural older adults possess deep resilience, life skills and experience, and practical insight. Policymakers cannot afford to overlook their expertise. Without targeted investment, chronic illness will continue to erode the health of older adults and the stability of the rural communities that depend on them.
Chronic illness
For many rural older adults, chronic illness shapes daily life. Rates of heart disease, diabetes, COPD, arthritis, obesity, and dementia are significantly higher in rural areas nationwide. In New Hampshire, 53.9% of adults 65 and older live with four or more chronic conditions, and 44.4% of adults 75 and older report a disability. Managing these conditions requires consistent, coordinated care, yet distance, weather, limited home-care capacity, and primary-care shortages often make that impossible. Social drivers of health — including social isolation, food insecurity, and unsafe or unaffordable housing — further compound risk and escalate costs. Two approaches with especially strong evidence in rural settings that can address chronic illness are integrated primary care and community health workers.
A strong primary care system increases trust, improves outcomes, and reduces unnecessary emergency-department and inpatient use. It provides comprehensive, continuous, and coordinated care; reflects the population it serves; and connects patients to specialty care, behavioral health, and needed services.
Community health workers, or local residents trained to serve under the guidance of a primary care provider, help bridge the workforce gap, extend care into hard-to-reach areas, and support chronic-disease management. For every $1 invested, community health worker programs save an estimated $11 and reduce hospitalizations and non-emergency ER visits. This is precisely the kind of cost-effective, high-impact solution New Hampshire needs.
Prevent falls
Falls are one of the most preventable and costly threats to older adults. In 2022, New Hampshire recorded 272 fall-related deaths, 17,743 emergency-department visits, and more than $315 million in related costs. Evidence-based fall-prevention programs, home-safety assessments, physical therapy, and simple home modifications should be scaled immediately.
Support aging in place and improve chronic-care capacity
Most older adults want to remain in their homes and communities. Programs like Home and Community-Based Care and Choices for Independence help — but demand vastly exceeds workforce capacity. The state must strengthen and modernize these systems.
Additional proven models include:
PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly): Integrates medical, social, and long-term care for people 55 and older who meet nursing-home eligibility. PACE consistently reduces hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and admissions to long-term care — even for people with dementia.
Hospital at Home: Delivers hospital-level care — including IV therapy, daily clinical visits, and remote monitoring — directly in the home. Research in The New England Journal of Medicine shows it reduces complications, lowers costs, and shortens recovery time. For rural areas with limited beds and long travel distances, this model is a natural fit.
New Hampshire must also increase insurance reimbursement rates, develop housing for health care workers, expand mobile-health teams, and improve coordination between health care and community organizations. If approved, the state’s Rural Health Transformation Grant proposal could be pivotal in advancing many of these solutions.
Expand broadband infrastructure: Telehealth, mental-health visits, remote monitoring for chronic illness, virtual physical therapy, and Hospital at Home all depend on reliable broadband. Yet many rural towns still lack it. Broadband is not optional — it is core health infrastructure.
Reduce social isolation: In 2025, 25.5% of older adults in New Hampshire lived alone, with rural residents at highest risk. Loneliness increases depression, dementia, and mortality. Senior centers, library programs, congregate meals, volunteer networks, and Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers can help rebuild connection and address the mental health conditions associated with isolation and loneliness.
Ensure reliable transportation: Rural older adults face long travel distances, winter isolation, and limited public transit. Volunteer driver programs, demand-response transit, and community rideshare networks can help close these gaps.
Healthy older adults mean healthy rural communities
Investing in primary care, community health workers, fall prevention, chronic-disease management, home-based care, broadband, transportation, and social-connection programs is not simply compassionate policy — it is an economic and moral imperative. Older adults are not a financial burden. They are the heart of rural New Hampshire.
When older adults thrive, rural communities thrive. And when rural communities thrive, New Hampshire thrives.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/caregivingworkforce-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 10:59:10.749814

Gretchen Whitmer was elected unanimously as the vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association at the group’s annual meeting in Phoenix on Saturday. 
Whitmer will succeed Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in the role, as Beshear was elected as the chair of the association. 
“In Michigan, we’ve shown that staying focused on the kitchen table issues — like costs, jobs, and roads — is a winning strategy,” Whitmer said in a press release from her Fight Like Hell PAC. “We flipped counties that voted for Trump like Macomb, Bay, and Eaton because we showed up and focused on what Michiganders needed to get ahead. As Vice Chair of the DGA, I look forward to taking what we’ve learned in Michigan to races across the country and helping candidates win tough races.”
The Democratic Governors Association is a political organization focused on electing Democrats in gubernatorial elections nationwide, as well as providing support for sitting Democratic governors. 
“We’ve proven that when we show up and focus on what we can do to make people’s lives better, then we can win anywhere, even in the toughest places,” Whitmer said in a press release from the association following the election.
Whitmer’s term will include the 2026 election cycle, in which 36 gubernatorial seats are up for election — 18 currently held by Democrats, including Michigan, and 18 by Republicans. 
“We also know with all the chaos coming out of Washington, D.C., it’s never been more important to elect Democratic governors,” she added in a video posted to X. “I know the stakes are high, but I know we can meet the moment and win.”
Whitmer stepped away from the National Governors Association earlier this year over what her office said were concerns about a lack of bipartisanship in the organization. 
Other Democratic governors who left the organization, including Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Laura Kelly of Kansas, reportedly did so due to what they perceived as a lack of pushback to the policies of the Trump administration.

Source images: Katie Moore/The Marshall Project; Getty Images; Circuit Court of Cole County; and U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.When Steven Caldwell-Bey wasn’t able to get a regular refill for his blood thinners, he began taking one pill a day instead of two to stretch them out. The problem, he said, is that it’s been difficult to get medical attention at Jefferson City Correctional Center because so many nurses have quit. 
Other men serving time there said they haven’t been able to get proper care for conditions ranging from diabetes to cancer.
The issues came to a head after a group of nurses walked out in protest of the working conditions in October.
The Marshall Project – St. Louis spoke to over 40 people who have worked or lived at the prison. They reported rampant problems, including going weeks without medication, a lack of medical attention in solitary confinement and monthslong waits to get treatment or follow-up appointments for serious issues. 
Former and current staff at the prison lay the blame on Centurion Health, a private company that was awarded a contract in 2021 worth over $1 billion to provide health care for incarcerated people in Missouri. The state had sought a company to provide primary and specialty health care, medications, personnel and supplies and coordinate hospitalizations, the request for proposal said.

But staffing problems began to worsen in recent months after some personnel concerns. Employees allege that Centurion forced them to work long hours and extra shifts, creating a dangerous environment for them and their patients. 
Dana Long was a nurse in the infirmary, where sometimes she said she was caring for more than 20 patients on her own when there should have been at least an additional nurse. That meant juggling tasks such as administering IV antibiotics, taking vitals, changing wound dressings, helping those who were incontinent and, when she had time, updating medical records. 
Patients were in danger, she said. 
Long is one of several nurses who quit in early October. More have left since then. 
A corrections employee who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation said the situation has gotten to the point where it’s causing unrest because people are frustrated. Daaron Harris, who is incarcerated, said people are feeling helpless, which creates hostility among the men and toward staff.
Missouri Department of Corrections officials declined a request for an interview with Warden Kelly Morriss. Department spokeswoman Karen Pojmann acknowledged that several health care professionals left in a short period, adding that Centurion brought in staff from other prisons to fill the gaps when the departures happened. She also said there is a team that monitors medical services. 
Pojmann referred other questions about staffing to Centurion. Officials there did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
State Rep. Gregg Bush, a Democrat from Columbia with a career in nursing, said he was beyond troubled by the allegations. He said he supports a review by the Missouri Legislature of any contractor that may not be meeting expectations.
In its contract proposal, Centurion officials boasted that its “corporate leadership team invests heavily in recruiting and human resources management systems to ensure full staffing.” According to the company’s website, there were 19 vacancies in mid-November of this year. Those included openings for a director of nursing and registered nurses, as well as a medication technician and mental health staff.
Caylin Marriott, a medical scheduler who worked at the facility in 2024, said she begged Centurion officials for help. A nurse who worked there until October, who didn’t want to be named because she’s looking for a new job, said their calls for staffing support were ignored. 
Nurses would go in for a shift without knowing when they would be able to leave because the next person might not show up and there are strict rules about leaving patients unattended, she said. Others said they were fired when they refused to work extra shifts.
In a resignation letter, Marriott said there was a toxic environment and she couldn’t let her mental health suffer longer. Another nurse wrote in her resignation letter that she left because “basic medical care and human dignity were routinely compromised.”
To get medical attention, people in prison fill out a health services request form. Ariane Todd, who worked at the facility until January, said they were “months and months and months” behind on addressing the forms. Marriott said there were stacks that had not been reviewed. People in solitary confinement went even longer without medical attention because their slips didn’t get picked up there on a regular basis, she added.
The forms for those outside of solitary are collected during sick call, a designated time they can seek medical attention.
Nineteen incarcerated men who spoke to The Marshall Project – St. Louis reported problems accessing care because sick call was canceled for weeks at a time. Several incarcerated men and corrections employees at the prison pinpointed that it had been over a month since it was last held.
A Centurion employee who didn’t want to be named out of a fear of retaliation said she’s seen patients who didn’t get proper care for infections or receive their cancer medication. 
The men in prison acknowledged that medical staff were overwhelmed. Most said the nurses were well-qualified and some went out of their way to help, though a couple were unprofessional. 
Two dozen incarcerated men told The Marshall Project – St. Louis that they had a difficult time getting their medication. Joseph Wilson, 52, fears he could have an embolism because he has gone several days without his blood thinners. 
“I really go into a panic,” he said.
Wilson shared a journal entry dated Sept. 10 that read, “So I’ve been out of my Eliquis since 9/6/25. I have done all I’m supposed to on my end but they haven’t issued me my monthly dosage cards. My Leg has begun to swell again.” 
Others reported not being able to get insulin, blood pressure medication or inhalers for various breathing disorders. Several said it was a long battle to get medical items like orthopedic shoes. Two former staff members confirmed there was an issue getting medical shoes ordered for patients. 
Many of the men said they relied on their loved ones to call and put pressure on Centurion or the Missouri Department of Corrections. In a November email, Tammy Mogab pleaded for help for her brother, a detainee there who was not getting his insulin. 
“I am very aware of the critical shortage of healthcare workers at JCCC but the essential medical needs of residents continue,” Mogab wrote.
Adequate health care is a longstanding issue in many prisons, but Deandre Pointer, who has been incarcerated for over two decades, said he’s never seen it this bad. He said there have been days when he hasn’t gotten his insulin and his blood sugar has bottomed out. 
Many of the men, especially those with chronic ailments, said a lack of medical attention means they are left in physical pain. The conditions also take a mental toll. One man said he was scared his liver cancer was spreading, but he hasn’t gotten an appointment to be seen yet. Those with lengthy sentences said they worry about getting older in the prison, which houses more than 1,830 people. 
Douglas Maupin, 69, said he got sepsis when a bleeding ulcer turned into an infection. He was transferred to a local hospital for a time before returning to the infirmary.
“It’s crazy down here,” he said.  
At least 14 of the incarcerated men interviewed by The Marshall Project – St. Louis said they submitted complaints that didn’t go anywhere. Joe Becker filed grievances when his finger was injured in 2021. When those didn’t help, he filed a lawsuit in July 2023. Court records show he received at least a dozen denials. Becker is one of several men who have open lawsuits regarding medical care at Jefferson City Correctional Center. Other cases involve allegations about scabies treatment, dental care and a catheterization procedure. 
Eugene Burrell has filed five complaints in the past year or so. He has also written to the assistant warden and the Department of Justice seeking help getting orthopedic shoes, according to documents reviewed by The Marshall Project – St. Louis. In a grievance dated Oct. 24, he wrote: “JCCC Medical Dept. has canceled ‘sick call’ for several weeks this month citing ‘staff shortage.’ I’ve attended three weeks hoping to obtain health care & a follow-up appt. to no avail.” 
In another complaint, he wrote that the lack of health care access “equates to neglect on behalf of the Department.”
In February, Zachary Smith submitted a complaint saying he had not received refills for his thyroid medication. In a response five months later, a nurse wrote that she had “discovered that all items have been ordered and will be issued as soon as they arrive.”
Eugene Crider, 56, said he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neurological disorder that can be fatal, and has been in the infirmary for over a year. At first, there was an aide who helped him, he said, but she’s gone. Nurses give him medicine to help him sleep, but otherwise, he relies on prisoners who have jobs in the infirmary to help him with daily tasks such as getting dressed and eating, though there are restrictions on what they can do to help. 
Crider said he’s been “laying here, day in and day out.” He said he wanted to know if Centurion and the Department of Corrections officials were inept or just didn’t care.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Conservation groups across the West are raising concerns about Steve Pearce, a former New Mexico representative who is President Donald Trump’s newest nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management.
The nomination has reignited a fight over the management of public lands which was highlighted during negotiations over Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” due to proposed amendments to sell off federal land. The fight also spawned two new bipartisan caucuses in Congress, both co-chaired by Montanans, and predicated on public land access and management.
In Nevada, the BLM manages nearly 48 million acres of federal land, about 67% of the state. Nationwide, the BLM oversees 245 million acres of federal land, along with 700 million acres of subsurface rights for extraction and energy development, putting the position directly in the crosshairs of energy developers and outdoor industry groups.
According to the Center for Western Priorities, Pearce amassed a “lengthy anti-public lands record,” sponsoring bills to shrink national monuments and increase extraction on national forest land.
Many conservation groups are specifically honing in on Pearce’s long record of advocating to sell off federal lands, including sponsoring legislation in Congress to authorize land sales or exchanges with local governments.
In a letter to then-House Speaker John Boehner in 2012, Pearce wrote that of the federal lands located in the West, “most of it we do not even need.”
He proposed using land sales to reduce the deficit, similar to rhetoric heard earlier when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum equated federal lands to the nation’s “balance sheet.”
“We cannot afford to hand the keys to 245 million acres of our public lands over to someone who has spent his career trying to auction them off to the highest bidder,” Aubrey Bertram, staff attorney and federal policy director at Wild Montana, said. “Steve Pearce’s record is crystal clear: he believes public lands should be privatized for billionaires’ benefit, not protected for the people’s.”
But Pearce’s nomination has been greeted with enthusiasm by mining and energy companies that operate on federal land, as well as by many Republican officials, including Montana Sen. Steve Daines.
“I knew Steve in the House days, and Steve is a great pick. And I particularly like the fact that it’s a Westerner,” Daines said in an interview. “I think it’s helpful when we have leaders in those important positions that come from the West, when they understand uniquely the challenges we face as it relates to federal land, state land, private land. And Steve Pearce has lived it and breathed it.”
Daines is a member of the newly formed Senate Stewardship Caucus, which is co-chaired by Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy.
The two Montanans also bucked their party earlier this year by joining Senate Democrats in a resolution that would have prevented the use of public land sales to reduce the deficit.
Pearce has roots in the oil and gas industry that stretch beyond his political work.
In the 1980s, Pearce founded an oilfield services company in New Mexico, which he later sold when he won his first election.
Starting in 2003, he represented New Mexico in Congress for seven terms.
He lost races for the U.S. Senate in 2008 and governor in 2018.
While conservation and public land advocates have pushed back against Pearce’s nomination, industry groups have applauded Trump’s pick.
The National Cattleman’s Beef Association said Pearce’s experience makes him “thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing.”
The Western Energy Alliance, comprising oil and gas companies across nine western states, also put out a statement of support for Pearce.
“As a westerner coming from a state that’s nearly 20 percent BLM land, he understands the bureau’s mission. As a former congressman and chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, his record shows he’s been a champion of multiple-uses of public lands. Steve has been a longtime friend who understands the value of energy development among other uses,” the Alliance said.

(Image by Lela Seiler, courtesy of CCS Early Learning)The Alaska Supreme Court has ruled that the state’s child support system has first priority when a foreclosed property is sold to pay multiple debts.
The court issued its opinion on Nov. 28, resolving a long-running lawsuit brought by Global Federal Credit Union (formerly Alaska USA) against the state and several other defendants.
“This is a pretty important case from my client’s perspective,” said Jonathan Clement, a senior assistant attorney general who represented Alaska’s child support system.
“This is the first time that a court has actually decided that child support gets priority over all other judgment lien holders, even liens recorded earlier, when there’s surplus funds at issue,” he said.
The case decided by the court involved property in Eagle River that was mortgaged by Wells Fargo. In 2017, Global levied a lien against the property for unpaid debt. Shortly afterward, the state’s child support division recorded another lien against the property for unpaid debt.
Typically, liens are repaid in chronological order: First filed, first paid.
In 2018, a law firm sold the property through foreclosure and paid off the remaining Wells Fargo mortgage. There was money left over, but not enough to pay both Global and the state.
The state protested the law firm’s plans to pay Global first, and the firm complied with a state order that required it to pay the state first. 
Global sued in state court, but a district court judge and a superior court judge each ruled against the credit union before it appealed to the supreme court.
Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Jude Pate concluded, “Our interpretation of (state law) provides an effective priority for CSSD liens over competing judgment liens.”
Alaska’s Child Support Services Division (CSSD) is now known as the Child Support Enforcement Division (CSCD).
That priority doesn’t put the state above a bank holding a mortgage or “deed of trust” but it does give the state priority over other liens on the property.
 “The important thing for this case is that it gives CSCD another tool where they can try to collect money that’s owed by the obligors,” Clement said.
“I would say of all the cases I’ve worked on, this is the one that will have the most impact in my career going forward,” he said.
An attorney representing Global declined comment on behalf of the credit union. 
In a footnote attached to the case, Pate wrote that the court’s ruling could cause people to behave differently during foreclosure auctions.
He suggested that if the Legislature disagrees with the court’s interpretation, it might want to pass a law clarifying two conflicting statutes interpreted by the court.
“If our interpretation is contrary to the legislature’s intent,” he wrote, “amendments to the relevant child support statutes could clarify the interaction between child support liens, other liens, and mortgages.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/unnamed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 10:59:10.749814

(Submitted) TOPEKA — The newly formed American Honey Institute will offer the honey industry the same opportunities and advocacy that other commodities currently have, one of its founders said.
Gary LaGrange, CEO of Valor Honey, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that industry-wide challenges need to be addressed. The low price of honey makes it difficult for small producers to compete with imported honey, much of which has had cheap sweeteners added to it, he said.
“We also discovered that the industry as a whole did not have the power as other commodities have, wheat and soybeans and corn and cattle, and it was a bit more ad hoc,” LaGrange said.
Four years ago at an National American Honey Producers meeting, discussions began about creating the institute to focus on educating people about the importance of bees and the honey industry; to create a certification process for honey; to promote beekeeping as a therapeutic activity to help veterans and others; and to advocate on a national level, LaGrange said.
Through Valor Honey and its work teaching soldiers beekeeping skills as a way to help them manage post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, LaGrange has seen beekeeping transform lives. But when veterans wanted to take their skills and compete in the honey market, they couldn’t, he said.


“They could sell small quantities, but to get into the commercial, industrial side was difficult to them because the price of honey was so low, they couldn’t compete with the honey that was being put on the market by packers,” LaGrange said.
Packers buy imported honey, he said.
In 2021 and 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested 144 samples of imported honey, finding that about 10% were adulterated with sweeteners. LaGrange said more consistent testing and enforcement is needed so consumers know what they are buying.
Brian McCornack, Kansas State University professor and and head of the Department of Entomology, joined LaGrange on the podcast to talk about the honey institute, which he will lead. LaGrange said K-State offers research capabilities along with the ability to communicate through its networks to support educational outreach.
McCornack said beekeepers lose about 40% to 50% of honeybees annually, but last year, reported losses were upward of 70% to 80%.
“Those kinds of loss losses for a managed pollinator like honeybees are not sustainable,” he said. “At the center of this is really the U.S. beekeeper. They make most of their living, especially the larger producers, through pollination services. So they’re moving, literally trucking bees, around the U.S. to provide valuable services for a lot of the commodities that we find in our grocery stores and our shopping carts. When you have those kinds of losses, and one of your primary incomes is pollination services, staying alive in that industry becomes very challenging.”
The formation of an institute to combine research, education, workforce development, communication, and testing for authenticity and integrity of honey was a perfect fit for K-State, McCornack said.
“Our beekeepers are in peril as well,” he said. “It’s not just about the bees. It’s making sure that beekeepers can thrive, and making sure that they’ve got a market that is fair.”
Valor Honey and K-State are joined by the American Beekeeping Federation and the American Honey Producers as partners in the institute.
“The two largest beekeeping orgs in the U.S. coming together on this particular topic, to me, is what really keeps me inspired on a daily basis,” McCornack said. “If everybody has an important message and sings their song the loudest, and they’re not singing from the same sheet of music, as Gary often says, then it’s really hard to know what to really focus on.”
Bringing the primary organizations together to discuss the issues will help the industry create a plan and find solutions, McCornack said.
LaGrange said the honey industry has flown under the radar, often because people don’t understand the importance of pollination.
“Most people think that honey comes out of a hive or two in the backyard, and they just don’t understand the industry,” he said. “They don’t understand the importance of bees and pollination. Without them, we would be paying a whole lot more for fruits and vegetables and other commodity crops that they pollinate. Honey is really tertiary in that process.”
LaGrange, 83, spent 28 years in the Army and served three tours in Vietname. Since founding Valor Honey, he’s made it his life to support veterans and others who need help through teaching them about beekeeping. Founding the American Honey Institute is the next step in helping soldiers.

“To help these young men and women find find their way, to keep them from suicide, to get them out of this post traumatic stress syndrome, and get them out of these other issues that come with war — it’s so important to see that happen on a recurring basis with those we work with,” LaGrange said. “It’s just a wonderful thing. What good does it do if they can’t get into the industry that’s profitable, if they can’t find work that’s profitable? So it all ties together, and that’s why we intend for all of the functions of this institute to get as much as possible under one roof.”
Packers, consumers and others involved in the industry are part of the solution, he said.
McCornack said answers won’t be easy to find. There are no standards for honey currently, a process needs to be worked out for testing and even determining the definition of honey, and all of the work needs to be research-based.
“There are politics involved in the changes that need to be made,” he said. “Anytime you bring up the word ‘regulation’ or policy or law, I think that gets people nervous, and that can be expected.”
McCornack said the institute will maintain its focus on the goals of stabilizing the industry for beekeepers and for consumers, who should know what is in the honey they’re buying.
“I hear this from Gary a lot — honeybees are the canary in the coal mine,” McCornack said. “It’s just whether or not we’re willing to listen. And they’re telling us a lot here these last couple years, this last year in particular.”
LaGrange and McCornack easily list stresses on the bee population, from mites to lack of floral resources to chemicals.
As they tackle those problems, both men keep at the forefront the work being done with veterans and others.
“The fact that working with honeybees has the merit of being able to save a life, that’s very special,” LaGrange said. “With all these young men and women whose lives we have helped, we’re making more than a marginal contribution to the problem we have in this country with suicides today, particularly among veterans and now others, maybe farmers and first responders. That’s pretty special.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Beekeeping4-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

Members of the Van Gilder family, which owns the land under consideration for the rezoning and runs a community Facebook page for the project, said on social media Sunday that it pulled the request, upholding their responsibility to be good stewards of the land.
“That responsibility matters deeply to us and while we believe we put forth the best proposal, we also heard from many of you that more study was needed,” the family said on Facebook. “As a result, we believe the right thing to do now is to honor the current moratorium, which will give the township and its residents the time needed to develop thoughtful, well-considered regulations for any future data centers.”
The Howell Township Board of Trustees planned to hear the request tonight at its Monday meeting.

Howell Township is one of a growing number of communities in Michigan raising questions on how they will be impacted if one of these facilities is built within their community as a project reportedly backed by Meta, the parent company for Facebook and Instagram, is planned on more than 1,000 acres of farmland.
Breanne Green, with Stop the Data Centers Livingston County, a leader in the movement to prevent data centers from flourishing, said the withdrawal of the request was a tactical victory but was not a final decision.
“The community will continue to show up, and we expect the Township to protect residents and uphold the master plan. We’re not backing down,” Green said in a statement. “Residents spoke up, that’s what made a difference. But it’s also clear the developer plans to return as soon as they believe they have influenced the process or changed the board’s mind. This is far from over.”
Howell Township Board Trustee Bob Wilson also confirmed that the rezoning application will no longer be before the board on Monday evening. Wilson told Howell-based WHMI-FM that the board received an email about the withdrawn application.
Jonathan Hohenstein, the township board’s treasurer, also told the station that the application was on hold as the township and board worked on regulations for data centers.
“We will still be having a meeting to address the definition of data processing and to allow the public to speak should they still wish,” Hohenstein wrote to the station.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-08 14:40:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi State rolled out changes to campus parking. Some students say they can’t afford it,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/08/mississippi-state-campus-parking/,Recent changes to campus parking at Mississippi State University are unexpected expenses some students struggle to pay.,"STARKVILLE — Since transferring to Mississippi State University from Itawamba Community College in 2022, the cost of parking on campus has always been an issue for Madeline Comer. 
Last spring, Comer got a $50 parking ticket because her license plates weren’t registered properly with the university’s parking services, she said. Comer, a junior studying graphic design, called to dispute the ticket. 
For weeks, she couldn’t reach anyone on staff, she said. Two weeks after the first ticket, she received another $50 ticket for the same issue. She was afraid of racking up other parking citations that might result in progressively higher fines and a “boot” or wheel clamp. 
The citations would have strained her monthly budget as she juggles rent, art supplies for classes, groceries and other bills. 
After weeks of back and forth, parking services dropped the ticket. Comer felt relieved.
Then in July, university officials announced a major parking overhaul that included restructuring campus zones, revamping prices and implementing new tier systems to purchase parking permits. 
Comer knew parking fees would be even more of a problem. But she lucked up. 
She bought a $225 annual commuter parking permit after waiting nearly four hours in an online lottery to apply for her pass, unlike many of her peers, who ended up on a lottery waitlist or getting a pricier permit outside of their desired spot. The annual parking permits can cost up to $650.

Her parking spot is in G3, a lot near Humphrey Coliseum, where the Bulldogs’ basketball teams play. But Comer’s parking spot is nowhere near the majority of her classes in Hunter Hall. She lives 15 minutes from campus, outside of Starkville, and commutes four times a week. 
Weekly costs for gas are now adding up, Comer said.
“It’s just a lot for my bank account to handle,” she said. “Not to mention the rent, groceries and art supplies I also pay for out of pocket.” 
Comer, who is paying for college on her own, works multiple part-time jobs. She is a house cleaner for Airbnb, a barista at a coffee shop and has taken on multiple side hustles as a freelancer, selling her art and designs online. 
Covering unexpected college costs
Mississippi undergraduates leave university with an average of $29,000 of federal loan debt, according to a 2021 report from the Institute of College Access & Success.
The rising cost of in-state tuition over the past few decades, along with additional costs of campus meal plans, textbooks and class supplies, laboratory fees, transportation and off-campus housing have made attending university expensive.

At Mississippi State, tuition has increased slightly in each of the past four years, including a nearly 4% rise from $9,815 in 2023-2024 to $10,202 in 2024-2025 academic year, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. 
On-campus housing starts at $8,456, and meal plans are $5,808 a year — a total of $24,000 for a full academic year. For out-of-state students, costs can soar up to $42,000 a year. 
While the cost for books and supplies have steadied over the past year, the cost of food and housing for students living on and off campus has steadily increased year to year. Data from NCES shows nearly a 5% increase in food and housing expenses and a 4% increase in other expenses between 2023-2025. 
Mississippi State officials said its new parking system allows students to pay less for a permit with guaranteed space, while other universities in the state do the opposite.
“The inherent value of our permit is significantly higher than that of our peers,” Sid Salter, a university spokesman, said in an email.
By comparison, parking permits at the University of Southern Mississippi are $167 for students and $414 for reserved spaces, according to the university’s parking and transit services website. At the University of Mississippi, parking permits for students are $395 for the 2025-2026 academic year. 
But for some students at Mississippi State, the price change for campus parking is just another cost to their already lean budgets.
Kenneth McGowan, senior studying computer engineering, said college students can quickly tally hundreds or up to $1,000 a semester in unexpected expenses. He felt blindsided by the price changes to parking, tuition and dining plans upon returning to campus this semester. He said he had to come up with more than $3,000 extra to get through the year.
McGowan isn’t alone. Nationwide, students reported some level of surprise with the full cost of attending college, including but not limited to tuition and other directly billable expenses, according to survey results from Inside Higher Ed’s Student Voice report. At least a quarter of students have trouble budgeting as a result, according to the report. 
In another set of findings in Inside Higher Ed’s report, 36% of students said an unexpected expense of $1,000, or even less, could threaten their ability to stay enrolled. Another 22% said the same of an expense between $1,001 and $2,500. 
The College Board estimates that indirect expenses can make up 40%–50% of the annual cost for undergraduates. The average full-time undergraduate spends $1,240 per year on books and supplies, according to the College Board report. An estimated 91% of American colleges fail to tell students the full cost of their college education, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. 
To make up for extra college related expenses, McGowan spends his free time with gigs including food pickup and delivery for GrubHub, UberEats and Door Dash. He also picked up another job as a FANgineer, working for catering and event services during Mississippi State football games. 
“The whole thing, it’s just kind of frustrating,” McGowan said of unexpected expenses. 
McGowan said he bought a $225 parking pass for the year. It was another hit in his budget, but he considers himself lucky. He parks his car near Sanderson Center, the student recreation hub, which is near the heart of campus. His engineering classes in McCain Hall are another 10-15 minute walk across campus.

Eli Rowell, a senior studying graphic design, paid $650 for a North Garage parking permit. He was shut out of the lottery process once the university ran out of his preferred parking lot spot: G3, near Howell Hall. 
Rowell works part time as a bartender at Harvey’s restaurant in Starkville to pay for college. He received a scholarship when he transferred from Hinds Community College, but he is paying out of pocket for his next three semesters.
Mississippi State does a “decent job” of breaking down costs for attending the university, Roswell said. But research and transparency from university scholarship and financial aid offices are just as important, he said. 
“Education should be accessible to more people,” Rowell said. “Understanding where your money is going is important. The more information you have about costs, the better you are able to navigate your college experience.” 
McGowan said he wishes the university would be more transparent about price changes. He said he doesn’t know anyone in his friend group who had to pay less due to the changes made at Mississippi State. 
“I just don’t understand the reason or purpose behind it,” McGowan said of increased costs. “MSU used to be affordable.” 
Mississippi State officials said they’ve worked to modernize and improve the parking system to accommodate population growth and changing campus infrastructure. The changes were also to reduce heavy traffic, enhance pedestrian and cyclist safety, and increase usage of existing parking spaces. 
“The plan has worked as it was designed to work,” Salter said. 
This year, MSU sold parking permits on a tiered system, with different prices assigned to parking zones based on proximity to campus and desirability. The most convenient spots at the heart of campus, aside from North Garage, cost $375 for residents and $275 for commuters. Permits for North Garage, located at the center of campus, cost $650.

For commuters, parking breaks down into four tiers, with the lowest level costing $100 to park on the outskirts of campus. Resident parking breaks down into three tiers, with the lowest level costing $150. 
Mississippi State officials were aware of the criticism from students, faculty and residents, including several petitions calling for the resignation of Jeremiah Dumas, executive director of parking services. 
“Parking is a hot-button topic, so such unfair criticism is neither unexpected nor unusual,” Salter said. “The university will continue to work and adjust as necessary to fix issues, but there are none we plan to address. Things are functioning smoothly.”  
It is unclear how much the university profits off of campus parking, but the revenue is used to cover the cost of parking operations, which is more than $2 million, Salter said. It costs an average of $5 million a year to maintain the parking lots and roads on campus, Salter said. 
‘Spending every penny’ to pay for college
Mississippi State offers resources for students who need short-term loans, food security resources, temporary housing assistance and access to devices such as laptops. The university also helps students find on-campus and part-time employment. 
When Comer moved to Starkville, she opted to not buy a parking pass. It was expensive. To save money, she walked 40 minutes from her apartment to classes, trudging along with her portfolio and art supplies. 
“It wasn’t much  fun in the heat and heavy rain. But I made it work,” Comer said. 
She tried taking public transportation, but a bad experience left her not wanting to ride the bus. During Comer’s first year, she was dropped off at a random location on campus and had to find her way back on her own. 
She worked multiple shifts waitressing at a local sports bar to save up for a car.  
Comer doesn’t want to slam her university; she enjoys attending Mississippi State. But she said as someone who is “spending every penny” to put herself through college, speaking up on behalf of other students can make a difference for future students. 
“Parking may seem small to some people,” Comer said, “but it’s just these little costs that make it really hard and often feel like, if you don’t have money, college isn’t for you.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/19120758/3X0A2039.jpg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

The hospital’s governing board in April approved plans for a top-tier cancer center in downtown Charleston, next to Rutledge Tower on MUSC’s campus.
At the time, MUSC Health did not say how much the hospital would cost. Now it’s turning to the General Assembly in hopes of getting taxpayer dollars to cover the bill instead of taking on debt to build it.
The ask comes as MUSC chases a Comprehensive Cancer Center designation from the National Cancer Institute.
If approved, the center would be the first of its kind in South Carolina. Patients seeking this top level of care currently must travel out of state to centers in North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee.
The state-owned hospital system’s cancer hospital holds a tier-two designation as a Clinical Cancer Center. The bump in rankings could mean a bump in National Cancer Institute research grant support — as much as $14 million over five years compared to the $11 million, five-year grant it holds now.
“This investment is crucial for South Carolina, as it facilitates the development of lifesaving treatments, attracts top-tier scientists and jobs, and advances innovations to reduce the state’s cancer burden and mortality rates,” the budget application reads.
The hospital system anticipates a “strong” return on the investment but did not provide further details in its application.
South Carolina is below the national rate in terms of number of cancer cases, according to National Cancer Institute data, but the state has a higher mortality rate from the deadly disease.
There are 57 Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the country. MUSC would apply for its designation in 2028 and the center would open in 2030.
To reach the next level, the cancer center must increase the depth and breadth of its research and broaden its community reach.
The Legislature set aside $5 million worth of recurring payments in the current budget to help pay for the designation effort. That’s on top of $10 million in recurring payments, which the hospital system has received annually since 2022.
SC-owned hospital system set to double debt with 2 new hospitals

The existing center already boasts more than 230 researchers with a more than $50 million portfolio and more than 200 clinical trials, according to the hospital system’s budget application
When MUSC announced the new center, hospital leadership said it would likely have 50 to 100 beds for inpatient treatment but will also house outpatient care. Services will include surgeries, stem cell transplantation, dedicated CT and MRI scanners, chemotherapy and radiation, a lab and pharmacy, as well as pain management and rehab.
In addition to the new center on the peninsula, MUSC is standing up clinics around the state. The hospital system broke ground in September on a clinic in Summerville and it has announced plans for a similar facility in Florence. Leadership also has suggested Orangeburg as a possible clinic location.
Doctors diagnose an average of 780 people with cancer each year in Florence County, according to data from the state Department of Public Health. In Orangeburg County, that number is 519, with breast, prostate and lung cancers being the most common.
MUSC has been on an expansion spree the last several years.
In 2019, the hospital system purchased four rural community hospitals in Florence, Marion, Chester and Lancaster counties and, with the latter two, saw firsthand the growth potential in communities near the North Carolina state line.
In 2021, it again expanded with the purchase of three hospitals and a standalone emergency room in the Midlands. And in 2023, it took over operations of Orangeburg’s hospital.
MUSC Health weighing deal for control of struggling Grand Strand hospitals

A five-member state financial review panel gave the hospital system permission in April to borrow $860 million: $400 million to build a hospital in Summerville’s mega Nexton community, $330 million to build a hospital in Indian Land (the unincorporated panhandle of Lancaster County), and $130 million to finance the equipment for both.
And in September MUSC and Tidelands Health were still finalizing a deal for the state-owned system to take a controlling interest in the Grand Strand area hospitals. Financial details of that deal have yet to be made public.
All of that is on top of a planned purchase by MUSC of Roper St. Francis’ hospital on the peninsula.
The price of that deal will be decided in 2029, when Roper is scheduled to move to a new North Charleston location. In 2022, the Legislature set aside $15 million to help MUSC buy Roper’s to-be-vacated property.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lung-cancer-concept-1024x666.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

Maynard says the administration is not moving quickly enough to inform the public about dire revenue forecast[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Greg Maynard, the Boston Policy Institute







AMERICA MIGHT RUN on Dunkin’, but Boston runs on property taxes. Some 70 percent of the city’s $4.8 billion operating budget depends on levies from residential and commercial properties, which means pandemic-era shifts in work patterns have pushed the burden away from the downtown towers and toward homeowners. 
While this broader workplace and commercial value change is not Mayor Michelle Wu’s doing, her critics argue that a second consecutive double-digit residential tax hike should not be used to ramp up pressure on a struggling commercial sector. Beyond that, they say, the city sat on its potential 2026 tax rate numbers until late in the year when lawmakers were out of formal session.  
Wu announced last week that the city expected residential property taxes to rise 13 percent while the commercial sector could expect an average 4.4. percent drop next year. Since the Boston City Council must vote on Wednesday to approve the new tax rates, she coupled the announcement with a plea for lawmakers and business groups to back Boston’s plan, withering on Beacon Hill, that would shift the property tax burden away from residents and cap the annual increase at 9 percent. 
While these numbers are “surprising today,” the process of releasing the valuations so late in the year highlights a “mismatch between how much information City Hall has and how much information everyone else in this conversation has,” said Greg Maynard, executive director of the Boston Policy Institute, on The Codcast. 
“These are numbers that the city has had all year long. These are numbers that the city has been using all year long. These numbers are used to create the budget that was passed back in June,” said Maynard, whose think tank has a prickly history with Wu. He joined CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith to discuss the tax hike rollout. 
The mayor is currently trading shots with state Sen. Nick Collins of South Boston, who made similar claims about Wu’s timeline in releasing estimates.  
According to WBUR, Wu slammed any “accusations” that her administration withheld or obfuscated the numbers, saying elected officials’ “first responsibility” is to be “honest with our constituents.” 
Last year, Wu’s home rule petition to shift the tax burden toward commercial properties over a three-year period crashed and burned on Beacon Hill, with no hearing in the state Senate and the chamber’s leadership notably cool on the proposal. 
Business leaders, who initially agreed to the home rule’s language as a compromise, justified withdrawing support because of a discrepancy between Boston’s alarming estimates in the fall on the looming residential tax hike and the ultimate certified numbers. In a press briefing last week, administration officials noted that they were very confident about the accuracy of their assessments this year and released a letter announcing the numbers were certified on Friday. 
Maynard called the last-minute push a deliberate move from the city. “This is an issue that’s been warned about for years,” he said of the declining commercial values and their impact on city budgets. “The kinds of questions about, ‘How should Boston respond to this?’ is a conversation that can be had over a long period of time, and it’s a choice that’s been made by this city council, by this mayoral administration, to not have it over a longer period of time — to concentrate it, to manufacture this crisis.” 
On the episode, Maynard discusses the foundation of the property assessments (2:20), how the Wu administration has responded to the commercial downturn (7:00), and the prospects for a third try at the home rule tax shift (20:15).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Nebraska lawmaker two times was denied entry to the controversial state-run federal immigration detention facility that federal officials dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink” —  and now is calling on the Legislature’s Executive Committee to step in.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said Monday that she made the four-hour trip to McCook in mid-November to check out the conditions of the place where migrant detainees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are held pending deportation.

She argues that the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services violated state law by not allowing her into the converted Work Ethic Camp, and cites a state statute that says Nebraska legislators are entitled to visit any state correctional facility “at any time.”
When Gov. Jim Pillen and Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys announced the agreement with the federal government, Cavanaugh said, they stated that the department would manage the property and it would continue to be considered a state facility.
“The denial of physical entry to a sitting senator is not only unprecedented — it is the latest escalation in a broader pattern of obstruction that undermines the Legislature’s statutory and constitutional oversight obligations,” Cavanaugh said.
The Omaha senator said she routinely conducts unannounced visits to state-run 24-hour facilities “because direct oversight is not optional — it is a core responsibility of my job.”
She said she specifically wanted to visit the McCook ICE detention center, because it involved “people being held in Nebraska without criminal charges and, in many cases, without clear legal recourse.” The immigration court and deportation process is separate from state courts, and immigrants held by ICE often face civil versus criminal charges.
“When the state deprives someone of their liberty, the conditions of that confinement must be subject to full public and legislative scrutiny,” she told the Nebraska Examiner. “There is no scrutiny. There is no carve-out in Nebraska law for secrecy just because ICE is involved.”
Neither the Corrections Department nor the Governor’s Office had immediate comment. 
Cavanaugh documented her efforts to gain entry to the former WEC in a letter to State Sen. Ben Hansen, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, and Sen. Myron Dorn, chair of the Legislative Oversight Committee. 
She also chronicled five prior legislative attempts to obtain information about the project, describing a pattern of “limited transparency and restricted information.”
Email between Cavanaugh and Jeffries and a person she described as a warden at the McCook facility offers details of the rejected visits on Nov. 12-13.
According to the email exchange: 
Cavanaugh arrived at the facility around 4:20 p.m. Nov. 12, and apparently spoke to Jeffries via the warden’s cell phone around 4:30 p.m., who told her she had failed to provide notice of her visit. 
Said Jeffries: “You were instructed that no person could arrive unannounced and be given immediate entry to a Nebraska correctional facility or a federal detention center.”
Cavanaugh, in an email around 10 p.m. that night of Nov. 12, emailed the warden and Jeffries that she would be returning to the facility the next morning.
“Though statute 83-186 (attached) does require me to provide notice, I am giving you this notice per my conversation with Director Jeffries on Warden Sommer’s cell phone at approximately 4:30 p.m. today, when Director Jeffries informed me that I had failed to provide notice of my visit.”
Jeffries later wrote to Cavanaugh to “clarify the legal position” of the department as to why she was not allowed to enter. 
“It is the fundamental nature of corrections, safety protocols and operations, and consistent with Nebraska law, that unannounced visitors of any type cannot be accommodated.”
He said her communication alerting them that she’d be there again Nov. 13 was “short notice” and “again a problem.”
Of Cavanaugh’s legal justification for her visit, Jeffries said in email that his team “worked to analyze your request, get legal advice and collaborate with our federal partners.”
“We have come to the determination that you will not be allowed to enter the WEC until you have complied with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement protocols related to detention center visits and provided sufficient notice to allow for the safe conduct of a visit.”
He also said that statute 83-186 “does not displace protocols for the security and safety of corrections facilities.” He said his team read that statute “in harmony with the statutory scheme of which it is a part.”
Cavanaugh, in the letter to Hansen and Dorn, said she reviewed the state’s contract with ICE and believes it provides that any “provision of this agreement contrary to applicable statutes … is null and void and shall not necessarily affect the balance of the agreement.”
“This means that the right of access provided in 83-186 invalidates any interpretation that members of the Legislature may be prohibited from accessing the facility.”
Cavanaugh said the documented history demonstrates that legislative leaders “have repeatedly sought access to accurate, timely information” on the project and its implications. 
She said the Executive Board oversees all legislative services and employees and hears matters of “general import to the Legislature and its operations as a whole.”She said Jeffreys actions were a “direct disregard” of the Legislature and its constitutional authority.
“I urge you … to act to defend the authority of the legislative branch. Such action is necessary to ensure we can effectively represent our constituents and the people of Nebraska.”

The California Highway Patrol graduated 780 new officers this year, including more than 130 cadets on Friday, underscoring the success of the agency’s recruitment push during a once-concerning vacancy rate.
Grappling with vacancies that ballooned 94% between 2015 and 2023, the agency in 2022 asked for $2 million from the state Legislature to hire more officers and launched a recruitment campaign known as the CHP 1000. In recent years, it also received some of its highest pay raises for officers, securing a 7.9% wage increase in 2023 and a $489-million, three-year labor contract in 2024.
Since those efforts kicked off, the agency hired more than 2,300 officers from 2022 and is on track to increase hiring by more than 60%, reports The Sacramento Bee. Applications also jumped by 52% — from more than 16,000 in 2022 to nearly 25,480 in 2024, according to the agency. This year, the CHP is on track to receive more than 33,000 applications.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, in a statement: “As we close out the year, California continues to make real progress — strengthening protections across the state while staying focused on the needs of the people we serve.”

The hiring surge comes as the governor is deploying CHP “crime suppression” teams in six California regions, following similar state intervention efforts in 2024 in Oakland, Bakersfield and San Bernardino. 
Though Newsom denied the teams were expanded in response to what the Trump administration called a crime crackdown in Democratic-led cities, enforcement activity from San Francisco police has reportedly ramped up due to potential threats of federal intervention.

Debating CA’s AI data centers

Artificial intelligence proponents and skeptics of the technology’s promised benefits clashed over how California should approach AI data centers at a recent CalMatters’ event moderated by reporter Alejandro Lazo.
The Nov. 18 panel discussion included Liang Min, the managing director of Stanford University’s Bits & Watts Initiative, who said that forecasting the state’s electricity demand is difficult because since new AI apps roll out quickly. He argued that as AI puts more demands on the grid, the state will need to rely on other sources of power, such as nuclear, geothermal or natural-gas energy.
The explosive growth of data centers are also raising environmental concerns, as well as concerns from utility watchdogs that Californians may end up footing the bill for billions of dollars in grid upgrades. But AI supporters say overregulation could stifle competition in the state.

Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group: “It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states.”

One politician’s fight against pollution

Before voters elected her to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors in July, Paloma Aguirre spent two decades trying to mitigate Tijuana River’s sewage contamination, writes CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan. 
Considered by Aguirre to be one of the worst environmental crises in the country, Tijuana River pollution dates to at least the 1930s. As the population grew in the border Mexican city, its waste exceeded what cross-border sewage plants could handle. In the early 2000s, sewage spills and beach closures along the southern San Diego coast became common. Contamination in the ocean leaves swimmers with illnesses, and toxic gas emissions near the river give residents headaches and nausea.
As the former mayor of Imperial Beach, Aguirre urged California and the federal government to declare a state of emergency over the pollution problem and lobbied to classify the area as a Superfund site. Once she became a county supervisor, she led plans to study the health effects of the pollution, and requested $50 million from the state to help ease the problem in a particularly contaminated area known as the Saturn Boulevard hot spot.

Aguirre: “The river is carrying dangerous chemicals, pollutants, pathogens and toxic gases that are impacting South San Diego communities.”

In a year of profound shifts at the federal level, uncertainty has been the name of the game across the United States. Nowhere is that truer than in the California water world.
Over many decades, the state has forged a symbiotic relationship with federal agencies to manage its notoriously complex — and aging — water system. The state has worked with an alphabet soup of federal agencies to manage some of the worst floods and droughts the state has ever seen. 
Research and technical expertise undergird all water-related activity in California, whether you’re a farmer applying water to your crops, a utility providing clean drinking water to your customers or a municipality trying to protect your community from floods. 
Fortunately the state is blessed with top-notch water experts, hailing from state and federal agencies, universities, consulting firms and nongovernmental organizations. They’re responsible for many of the tools the state uses to manage its water. Any California water action relies on decades of applied research and experienced people to implement it.
Changes at the federal level have put this tight state-federal partnership in doubt. 
The dust has yet to settle on the cuts — including the impact of the recent shutdown — but the effects are already being felt, just as storm season gets underway in California. These cuts already are impacting flood forecasting and emergency response. 
The California-Nevada River Forecast Center is reducing the frequency of its flood predictions. And staff reductions of emergency responders and at regional National Weather Service offices mean fewer people will respond to extreme weather events, which puts Californians at risk. 
The loss of institutional expertise is harder to quantify, though it’s vital to managing droughts and floods, protecting human health and restoring ecosystems.
The state must keep water flowing for the wellbeing of California’s residents, economy, and ecosystems. It’s equally important to be ready for droughts, floods, fires and other natural hazards.
Fortunately, in recent years, Californians have come together to find pragmatic solutions to water problems. 
Voters have shown they are all in on water, with most passing bond measures that fund crucial work. Partnerships once considered impossible — between agriculture and environmentalists, or cities and farms — are becoming the gold standard in this state. 
Research is helping us use scarce water wisely.
In a recent report, we at the Public Policy Institute of California make recommendations for where research dollars should go. We need to keep better track of our water, find new ways of funding big projects and develop new tools for the new problems we’re facing.
“California’s farms, communities, and ecosystems would all benefit from more accurate and timely systems to track how rain and snowmelt move through soils, vegetation, groundwater, rivers, and wetlands,” the study says.
“Just as important are improved tools to monitor and measure water use — across agriculture, cities, and the environment — so that managers can respond quickly and effectively to changing conditions. Without these systems, water planning, management, and emergency services are all hamstrung.”
The challenges confronting California water are not going away. The state will need to step up to fund and maintain the technical expertise needed to manage our water systems.
Now is the time to double down on research. The governor, the Legislature and researchers can work collectively by setting priorities, allocating funds and collaborating with other western states.

In San Jose, supporters see jobs and investment, while a key ratepayer advocate worries customers could end up paying for upgrades.","In summary
Artificial intelligence and its growing demand for data centers are putting new pressure on California’s electric grid. In San Jose, supporters see jobs and investment, while a key ratepayer advocate worries customers could end up paying for upgrades. 


San Jose, the symbolic capital of Silicon Valley, is now ground zero in California’s battle over how to govern the rise of data centers used to power artificial intelligence.
The county seat of Santa Clara is touting its partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric, claiming the city is “the West Coast’s premier destination for data center development.” The investor-owned utility now estimates it has enough capacity in its planning pipeline to push the city’s electricity use to almost three times its current peak.
Those plans are forcing major grid upgrades, PG&E and city officials say, while raising questions about who pays for them and whether the state can keep the power clean.
Panelists at a CalMatters event in downtown San Jose clashed over key issues. They included a local official working with PG&E on the city’s data-center buildout, a tech advocate urging California to seize the economic moment, a Stanford energy expert pressing for a more modernized grid and a utility watchdog skeptical of AI’s promised benefits.
Their discussion centered on how quickly California should move to accommodate new demand, what information the public should be entitled to and how to keep customers from shouldering the cost of infrastructure that may never be fully used.
Proposals to more strictly regulate data center development died in the Legislature this year. Going forward, several state agencies and commissions are expected to take up further discussions, including the California Energy Commission, the Little Hoover Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.


How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?
The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need. Companies can propose large facilities without committing to build them, the computing demands behind AI are changing quickly and cooling needs vary across the state. These factors make long-term energy needs hard to pin down.
According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes, compared with California’s estimated 14 to 15 million. Regulators don’t expect all of those projects to be built, and assume the ones that do will come online gradually and operate at less than their requested capacity, producing a forecast of between 4 and 6 gigawatts by 2040.
Liang Min, who directs Stanford’s Bits & Watts Initiative, and a speaker on CalMatters’ panel, said that forecasting is particularly tough because companies are rolling out new AI apps — or “application layers,” as he put it — at breakneck speed. They include products like ChatGPT that use large language models. No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.
“Right now we’re really struggling,” Min said. “The risk is extremely high in the application layers.”
The Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer watchdog within the California Public Utilities Commission, recently warned that rapid data-center growth could leave Californians paying for billions of dollars in grid upgrades if projects never materialize or use far less power than promised. 
“Ratepayers could end up paying for costly infrastructure upgrades that may not be needed for many years – or at all,” the office said in its commentary.
Min said forecasting data-center load is a national challenge, but California will need better tools to keep rates in check, meet its clean-energy targets and stay competitive with states racing to attract data centers and high-paying tech jobs.
Local officials have also begun to grapple with the uncertainty. In San Jose, city energy officials say they are reluctant to procure additional power until they know which projects will actually be built. “We do not want to buy more power than we need,” said panelist Lori Mitchell, director of San Jose Clean Energy, the city’s publicly-owned electricity provider. “That’s job No. 1.”
What are the environmental concerns around the data center boom? 
California’s data-center boom is bringing a wave of environmental concerns that state officials are only beginning to understand. Those concerns center on water use, the carbon emissions tied to rising energy demand and the air pollution from diesel backup generators.
Air quality is a particular concern. While back-up generators run only intermittently, their presence is concentrated in a handful of regions. In Santa Clara County, where many facilities sit close together in dense industrial areas, the local impacts could be greater simply because so much equipment is packed into a small space.
Yet the state still has limited visibility into what data centers are doing. Attempts to require more transparency stalled this year amid tech industry opposition. The only measure that became law gives regulators the authority to determine whether data centers are driving up costs — but stops short of requiring environmental reporting.
Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and another panelist, said his group opposed the electricity disclosure and water reporting measures because they would make California less competitive.
“It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states,” he added.
Consumer advocates say the lack of information leaves communities unprotected. “We certainly think there needs to be more transparency — that’s a good thing,” said panelist Mark Toney, the executive director of the The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group..
Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy? 
The rapid growth of data centers could slow California’s clean-energy transition if it keeps the state tied to natural gas. And some of the carbon-free alternative energy sources that could meet their power needs are deeply controversial among environmentalists.
The state has pledged to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, yet it still depends heavily on natural-gas plants during hot summer days. A recent report by the environmental think tank Next 10 and UC Riverside estimated that data-center carbon emissions nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023 — largely from gas-fired generation — underscoring how even a relatively clean grid may struggle to absorb AI-driven load without higher emissions.
State leaders are making policy shifts as AI demand grows. California this year approved joining a broader Western power market, a move driven in part by new demands on the grid, including data centers. Critics warn the change could expose the state to dirtier electricity from other states and weaken its control over clean-energy rules.
Min of Stanford argues that California will need to rely on options some environmentalists would rather avoid. That includes holding onto existing resources like the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. In a recent report, Min argued the state will also need more “clean, firm” power — resources that can operate around the clock — such as geothermal energy or natural-gas plants with carbon capture.
PG&E agrees. Spokesperson Stephanie Magallon told CalMatters in an email that nuclear power, carbon-capture systems and large solar-plus-battery projects are all options under consideration for powering data centers in its region. But environmental justice critics in California have opposed carbon capture technology calling it unproven tech that risks extending fossil-fuel use.
Mitchell said community choice aggregators can manage new data-center load while keeping power clean and affordable. San Jose’s mix is already 60% renewable, and she said the biggest opportunity is flexibility — getting data centers to shift use off the hottest afternoons so the city can avoid buying additional power.
Will data centers raise your electric bill? 
California’s data-center boom is reshaping the fight over electricity bills, exposing a divide over whether these new customers will lower costs — or drive them higher for everyone else.
PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers. It also claims the grid is underutilized on average — operating at about 45% of capacity — although the grid faces real strain during the hottest hours and in parts of the system that routinely run close to their limits. If data centers can be connected in places with available capacity, PG&E argues, they could help spread costs without worsening congestion.
Toney, another panelist, urged the state to slow down, warning that California is planning major infrastructure without knowing which data centers are real or how their costs will land on customer bills.
“I’m worried that we’re engaged in what I call faith-based policymaking,” he said. “The benefits are very speculative, but the costs are very real.”
Some states, said Toney, have begun tightening rules around the growth of data centers. One law in Oregon will require data-center grid costs to remain off household bills.  A Minnesota law will give very large data centers their own billing category so regulators can keep their costs separate from other customers’ electric bills.
“This issue of data centers and the connection between affordability and clean energy is of national concern, and California is actually behind on this,” Toney said. “There’s this mythology about California being the leader all the time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120425_Edgecloud-Link-Data-Center_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

According to the financial consultant WalletHub, Utah places last on metrics measuring income disparity, and inequality in the state’s share of executive positions. 
The Utah Women and Leadership Project at Utah State University in partnership with the state published a brief studying 100 Utah companies that have implemented best practices that allow Utah women to succeed in the workplace. A fundamental one is the implementation of flexible work hours in addition to other family-friendly policies.

“Research on the importance of implementing flexible and family-friendly policies, programs, and practices in workplaces has been well documented,” the brief says. “In fact, there is a clear, direct link between companies that implement such strategies and the retention and advancement of women.”
The researchers have been measuring family friendly and women-focused initiatives in different workplaces in the state for three years, including paid and unpaid family leave, back-to-work maternity support, child care support, and adoption and fertility benefits. This year fewer companies reported offering those perks.
While 71% had unpaid family leave available — more than the 64% recorded in 2024 — only 63% offered paid maternity leave, less than the 69% reported in 2024. Also, 20% had adoption and fertility benefits, less than the 27% seen last year.

Susan Madsen, director of the Utah Women and Leadership Project, said she was particularly surprised to see a lower percentage of child care support, which went from 34% in 2024 to 25% this year.
“We’ve been talking about that more the last three years here in the state of Utah,” Madsen said. “And women and families need child care support most. In most families, if there’s two parents in the home, both of them are working, and so child care is really important.”
The benefit doesn’t necessarily translate into a child care center in the workplace, or stipends to cover day care expenses, Madsen said. 
“There’s a lot of other things that could be possible in helping and trying to support parents, not just women, with child care,” she said. “Sick days, letting people do remote work when their kids are sick, or various things like that.”
There was still a good number of companies that offered flexible hours in the list the researchers studied, though it went from 98% last year to 94% in 2025. Remote work was also available at 83% of the workplaces this year, less than the 91% seen in 2024.



Let us know what you think...


 


“These are some of the top companies or top organizations. It’s just interesting to see what they’re doing and what things are jumping to the top of the list,” Madsen added. “For women, flexible work hours and some options for remote work just continue to be absolutely critical.”
Another popular initiative among the 100 companies was an annual review of pay equity, with 82% of the organizations reporting they conduct studies on everyone’s salaries.
“We can’t generalize it to the rest of the population. I’m sure there’s a lot of workplaces that don’t do these things and are not really concerned about doing things,” Madsen said. But it gives us as companies and workers a good look at what people are doing. What should we look at doing more in our organizations?” 
The report encouraged other organizations to open opportunities to make a more inclusive workplace for women. It also recommended that state legislators consider and support policies that will help Utah to host more family-friendly workplaces. 
“When businesses consider organizational-level strategies, initiatives and programs, including family-friendly practices and policies that support all employees and help them thrive, Utah can increase the representation of women in businesses around the state, which is important to ensure more women and their families can thrive,” researchers wrote.

(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Amid ongoing federal and state attempts to limit access to vaccines or loosen vaccination requirements, data shows that Alabama has fallen below national averages for children being up to date on some vaccines.
The state is trailing the country for uptake of vaccines for whooping cough and Hepatitis B, while immunization rates against measles have swung above and below rates that experts consider necessary to attain herd immunity.
The vaccination rate for children aged 13-17 nationwide remained high in 2024, but it drops significantly in Alabama as children age. Where about 70% of 4-10-year-olds are up to date on vaccines statewide, only 25% of children 11-18 years old are up to date.

Experts say misinformation and struggles to access medical care around the state are playing a role.
“There were several insurance companies that didn’t even cover routine immunizations,” Dr. Norma Mobley, a Mobile-based pediatrician, said. “We at the AAP level, that was something that they really worked hard toward making sure that all children under insurance policies could receive routine, recommended vaccines.”
Mobley, president of the Alabama chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), has started to see cases of whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory infection, despite a vaccine for the disease existing for nearly 30 years. 
Statewide, 69% of Alabama’s 19-47-month-olds are up to date on the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, according to data from ADPH. Nationwide, 80.4% of children in the U.S. are vaccinated against whooping cough by the time they turn two in 2021, according to the CDC. The CDC recommends doses of the DTaP vaccine at one- and two-months-old.
Mobley said in an interview Tuesday that she has seen younger parents as more hesitant to vaccinate their children. That, along with how long it takes for a child to be fully vaccinated has led to the return of diseases that are no longer common, she said.
“If you’re going to give them the vaccines, you might as well just do them the way they’re scheduled,” Mobley said “You’re still going to poke them the same number of times, whether you do them a week apart or not.”
Misinformation from social media has also contributed to a decrease in vaccinations, especially for influenza vaccines, Mobley said.
“We had a lot of people reading sources saying that there’s a combination of the flu and the COVID vaccine,” she said. “That’s not true.”
Influenza

According to the ADPH data, 6.3% of Alabamians 18 years old and under were vaccinated against influenza for the 2025-26 flu season as of Nov. 25. The season spans from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, 2026, according to ADPH. In the 2024-25 flu season, 13.1% of children were vaccinated against influenza, according to the data. The CDC recommends a flu shot every year starting at 6-months-old, with some children needing two doses.
According to the ADPH data, about 345,000 adults have gotten the flu vaccine so far this season, which is about half of all adults that received the vaccine in the 2024-25 season.
Dr. Wes Stubblefield, district medical officer at ADPH, said the best way to combat misinformation on vaccines is a good patient-physician relationship.
“We want to make sure that our providers are having conversations with their parents, with their patients and parents, especially those that have questions about vaccines or or have not received vaccines in the past,” Stubblefield said in an interview Wednesday. 
Efforts to loosen vaccination requirements have taken hold in the Alabama Legislature. A bill sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, that would have allowed parents to declare their children religiously exempt from vaccines failed in the 2025 session, but Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, pre-filed a similar bill for the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January.  
HB 24 would allow parents or guardians to object to vaccination or testing requirements by submitting a written statement stating that the vaccination or testing conflicts with their religion as valid grounds for exemption from any school enrollment vaccine or testing requirement. It also specified that no additional forms, fees or documentation could be required of the parent, guardian or child for enrollment in any public K-12 school. The bill would have also extended these provisions to public colleges and universities. 
Mobley said vaccinating children is ethical practice because it keeps children out of harm’s way.
“We take a vow when we graduate from medical school to do no harm,” she said. “If we know we’re holding back on something that could place that patient at risk, then to me, that’s placing them in harm’s way.”
Friday, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to end a 35-year recommendation to vaccinate infants against hepatitis B virus (HBV) on the day they are born. The new recommendation is to only vaccinate infants whose mothers test positive for the disease or have not tested. 
According to the Mayo Clinic, HBV is a viral liver disease that can be transmitted through sexual or blood contact with somebody who is not vaccinated or from a mother to her baby. It can cause liver failure, liver cancer and cirrhosis. For most, the disease lasts six months or less, but it can also be chronic. 
According to the ADPH data, about 76% of 19-47-month-olds in Alabama are up to date on the HBV vaccine. It is one of two vaccines infants get the day they are born. According to the CDC, 91.4% of children in the U.S. were fully vaccinated against HBV by the time they turned two in 2021.

Amid outbreaks of the disease around the country, Alabama reported a confirmed case of measles this year, the first in the state since 2002. An unvaccinated child under five years old contracted the highly contagious disease while traveling outside the country. ADPH later said the child recovered.
Mobley said she has not seen any pushback against the MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control, measles immunity has moved up and down in recent years. About 95.3% of Alabama kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles in the 2024-25 school year, more than the 95% considered necessary for herd immunity. But it was about 93.8% for kindergarteners the year prior.  
“Herd immunity is 95% so we’re still pretty close. We’re doing a good job in our state in that regard,” she said.
According to the ADPH data, 77% of children under 10 are up to date on the MMR vaccine. According to Cleveland Clinic, children typically receive the second dose of the vaccine between four and six years old.
Some counties, especially in Dale, Henry and Houston in the Wiregrass, have significantly lower vaccination rates, according to the data. Mobley said there are small groups of parents throughout the state that are either skeptical, hesitant or against vaccinating their kids. 
“The only thing that we try to make sure they do is go through the health department to obtain those exemptions so that it is documented through the registry, so we know who’s not immunized,” Mobley said of those who seek vaccine exemptions.
Stubblefield said that access to health care could contribute to it, especially in Wiregrass counties, like Dale, Henry and Houston. According to the data, 49% of 19-47-month-old children are up to date on vaccines in Dale County. Henry and Houston counties are at 53% and 52%, respectively, for the same age group. Statewide, 65% of the same age group is up to date.
“We also have some counties in Alabama that have very limited access to vaccinations in general, particularly in the south central and southwest part of the state,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Child-getting-vaccine-for-Aug-29-2025-story.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

Amid economic uncertainty, the panel charged with estimating Nevada state government revenues kept projections modest earlier this year.
It appears their caution was warranted.
On paper, Nevada’s revenue appears to be exceeding its forecast by 6.7%. But that number is artificially inflated by administrative anomalies, state legislative staff told the Economic Forum on Friday.
True performance, after accounting for anomalies that created one-time windfalls, is around 2% above the deliberately cautious forecast.
“We were purposefully being conservative” when finalizing the biennium revenue forecast earlier this year, said forum member Marvin Leavitt, “and it looks like that’s fairly close to what’s actually been happening.”
Expecting the dramatic shift in U.S. economic policy following the election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term — policy that has been rubber-stamped by the Republican-controlled Congress —  the Nevada Economic Forum approved a conservative revenue forecast in December 2024. Then, they nudged that forecast down in May 2025 in response to the first few months of the new administration, including the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs Trump had announced a month earlier.
A bumpy rollout of the state’s tax collection system, combined with a massive cyberattack on the state, led to around $80 million in commerce tax revenue being collected in the first quarter of the current fiscal year when it should have been collected during the previous fiscal year.  Another unique accounting matter stemmed from the Legislature  shortening the timeframe for businesses to transfer money categorized as unclaimed revenue to the state, accounting for a one-time revenue boost of $120 million.
Excluding those anomalies, sales tax revenue is slightly underperforming and commerce tax revenue is basically flat.
“The forecast right now is holding,” said top state fiscal analyst, Michael Nakamoto. “I think that all things considered, it is doing quite well right now.”
Sales tax is by far the largest generator of state revenue, comprising close to a third of general fund revenue. Trump’s re-election sparked alarms among economists about the impact of tariffs and a global trade war.
Among the state’s other major sources of revenue, the insurance premium tax is performing best — 10.3% above forecast after one quarter of tax collections.
Gaming revenue, the second largest revenue generator for the state, is 8.7% above its forecast after five months of tax collections, but Nakamoto cautioned against interpreting that as anything but “we’re doing okay right now.”
Annual visitor volume to Southern Nevada is down 7.6% as of October, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Flights in and out of Harry Reid International Airport were down 8.2% in October 2025 compared to October 2024, and down 5.1% year over year.
Gaming revenue is trending downward in Clark County if you remove baccarat, according to Nakamoto. Baccarat is dominated by a small number of high-end players who spend “a whole lot of money.”
“Sometimes they are lucky, and sometimes they are not,” said Nakamoto. “I think the easy way to explain this is: The houses have gotten very lucky from a (small) number of people, and because baccarat is effectively, statistically, a coin flip, that could very easily swing the other direction.”
Nevada’s live entertainment tax (LET) is currently 1.3% below its forecast, though there is a stark difference in performance when broken down by gaming and non-gaming properties.
LET from events not associated with gaming venues — like The Sphere, T-Mobile Arena, or Allegiant Stadium — are up 44.7% after three months of tax collections. LET from events at venues inside a casino property are down 23.9% after four months of tax collections.
Two other revenue streams categorized as “major” by the forum are both underperforming against their forecasts after one quarter of tax collections. Modified business tax is down 4.3%, and real property transfer tax is down 4.8%.
Non-major revenue sources are down by 14.5% year to date.
Notable among those: Nevada’s transportation connection excise tax, which captures taxis and rideshare services, is down nearly 40% in the first three months of collections.
Similarly, revenue from short-term car rentals started out the fiscal year badly — down 30% after four months.
While not major revenue sources, those revenue streams are often seen as indicators of tourism strength.
The Economic Forum did not make any adjustments to the state forecast on Friday.
The forum is expected to reconvene in June for another check in on Nevada’s economy and state revenues.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2210332783-1024x540.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

Nuclear Advisory Council)For me, the news surrounding the future of the V.C. Summer site is more than an industry headline. It feels like a homecoming.
I started my career at V.C. Summer, working alongside hundreds of dedicated engineers, technicians and community leaders who believed deeply in the promise of nuclear energy. We believed in what the project could mean for the state — reliable power, good-paying jobs, and a long-term investment in South Carolina’s economic resilience.
Those early years shaped not only my professional path but my commitment to advancing nuclear energy as a force for progress.
Seeing momentum return to V.C. Summer brings both pride and hope.
Pride because I know the caliber of the people who poured their expertise, sweat and heart into the site.
Hope because the renewed attention signals something bigger — a second chance to fulfill the potential this project has always held.
The future of V.C. Summer isn’t just about reactors, concrete, or systems.
It’s about people. It’s about the workforce that will be trained, the families who will thrive on new opportunities, and the communities that will benefit.
When a state commits to developing nuclear infrastructure, it commits to stability, innovation, and economic strength for decades to come.
That’s why events like the 2nd Annual South Carolina Nuclear Summit are so important to our state and industry.
Leaders from across the country will gather here in South Carolina to discuss the future of nuclear energy, the electric grid and the role our state can play in strengthening the energy landscape.
As someone who began his career at V.C. Summer, I see this summit as a powerful opportunity for professionals to come together, share ideas and advance the conversations that will shape our region’s growing need for nuclear infrastructure, reactor development, and reliable clean energy.
New nuclear power plants don’t make sense for South Carolina

South Carolina is uniquely positioned right now.
With the right vision, V.C. Summer can be a catalyst — not only for energy generation but for job creation, technology development, and statewide economic growth.
As someone who has spent nearly two decades in nuclear development, both in the field and through years of research leadership, I’ve seen firsthand what successful deployment requires.
It takes technical excellence, committed leadership, intentional planning, and a shared belief in the long-term value of clean, reliable energy.
It also takes experienced teams who understand the complexities of nuclear development from design to deployment — and who know how to get the work done safely and responsibly.
V.C. Summer shaped the beginning of my career.

McKinney Award by the National Homelessness Law Center,Sonya Quick,,,,,https://calmatters.org/inside-the-newsroom/2025/12/homelessness-award/,"CalMatters’ homelessness coverage this year has spanned multiple investigations, stories and resources that led to real-world impact.","In summary
CalMatters’ homelessness coverage this year has spanned multiple investigations, stories and resources that led to real-world impact.


CalMatters was honored with the Stewart B. McKinney Award by the National Homelessness Law Center in November. The awards honor “leaders who raise awareness about and advance solutions to homelessness and poverty.”
As a part of its 2025 Human Right to Housing awards, the center highlighted CalMatters’ “multi-part, multimedia series, spending several months interviewing experts on homelessness, doing a deep dive on all available data and most importantly, visiting encampments to document firsthand how enforcement efforts have displaced unhoused people and the devastating aftermath of these cruel and inhumane sweeps. It is exactly this type of journalistic integrity that our country so desperately needs in this time of misinformation, and we are so grateful for the high-quality reporting that CalMatters is bringing to the homelessness crisis.”
CalMatters reporting has captured the day-to-day reality for homeless people on the streets of California.
A great example of this is our series documenting the impact of Grants Pass v. Johnson, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities did not have to have a shelter bed available before punishing someone for sleeping on the street. That ruling, stemming from an ordinance enacted by an Oregon town, has had huge consequences for California, home to more unhoused individuals than any other state, more than 187,000 by the most recent count.
CalMatters journalists spent four months interviewing experts, requesting data and making a dozen visits to encampments in San Francisco and Fresno to document enforcement efforts and follow the unhoused people displaced when their camps were cleared. Our public media partner, KPBS, did extensive reporting and visits to encampments in San Diego. 
Our reporting showed that every time a homeless person is forced to move, the odds that they lose something increase. That can include identification and documentation critical to obtaining housing and the medication a person needs to survive. Moving also makes it harder for someone to stay in touch with case managers and social workers working to get homeless people into housing.
Homeless Californians also have more difficulty getting to jobs and keeping appointments like court dates. Every time they get arrested or forced to move, that gets harder. Missed court dates can eventually lead to warrants and fines: More barriers to obtaining housing and getting off the street.
CalMatters’ homelessness coverage also spanned multiple investigations, stories and resources. Our work has led to real-world impact.
Two California families were reunited in 2025 after seeing loved ones who are homeless quoted in CalMatters articles. One woman found her sister after losing contact with her in 2019. Another woman found her father, who she’d been searching for without luck. In addition to sharing the stories of these two families, CalMatters also created a resource on what to do if your loved one is homeless.
Fremont backed down after proposing a ban on ‘aiding and abetting’ homeless encampments.
In 2025, Fremont’s city council revised a new city camping ordinance, removing what had become a controversial clause — first reported on by CalMatters — that could have punished those “aiding and abetting” encampments. The ordinance makes it illegal to camp on streets, sidewalks, parks and other public property, but what separated it from other efforts was explicit language that would make anyone “causing, permitting, aiding, abetting or concealing” an illegal encampment guilty of a misdemeanor. Local homeless advocates feared this could be enforced against  workers and volunteers providing aid to unhoused people in Fremont.
Lawmakers advanced a new bill to increase homeless shelter oversight, citing our reporting as the catalyst for action.
Under the new proposal, local governments would be required to perform annual inspections of taxpayer-funded shelters, and cities and counties could lose state funding if they fail to correct code violations or keep neglecting to file mandatory reports. The bill has passed the assembly and is on to the senate. The 2025 proposal followed a CalMatters exposé on homeless shelter failures, and our 2024 investigation revealing that cities and counties have been ignoring a state law requiring basic safety and sanitation checks in shelters. Watch lawmakers discuss this bill, and our reporting. 
A CalMatters lawsuit forced LA officials to turn over secret homeless shelter complaints.
In 2025, Los Angeles officials began releasing thousands of internal records related to conditions inside homeless shelters in response to a CalMatters lawsuit challenging their repeated public records denials. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, better known as LAHSA committed to releasing at least 175 incident reports every other week until the public records request is fulfilled. The agency estimated there are 5,000 such reports.

Under the new rule, no more than 30% of federal grants received by jurisdictions from the program can go toward funding permanent housing. 
Nevada could lose an estimated $13 million in funding and an estimated 925 people would lose housing, according to the NAEH analysis.
The move is expected to displace 170,000 people nationally.
The new requirement came as a surprise since Congress already authorized the funds “to be a two year funding cycle,” said Catrina Peters, the Homeless Services Coordinator with Washoe County.
As the Trump administration has reversed long-standing approaches to homelessness, local governments and nonprofits that rely on federal funding to support homeless programs have been preparing for future changes. 
Yet the funding notice was still unanticipated, Peters said. 
“We would really love to at least have some time to be able to plan for these changes, and have a little runway to be able to work with folks on what some different options might be, instead of just being pushed off a cliff, which is what it feels like right now,” she said. 
Both Clark and Washoe counties dedicate close to 90% of its federal Continuum of Care funding toward permanent housing, the NAEH found. 
“For us, that’s a $1.9 million cut to programs that are currently housing people,” Peters said. 
The NAEH analysis estimates 738 beds will be lost in Clark County, 139 beds in Washoe County, and 48 in the rest of the state. 
The “most conservative” estimate projected by Washoe County indicates 88 households would lose assistance, Peters said, adding the figure doesn’t factor in other potential changes to eligibility requirements, such as proposed work requirements the administration has proposed to place on housing assistance.
Regardless, the most vulnerable populations, including those with disabilities and seniors, could potentially lose housing under the new rules. 
“When we think about people with a permanent disability, which is an eligibility criteria for people to get on the program, that’s unlikely to change,” Peters said. “Once folks get into the housing programs, reducing that funding puts those folks who are in those programs at risk” of re-entering homelessness. 
Clark County wouldn’t confirm if the breakdown provided by NAEH was accurate. 
“This is an emerging challenge that we are currently working to navigate,” Jennifer Cooper, a spokeswoman for Clark County, said in an email. “It would be appropriate for us to engage with you on this when we have information to share.” 
HUD’s swift and sudden reversal comes as the Trump Administration has vowed to move away from the “housing first” approach to homelessness, which focuses on getting people stably housed before treatment. 
Despite “housing first” being supported by homeless advocates, social service providers, and state and local jurisdictions, the administration has pushed to prioritize treatment before housing. 
Trump issued an executive order in July that sought to crack down on homelessness by pressuring cities to criminalize unhoused people or push them into institutions, and called for “ending support for ‘housing first’ policies,” saying they “deprioritize accountability.”
Peters said they have continued to use the housing first model ​​because of a “mountain of evidence showing its effectiveness.”
NAEH and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, along with several municipal governments, filed a lawsuit last week against the administration over the new requirements, warning the sudden changes are reckless and will lead to a steep rise in homelessness. 
The groups argued the two-year funding cycle authorized by Congress in 2024 sought to give communities greater stability in how they run programs used to house people. 
“It rescinded the two-year notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) and replaced it with a new one, initiating a new competition for FY 2025 awards,” according to the lawsuit. “This decision will severely delay essential funding for housing, as HUD now says it will not make any new awards until May at the earliest.”
Twenty states and the District of Columbia have also filed suit to stop the rules, arguing they violate federal law.
Nevada has not joined any of the lawsuits. 
Alcinia Whiters, a spokeswoman for Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, said the state didn’t join the lawsuit because state agencies, such as the Nevada Housing Division and the Department of Human Services “do not receive HUD Continuum of Care funding.”
Rather it is the counties that receive funding directly from HUD.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54642266096_fd9c809767_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Back in 1997, a group of students formed an organization for gay and lesbian undergraduates at Fordham University. They applied for official club status at our Catholic school.
As the time and setting may suggest, this was far more difficult than it should have been. After a lot of temporizing, the administration denied the LGBTQ+ group status. The reasons were nonsensical. And those of us who worked at the campus newspaper, The Ram, said as much in an editorial.
What did the university do to us?
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Nothing.
We continued to cover our campus, and the people on it, as best we could. And while individual administrators grumbled, they didn’t interfere. At some level, the school recognized that it was better for the community to let students speak about their thoughts, their experiences and their hopes, even when those weren’t the same as the administration’s.
I thought back to this last week after the University of Alabama shut down two student magazines — Alice, aimed at women, and Nineteen Fifty-Six, covering Black culture and lifestyle — claiming that their existence was an affront to the Trump administration’s project of driving anyone who isn’t a white man out of public life.
There was no other reason to close the publications. Both found a balance between major issues and lighter fare, as good magazines do. Alice had articles on shoes and tattoos, as well as features on UA workers and a thoughtful essay on women and body images.
One recent issue of Nineteen Fifty-Six had solid pieces on evolving definitions of family and the popular exploitation of Black childhood, as well as recipes and songs.
You’d have to be the most brittle person on the planet to consider anything published by these magazines offensive, let alone discriminatory. Unfortunately, we live under the rule of people whose skin could be punctured by a feather.
To justify the closures, UA Vice President for Student Life Steven Hood cited a July memo from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Like other attempts at discrimination — including Alabama’s — the language is absurdly, purposefully broad.
Hood said the magazines operated as “unlawful proxies.” Bondi defined these as “ostensibly neutral criteria that function as substitutes for explicit consideration of race, sex, or other protected characteristics.”
This is vague to the point of meaninglessness. Which a halfway competent attorney — and UA has many skilled ones — could point out.  If the school felt that its student organizations risked legal attack, it could mount a very good case in court.
And, in fact, Bondi gave them ammunition. The memo goes on to cite examples of “unlawful proxy” as asking job candidates to describe how their backgrounds inform their performance, or recruiting from areas because of racial or ethnic composition, or daring to state how racism shaped their lives.
This is all discriminatory in the arrogant, smugger-than-thou way of this White House. But nowhere does Bondi suggest that a publication aimed at a particular group of students would violate the administration’s already absurd policies against diversity, equity and inclusion.
That’s a fight UA could have.
But it won’t. If anything, school leadership seems to be using the memo for its own purposes.
When students and professors sued the university over its closures of dedicated spaces for the Black Student Union and LGBTQ+ students — thanks, SB 129 — attorneys for UA said the memo justified their refusal to bring the spaces back.
At first, this only seemed craven. But at some point, cowardice became connivance.
Hood said there were no complaints about Alice or Nineteen Fifty-Six that led to their suspension. So one has to conclude that the university is shutting these  publications on its own initiative. There’s nothing in the Bondi memo that can possibly justify this.
Which leads to the inevitable question: What does UA want its students to be?
Should its graduates emerge from Tuscaloosa as independent, open-minded people who can think, express themselves clearly and learn from other people’s experiences?
Or should they be meek, sheltered and deferential individuals, hostile to anything that’s different and silent if they don’t conform?
Right now, UA is leaning toward the latter. The school is telling Black and female students that they are not part of the campus community. And that their experiences, no matter how mundane, are illegitimate and threatening.
That they need to shut up. UA isn’t bending the knee. It’s helping Trump lift the wall.
To their credit, UA students aren’t falling silent. Look no further than the Crimson White, UA’s undergraduate newspaper. It broke the news of the shutdown and continues to report on the situation with calm, clarity and context.
It’s student media at its best: forthright, informed and earnest. As Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six were. Taking a community not as a blob to be shoved into a mold, but the sum of many different parts. Each worthy of exploration and understanding.
UA administrators might learn something from that.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

The Alabama Professional Workforce Protection Act, sponsored by Rep. Napoleon Bracy, D-Saraland, would recognize nursing, physician assistants; physical therapy; education; counseling; social work; public health; speech-language pathology; accounting engineering, and architecture as professional programs. All were excluded from recent decisions by the White House, which the Trump administration has said was an effort to cap maximum borrowing for certain degrees.
Bracy, who works at a federally qualified health center in South Alabama, said in an interview earlier this month the changes could deter students.

“I noticed that more and more people started to kind of talk about it,” he said. “And it was kind of making people look at changing their minds about career fields and paths that they were looking at going forward, maybe not being able to become a nurse practitioner or physician, just seemed like it created an additional burden on people, and I felt like we needed to do something about it.”
According to the Code of Federal Regulations, a professional degree shows completion of both academic requirements and professional skills that are more than a typical bachelor’s degree requires. Professional licenses are also typically required for these degrees.
The changes to professional student classificationswere first outlined in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer.
The U.S. Department of Education said in a statement on Nov. 24 that a professional degree is “an internal definition used by the department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits.”
“Misinformation on TikTok has caused confusion about the Trump Administration’s ongoing actions to implement student loan caps for graduate students. While still in development, the Trump administration is implementing long-needed loan limits on graduate loans to drive down the cost of programs,” Ellen Keast, press secretary for higher education, said in a statement last week.
Previously, graduate students seeking professional degrees could borrow up to the cost of attendance in federal student loans. Now, under the new limits, professional degree seekers, including those in medicine (M.D.), dentistry (D.D.S./D.M.D.) and law (L.L.B./J.D.), can borrow up to $200,000 while those not in a professional degree program can borrow up to $100,000.
Keast’s statement said that 95% of nursing students would not be affected, while “the most expensive outlying 5%” would be grandfathered into existing limits. 
“We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms,” the statement said.
Keast did not mention what data the department received this information from or what TikTok videos have caused misinformation.
The Alabama Board of Nursing (ABN) and the Alabama Hospital Association (ALAHA) wrote to the U.S. Department of Education in a joint letter on Nov. 26 saying that recognizing nursing as a professional degree “is necessary to ensure that our state and nation can meet the challenges facing the healthcare workforce.”
“A professional degree carries with it significant financial advantages for individuals pursuing post-baccalaureate education to advance in various professions, which, under current regulations, include medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, among others,” the letter said. “Given the rigor of educational, licensing, and regulatory policies required to obtain and maintain licensure as a nurse, as well as long-standing public regard of the discipline as a distinct profession, it is natural that nursing should be included in this definition.”
Honor Ingel, chief communications officer for ABN said in an interview Friday the board stands by the letter.
“We’re not speaking to the Department of Education’s intent there. We just believe that we should not be interfering with the pipeline at this time for healthcare workers specifically,” Ingel said.
Bracy said Alabama is experiencing a “workforce crisis.”
Alabama workforce participation rate has trailed the nation’s for at least 50 years. According to the Alabama Department of Workforce, the state’s workforce participation rate in August was 57.7%. This is lower than the national average of 62.4% reported in September. Experts have cited several factors, including a lack of training, a lack of transportation and a lack of child care for Alabama’s lagging rate. 
Alabama State Superintendent Eric Mackey said after the October State Board of Education meeting the state is seeing a shortage in special education teachers even after funding from the Alabama Legislature.
“[The funding] has helped but what we’re continuing to see is that we have a shortage of special needs teachers especially in rural areas, and especially in areas like autism,” Mackey said.
Ingle said the healthcare industry is also experiencing a shortage due to older generations retiring.
“As the as the final Baby Boomers and Generation X start to retire, we are we’re looking at potentially, you know, major drop in the number of nurses Practicing and providing care to Alabamians, and that includes Advanced Practice Nurses, [Certified Registered Nurse Infusions] CNIs, [Certified Registered Nurse Practitioners] CRNPs and [Certified Nurse-Midwives] CNMs.”
Bracy said the Professional Workforce Protection Act would protect incentives for workers.
“If we protect [these degrees], it allows people to have more of an incentive to go into these career paths where taking this away, it really hurts them in the long run,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-08 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,About 36K in CT are at risk of losing SNAP benefits. Here’s what to know.,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/ct-snap-cuts-big-beautiful-bill/,"Cuts to SNAP in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will affect thousands of people, who could lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.","About 36,000 Connecticut residents are at risk of losing access to food stamp benefits due to new eligibility requirements outlined in a recent federal bill.
The cuts to food assistance in H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will directly affect thousands of immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness because of new, stricter work requirements and other changes. They are expected to lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.
The people affected represent about 10% of the state’s residents who receive benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“We’re going to have a whole lot of people who don’t have access to the food they need to stay healthy,” said Sara Parker McKernan, policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance. “People are going to eat as frugally as they can, which means a lot of really inexpensive foods that they’re able to buy because they don’t have the advantage of SNAP anymore.”
Here’s what’s happening with food assistance changes under the bill.
Who is affected by the changes?
H.R. 1 imposes a work requirement on adults 55 through 64 and parents with children 14 and older for the first time. It removes exemptions for veterans, people experiencing homelessness and young people who recently aged out of foster care — exemptions that were added in bipartisan legislation in 2023, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. Recipients must now document 20 hours of work per week, participate in a narrow set of work activities or prove they qualify for another exemption.
The bill also ends eligibility for many immigrants living lawfully in the U.S. who have been granted humanitarian protection by the federal government, including refugees, people granted asylum and certain survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking.
“We’re talking about folks who have been physical laborers their entire life, and all of a sudden, they’re getting to the stage where their bodies are giving out and they can no longer compete with younger workers,” McKernan said. “We’re talking about folks who have raised their kids or grandkids and now have an empty house and no work history. They may have kids over the age of 14, but they can’t act in that caretaker role and get SNAP.”
What do advocates say?
Advocates worry the changes will mean more families will go hungry.
“When you’ve got a family who are looking at a budget that doesn’t work – their income doesn’t balance with their expenses — they start saying, ‘What can we squeeze?’ Rent is what it is, you have no power to negotiate health insurance premiums, the cost of gas is what it is. One area where families have some flexibility to squeeze a budget down is food,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut.
Some families might lean toward purchasing foods that are calorie-dense to maintain their caloric intake but that aren’t nutrient-dense, health officials said. That can lead to conditions like obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
“When I was working full-time running a shelter for families experiencing homelessness, this is the part of their budget where they were looking to spend as little as possible so they could maximize what they had for rent,” Tepper Bates said. “What that meant was often, for a family with two small kids, they’re buying a 10-pound bag of white rice and five pounds of the cheapest hamburger meat they can find, and that’s going to be the basis of their food for the week. That is simply not adequate nutrition.”
Are there legal challenges?
Attorney General William Tong announced late last month that he and 21 other attorneys general are suing the federal government, seeking to block new guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that deems some immigrants ineligible for food assistance even after they become permanent residents.
In October, the USDA issued new guidance to state agencies describing changes to SNAP eligibility under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Tong said the memo incorrectly asserted that all individuals who entered the country through certain pathways — including refugees, asylum recipients and others — would remain permanently ineligible for SNAP, even after obtaining green cards and becoming lawful permanent residents. The attorneys general argue the guidance contradicts federal law and could impose large financial penalties on states.
“The Trump Administration cannot help themselves. They are messing with SNAP benefits again. This time they are inventing their own rules to permanently ban legal immigrants — green card holders — from ever receiving food stamps,” Tong said in a statement. “There is zero basis in the law for this cruel move, and we’re suing to stop them.”
Will the state step in with funding?
With many poised to lose benefits, advocates are asking elected officials to create a state-funded food assistance program to fill the gap.
Since at least the 1990s, Connecticut had a state-financed food stamp program for legal immigrants who otherwise would have been eligible for the federal program but were excluded by welfare reform legislation in 1996. The legislature in August 2016 directed the state Department of Social Services to stop adding people to the program, though the initiative was funded through 2017, officials with DSS said.
In September, representatives with Greater Hartford Legal Aid, New Haven Legal Assistance and Connecticut Legal Services sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders asking them to, among other things, establish a state-funded food assistance program for previously eligible legal immigrants and others who may lose SNAP benefits.
“We urge you to address the imminent harm to low-income CT residents that cuts to SNAP in H.R. 1 are poised to inflict. Our low-income clients depend on SNAP benefits to feed themselves and their families and depend on information and resources provided by DSS to access those benefits,” six people with those organizations wrote.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, a Democrat from Middletown who is co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said he and his colleagues are interested in exploring a state-funded food assistance program during the legislative session that begins in February. Launching such an initiative would require money and software upgrades to run it, he said.
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, pointed to a $500 million emergency fund authorized during the special session this month as one way to help residents losing access to SNAP. “This is an example of what the fund could be used for,” he said. “Obviously, the governor has a lot of discretion, and we have to vote on it. If the governor were to come to us and say, ‘I’d like to help out these folks who are getting kicked off SNAP,’ I would support that.”
A spokesman for Lamont said the governor is still reviewing how to use money in the emergency fund.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_070-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

(Rich Townsend/Getty Images)New Mexico Department of Health experts on Friday announced an expedited timeline for the state’s new medical psilocybin program during the program’s first advisory board meeting.
The seven members of the newly formed Medical Psilocybin Advisory Board met virtually with DOH experts, state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) and dozens of members of the public to discuss the status of the program and a draft of the program’s operational procedures.
The program was created during the regular legislative session earlier this year through the passage of Senate Bill 219, cosponsored by Steinborn. The bill established the program and advisory board, as well as made the use of psilocybin legal in the state in controlled, qualified medical treatment settings. New Mexico is the third state in the country to allow psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, for therapeutic use.
“We are experiencing a new renaissance…of psychedelic medicine,” Steinborn said during the board meeting. He added that other states will be watching and learning from how New Mexico’s program is established. “By definition, we’re pioneers and we’re going to learn a lot, but I also want to challenge you to not be afraid to try new things, to innovate, to make things better than maybe they’ve been in other states, in some cases.”
Medical Psilocybin Act becomes law in New Mexico, but what’s next?

According to the bill, patients will qualify for the psilocybin program and treatment if they are diagnosed with major treatment-resistance depression; post traumatic stress disorder; substance use disorders; end-of-life care; and other conditions approved of by the DOH. The bill also states that the program must be implemented no later than Dec. 31, 2027.
Dominick Zurlo, director of the Center for Medical Cannabis and Psilocybin, said during the meeting that the DOH has set the goal of opening the program to the public a year early. The department has also hired a program manager and are working to fill the roles of environmental scientist and compliance officer.
“Because there has been such large interest in this and a push for us to try to be able to help people with psilocybin treatments earlier, we have set a goal now to have the program at least to be able to see the initial patients by the end of December of 2026,” Zurlo said. 
During public comment, attendees voiced support and excitement for the program’s creation. Others said they were curious about the possibility of trying the treatment when it becomes available; how the supply chain will work with local mushroom growers; and how licensing will work for medical providers.
Denali Wilson, director of strategic support for the nonprofit Healing Advocacy Fund, said her organization is ready to provide input to the DOH as the program takes shape. She said its priorities are safety, a “clear code of ethics,” systems for measuring outcomes and patient affordability.
“While it is important for the program to move forward with urgency, achieving the right balance of safety, affordability and equity will require careful attention and thoughtfulness,” Wilson said. “Let’s be sure that any acceleration of the regulatory timeline doesn’t unintentionally compromise patient safety, undermine long-term sustainability or limit meaningful public engagement.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RichTownsendGettyImages-mushroomsDec72025purchased-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

She is an English and history teacher at Winooski High School, and 2025 Vermont state teacher of the year.



In my classroom, we do a lot of challenging learning. When given a hard task, we spend time reading multiple sources, asking questions, interviewing stakeholders, listening to diverse perspectives and synthesizing multiple perspectives. 
A good learner revises their thinking when given new information; we will often use sentence frames such as “I used to think… then I learned… now I think” to track our learning.

Recognizing the nuances of an issue is not a failure; it’s a success. When my students recognize complexities of an issue, it’s a win not a failure. 
Our members of the redistricting task force did just this: they listened to community input, reckoned with the complexities of the task, and rather than pushing through with the “assignment,” they bravely proposed an alternative solution. 
And yet, Gov. Phil Scott and his team deemed this a failure, claiming that the task force had given up and failed. Nothing could be further from the truth: when my students understand the complexities of an issue and propose nuanced solutions to difficult problems, that is a win. Why would it not be the same for our state’s leaders? 
If the governor is so annoyed about the direction of the task force, I wonder why his team has not produced any numbers that reflect actual cost savings of consolidation. It became abundantly clear to the task force that a plan to consolidate districts lacks clear financial savings. If the administration disagrees, where are these numbers? 
The courage from the task force members allows us to refocus this upcoming legislative season on the real needs in front of Vermonters and our schools. Rather than debate consolidation maps that do not prove to save money, our legislators can focus the conversation on what our students and schools need. And there are indeed a lot of needs. 
We could use our legislative session to focus on the rising health care costs that strain school budgets. We could address the unsustainable rise in property taxes that are hurting Vermonters statewide. Or, we could discuss how to actually fund the school construction aid that was established in Act 73. 
We could use this new session to focus on putting nurses back in every school building, every day, or art and music teachers in all of our schools daily, or on hiring more social workers and therapists to respond to the ever growing mental health needs of our students. Many school districts passed budgets in 2024 and 2025 that cut many staff positions and are likely preparing for another round of barebones budgets.
We could use our upcoming session to address our statewide teacher shortage and invest time and money in expanding our grow-your-own initiatives and our support for new teachers. 
Or, we could focus our attention back on ensuring that public funds go to public schools that serve all students and follow state guidelines. Rather than provide vouchers for some, we could strengthen our public schools for all. 
There’s a lot of work to be done in our state. Hopefully, the stance of the task force will give other legislators in Montpelier courage to do right for public schools: to listen to teachers, to listen to students and to listen to community members who demand strong public schools.
Our public schools are our bedrock to our democracy; let’s focus on building them up, not tearing them down, this new legislative season.

Dec. 4, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAs Gwynne Wilcox awaits a court ruling to determine if President Donald Trump had the power to remove her from the National Labor Relations Board, the tireless labor advocate returned to Detroit last week with a hero’s reception.
Wilcox was the first Black woman to serve on the board since its inception. She was also the first person to be removed from the board by a sitting president in its 90-year existence. She is now suing the Trump administration over that decision, and the case is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court after a stay was issued by Chief Justice John Roberts. The lower courts have largely rejected Trump’s effort to remove her.
On Thursday, Wilcox headlined Sugar Law Center’s annual “Essential Advocacy: For Economic & Social Justice” dinner and speaker event. The night included an address from Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and was attended by U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit). 
Wilcox also received the firm’s essential advocacy honor. It was a full circle moment for Wilcox, who at one time was a board member to the nonprofit which is dedicated to providing advocacy and support to poor and working people facing societal challenges.
Wilcox said the work of advocates that tell the stories of working people, much like Sugar Law Center, was indeed essential to upholding the nation’s constitutional freedoms – especially in the era of Trump.

“The impact of the decisions made by the administration have really changed the National Labor Relations board’s ability to do the work that it’s doing,” Wilcox said. “So needless to say … the work that you all are doing is so, so important. We don’t know what’s going to happen with the National Labor Relations Board, but you have been surviving for so many, many years, doing excellent work. Workers need you. Our communities need you. Their families need you to continue doing the work.”
For Wilcox, it was just another feather in her cap after a long distinguished career of fighting for worker’s rights. Prior to her appointment to the National Labor Relations Board, Wilcox was a senior partner at the Levy Ratner law firm in New York, serving as the associate general counsel for  SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, and a labor representative to the New York City Office of Collective Bargaining. 
She’s also been a board member for various labor advocacy and legal groups, including the AFL-CIO Lawyers Coordinating Committee, now known as the Union Lawyers Alliance.
John Philo, the executive and legal director of the Sugar Law Center, told Michigan Advance that honoring Wilcox as she continues her fight against the Trump administration meant a great deal to the organization.










The president cannot remove someone who has not been alleged to have engaged in any type of negligence nor any type of cause. They never pretended to even allege that there was any cause.

“It’s the living struggle that’s happening right now between those who believe in rule of law and those who believe strictly in power. And she is at the pivot point of that,” Philo said. “What’s happened to her through the actions of the president really is going to define our country. Do we believe in the rule of law, and do we believe that the president is restrained by a Constitution? Or are we going in a much different and much dangerous direction?”

Wilcox was nominated by former President Joe Biden and served a first term on the National Labor Relations Board from August 2021 until August 2023. She served as the board’s chair after she was renominated by Biden in 2023, until she was ultimately removed by Trump shortly after he returned to office in January of this year.
Her term was meant to go through 2028. Wilcox was one of two board members dismissed by Trump this year, as Jennifer Abruzzo was also removed from the powerful labor board. The firings essentially nullified the three-person board because it now lacks a quorum to decide labor cases that have come before it over the last century.
Wilcox sued the Trump administration and the board’s new chair, Marvin Kaplan, in February, filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell of the District of Columbia ruled in March that Trump had violated the National Labor Relations Act, and ordered that Wilcox would remain a member.
A three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel overturned that decision, but when the appellate court heard the matter again en banc, which means before the entire U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit bench, the court ruled 7-4 to block Wilcox’s termination.
The matter is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court on a stay issued by Roberts.
Wilcox discussed her struggle against Trump and the difficulties therein while speaking to a rapt crowd at the Sugar Law Center event.
“I knew that I had to fight because the board, both the statute and the Supreme Court have said, they’re an independent agency,” Wilcox said. “The board is supposed to exist, and the president cannot remove someone who has not been alleged to have engaged in any type of negligence nor any type of cause. They never pretended to even allege that there was any cause.”
Wilcox said that the Trump administration’s firing of her and Abruzzo exposed that the administration didn’t really fully understand the board’s role or what the members of the board did.
“Sometimes I was called commissioner, sometimes she was considered a board member, but (the letter said) she made decisions,” Wilcox said. “It was poorly written.”

In all, Wilcox said the lawsuit wasn’t about trying to get her job back – it was about the important fight for the autonomy of a key independent federal agency.
“(The board) has been in existence since 1935, and it protects the rights of workers,” she said. “It’s not a neutral statute, the statute that’s there to protect workers. And so I felt very clear about that. … I believe in the rule of law.”
Although the ultimate decision over Trump’s authority rests with a U.S. Supreme Court majority that has shown a willingness to appease the president’s legal overreaches, Wilcox said the work that advocates like Sugar Law Center and others do to uplift the stories of workers was paramount to the cause and maintaining American freedoms.
Philo echoed the same sentiment, and called Wilcox a shining example of that effort.
“We will fight. We will fight it now. We’ll fight it tomorrow, and we’ll fight it the day after tomorrow. We may lose a few of those battles, but we’re not going back to a country that doesn’t have a Constitution, a country that doesn’t believe in equality or the rule of law,” Philo said. “We may lose battles, but we’re not going to lose this at the end of the day. (The American people) are a decent people, and they are going to embrace our Constitution, embrace democracy, embrace, really, equality for everybody.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC046413-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)About a quarter of Indiana Republican senators have not yet said how they’ll vote on a sweeping partisan redraw of the state’s congressional maps, teeing up an uncertain week for the proposal’s future.
The Senate will reconvene Monday afternoon to begin consideration of House Bill 1032, after reversing an earlier decision not to meet.
The redesign would likely eliminate Indiana’s two Democratic-held congressional districts to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm election, as sought by President Donald Trump.
The House approved the redistricting bill Friday, as expected, on a vote of 57-41. Twelve Republicans joined all Democrats present in opposition.
But Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has warned there are “not enough votes to move that idea forward.” He didn’t return multiple interview requests on how the proposal’s prospects may have changed in recent weeks.
Indiana’s Constitution requires a majority of the 50-member Senate to approve legislation. That means the 40-strong Republican supermajority must muster at least 26 votes to pass the bill if all 10 Democrats oppose. GOP Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith can break a 25-25 tie.
Indiana House approves redistricting bill, sending issue to state Senate

Sixteen Senate Republicans have publicly come out in favor of a redraw — some more enthusiastically than others. Another 14 are against.
The latest senator to indicate firm opposition is Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield.
“I think the maps are pretty alarming, actually. So I was a no before, and I’m for sure a no now,” he told the Capital Chronicle. “I mean, I just think that if those maps pass, there’s a good possibility that three or four millionaires from Indianapolis will represent a third of the state, so I don’t know that that serves us well.”
In the current congressional maps, drawn in 2021, Republicans maintained a 7-2 GOP advantage. Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan holds the 1st District in northwest Indiana, while Democratic Rep. André Carson holds the 7th District in Indianapolis.
The House Republican proposal would break up the Lake Michigan shoreline area into two districts and splinter Indianapolis across four far-reaching districts — three of which hit borders with other states.
“I can tell you, from experience, it’s kind of difficult to have totally urban areas and totally rural areas where the constituents are thinking and talking about completely different things,” Crider said.
“For instance, in Hancock County and Shelby County, they never talked about mass transit, and that’s what they wanted to talk about in Irvington. And so, I mean, it’s a stretch,” he said. “And then, if you take that stretch and magnify it from, you know, the south side of Indianapolis to the Ohio River, I’m not sure how that’s even workable. I guess I don’t know how you come up with the map that does that.”
The positions of 10 others remain unknown, even though the first Senate-side votes could be cast as early as Monday afternoon.
That’s when the Elections Committee is scheduled to hear the proposal — and from constituents.
Committee math
Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, promised to “foster a civil debate as we review this bill,” in a Friday statement. He chairs the nine-member committee and is the Senate sponsor of the House-originated legislation.
Gaskill, plus GOP Sens. Tyler Johnson of Leo and Daryl Schmitt of Jasper, support redistricting. But fellow Sen. Greg Walker of Columbus, who isn’t running for reelection, has come out against the idea.
Two committee Democrats are expected to vote in opposition, while three other Republicans are undecided or have declined to comment.
Story continues below.

Sen. Linda Rogers, R-LaGrange, said she’s “going back and forth, listening to constituents” throughout “lots of” phone calls and emails, as well as testimony from the House’s single public hearing last week.
“I will be in the elections committee, so until I at least hear all the testimony I don’t like to have made my decision,” Rogers told the Capital Chronicle. She noted “there are so many ramifications on both sides.”
Sen. Greg Goode, R-Terre Haute, previously said he wanted to see the maps — which have since been released — before making a decision. Goode didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment on his stance.
Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, said, “I don’t have any comment for you at this time,” when reached by phone Wednesday.
If the redistricting bill advances from first reading in committee, it would head to the chamber floor for amendments on Wednesday. After it’s engrossed, the proposal would go up for a full Senate vote on Thursday.
‘Whatever happens, happens’
It’s unclear how the bill will fare outside the committee room, too.
Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said Wednesday that he had seen the maps but hadn’t yet read the details of the bill: “You’re not going to get me to commit to something that I haven’t read.”
But, he noted, the legislation goes beyond redrawing boundaries.
“I understand there’s, you know, dates in there and all the things of, you know, people can’t sue. I mean, there’s all kinds of things in there that are unrelated to a map that I have to review,” said Freeman, who is also an attorney. “So I’ll do so, and I’ll be ready to go.”
House Bill 1032 would prohibit seeking or granting temporary injunctions against it, and gives the Indiana Supreme Court “exclusive” jurisdiction over any appeal of an order promoting an injunction.
“That part, in particular, might be a little flag for them in terms of how (unsure senators) view this,” said Laura Merrifield Wilson, a political science professor at the University of Indianapolis.

Sen. Brian Buchanan — who spoke to the Capital Chronicle during a brief dally on the sidelines of a pro-redistricting rally at the Statehouse on Friday — declined to comment on his stance or announcement timeline.
Others didn’t reply to requests for comment, including:

Republican Sens. Dan Dernulc of Highland and Rick Niemeyer of Lowell told the Capital Chronicle last month, during the ceremonial first day of the legislative session, that they wanted to see the maps before deciding. It’s unclear what they think of the released draft.
Sen. Cyndi Carrasco, R-Indianapolis, said last month that she’d made a decision. When asked to share it, she replied, “Maybe later.”
Sens. Ed Charbonneau of Valparaiso and Ryan Mishler of Fishers have been publicly noncommittal.

“We also, to my knowledge, have not heard more statements from some of the ‘question-mark’ senators,” Wilson, the professor, observed.
“I kind of wonder if … there’s been movement that we don’t know,” she said, like if senators are “not being forthright with the information of whether or not they have changed or made a decision.”
Wilson said that silence could set up a shock result, if “enough people silently vote in support, having never gone on the record … before.”
Or, it could go the other way. When asked Friday what’s next if the Senate rejects the redistricting bill, Huston told reporters: “Look, it’s been a long week. We’ll deal with it. Whatever happens, happens.”
Cranking up the pressure
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, who appeared at the pro-redistricting rally on Friday, was more aggressive. He again threatened to support primary competition for fellow Republicans who oppose redistricting.
The bill’s failure in the Senate, he said, “means you’re gonna have to clean house to get real conservatives in.”
Braun first echoed Trump’s primary ultimatum last month, after the president posted that Braun “perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes” — and later, that he “must produce” on redistricting.

Rally attendees were repeatedly encouraged to contact their senators — including at stations upstairs by the Senate’s Republican and Democratic entrances. Constituents could leave handwritten messages there.
“I’m down here to break the one-party rule in Marion County,” said Lawrence Township resident Adam Harvey. “Currently, André Carson’s my congressman, and he doesn’t represent me at all.”
The rally drew a crowd of a couple hundred. Some traveled from further afield.
“The state is 60% Republican. We’ve got 80% of the House and the Senate. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t do this,” said Robert Hall, who drove about 90 miles from Mitchell.
Some redistricting opponents argue all-GOP congressional representation isn’t fair when Indiana has typically voted for Trump and others on a 60-40 split. But, Hall said, “What if each of those nine districts were 60-40? That’s what the state is.”
He, like numerous others, cited partisan redistricting efforts in Democratic-controlled states.
The pro-redistricting rally came days after hundreds of Hoosiers packed the Statehouse’s third floor to protest the redistricting plan. Their chants echoed throughout the building, audible even through the doors into the House chamber, as lawmakers plodded through proceedings.
Linda Butler of Lawrence in northeastern Marion County was among the protesters.
“They’re doing it so that they can win elections,” Butler said then, about Indiana Republicans. “It is terrible. I think it’s terrible. That’s an illustration for me that this is wrong.”
State police adjust Statehouse security
At least a dozen legislators, largely Senate Republicans, have publicly disclosed being targeted in swatting attempts, bomb threats and more — prompting an ongoing investigation now led by the Indiana State Police.
That number doesn’t include similar incidents involving local officials, such as Indianapolis City-County Councilor Nick Roberts, according to ISP spokesman Ron Galaviz.
The threats have varied but appear to share a common aim: triggering significant law enforcement responses.
In mid-November, GOP Sen. Andy Zay reported that a bomb threat was emailed to his family’s Huntington vehicle rental business, prompting officers to temporarily block off the area while they investigated.
The threat came shortly after a procedural vote on when the Senate would reconvene. Zay had voted to keep the chamber in session instead of returning in January, which was widely interpreted as support for coming back and addressing redistricting sooner.
“At this point, I’m voting for it,” he told the Capital Chronicle on Wednesday. But, he said, “I would like to see the maps change. … I’m hoping we can make them better” in the Senate.

Asked what edits he’d like to make, Zay quipped, “We don’t have enough time on this phone call.” He said the maps “changed a lot more dramatically than I thought they would.”
Several other lawmakers have also disclosed fake reports had been made to police about violent incidents at their homes — including what officials described as attempts at “swatting.”
Swatting typically involves someone falsely reporting an emergency, such as a shooting or hostage situation, in an effort to prompt an armed law enforcement response to an unsuspecting person’s home.
Although some incidents prompted only small responses — “maybe about a handful of officers,” Galaviz said of the first Terre Haute call to Goode’s residence — officials have stressed that the intent behind the calls appears consistent with swatting.
Galaviz said none of the recent episodes resulted in what police would consider a “large police response.” He emphasized that local agencies “are responding seriously,” while also taking “an extra moment of pause” because they know similar hoaxes are occurring across the state.
State police are routing all reports through the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center as part of one overarching investigation.
Galaviz said ISP has not made any arrests and declined to discuss investigative specifics. But the work “can take some time.”
The “volume of reports” and the high-profile nature of the alleged targets require “thorough, accurate, deep-diving investigations” that could ultimately result in state or federal prosecutions, per Galaviz.
Security protocols at the Statehouse have been adjusted, too, although Galaviz declined to provide details. He said ISP is “well aware” of the ongoing threats and has updated plans ahead of lawmakers’ return to Indianapolis. Local law enforcement agencies may also have their own protective measures in place for targeted officials.
Galaviz urged the public to continue sending any relevant information to the Fusion Center and said ISP will release updates — particularly if an arrest is made — but won’t disclose details prematurely.
“We’re not going to jeopardize our case just because one of your subscribers wants to know,” he said. “It’ll come out sooner or later. We just want it to come out at the appropriate time.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)California in September became the first state to ban law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, in response to immigration raids where federal agents wore masks. 
The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state over the prohibition last month.
Democratic lawmakers here in Washington are now planning similar legislation.
Washington’s proposal, spearheaded by Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, and Rep. Julio Cortes, D-Everett, resembles California’s law. 
The Trump administration says the California policy jeopardizes the safety of federal officers, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and is unconstitutional because it tries to regulate federal activities.
Legislators in other states, including Virginia, Illinois and Michigan, have proposed similar restrictions. Connecticut has prohibited authorities from wearing face coverings inside state courthouses, with limited exceptions.
Cortes hopes the legislation would build community trust in law enforcement and hold police accountable. 
“Trust is essential for crime reporting. When folks trust their local law enforcement, they are going to be reporting more crime,” he said Thursday. “When we see ICE out there, when those masked agents are out in communities, they create fear and intimidation, and that discourages community members from interacting with any law enforcement, even when they need help themselves.”
Cortes sees the proposed policy as consistent with existing state law requiring officers to be “reasonably identifiable,” meaning that their uniform displays their name and other information.
The bill would have some exemptions, like for undercover operations, or if officers need to wear protective gear such as gas masks or motorcycle helmets.
In an April raid at a Bellingham roofing company, dozens of ICE agents donned masks when they arrested 37 workers accused of being in the country without legal status.
Steve Strachan, executive director for the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, declined to comment on the substance of the bill, but said he’s had a “very productive” discussion about it with Cortes and Valdez. 
“We remain hopeful that these conversations will be ongoing and result with a proposal that we can all support,” Strachan said in a statement. 
Valdez said it’s fair to say that law enforcement is “not excited about the bill.”
The Legislature convenes in January for a 60-day session. Both the House and Senate will need to pass the bill before it can get to the governor’s desk.
The potential legal battle that could ensue if the bill becomes law doesn’t discourage Cortes. 
“That’s maybe a bridge that we’ll cross when we get there,” he said, adding that the focus now is to make “our community understand that we are here with them, and we are here to support them, and we are here to keep them safe.”
Attorney General Nick Brown said his office is monitoring the bill. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The bill will make clear that if the courts nullify California’s law, then Washington’s law, if passed, would remain on the books, but only apply to state and local law enforcement, not federal, Valdez said.
Congressional Democrats have filed bills focused on federal agents, including ICE, but the measures have little chance of success in the Republican-controlled Congress.
Next year, Washington state lawmakers will also consider a bill championed by Brown to protect immigrant workers. The Immigrant Worker Protection Act would require employers to notify their employees of a planned inspection of employment eligibility paperwork within 72 hours of being notified about it by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/immigration-agents-portland-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)When a Colorado woman was accused of being a porch pirate, police were certain they had the right person. After all, it was caught on camera — specifically, on automatic license plate readers. She found herself having to painstakingly comb through her life to demonstrate that she couldn’t have been the one who committed the crime — she wasn’t even in the area at the time. After police dropped the charges, she told a news station, “It became my job to prove my innocence. And I thought it was supposed to be the other way around.”
She is, of course, correct. In fact, she articulated a core principle of the American justice system: we are innocent until proven guilty. Because of this, the government should not invade our privacy just in case we do something illegal. But law enforcement agencies are increasingly using license plate readers for mass location tracking and surveillance of everyone — not just those suspected of a crime. 
Indiana lawmakers want to crack down on data privacy. What about license plate readers?

A retired veteran in Virginia filed a lawsuit to find out just how often the readers were tracking him. The result? They logged his location 526 times in just over four months — about four times every single day. 
In most areas of the country, including Indiana, the data collected by the readers can be stored indefinitely with few, if any, meaningful privacy protections. Think of the implications. These records could be used to reveal incredibly personal and sensitive information: whether a person attended an AA meeting, a political rally, a church service, the office of a physician who specializes in a specific type of disease — the list is never-ending. 
This isn’t mere speculation. In fact, there have already been numerous instances across the country of abuse – including cases where members of law enforcement used the systems to track the whereabouts of estranged partners and exes. While the vast majority of officers would never misuse a tool like this, even a single violation of someone’s privacy is unacceptable and undermines public trust. 
The privacy concerns around license plate readers don’t stop at city or county lines. Some systems, like Flock, are used across the country and around the world. This means law enforcement in other states, and even countries, can access Hoosiers’ data, turning a supposedly local safety tool into potential cross-border surveillance that people never agreed to and can’t reasonably opt out of. 
Indiana lawmakers should institute reasonable guardrails on the use of the technology. This includes requiring that the records of people who are not suspected of any crime be deleted within a short period — days or weeks at most. Regulations should also ensure that law enforcement agencies can’t use databases from private companies that have inadequate privacy policies.  
License plate readers can be a helpful tool when used for narrowly tailored purposes, such as toll enforcement or identifying vehicles that are stolen or involved in a serious crime. But lawmakers must balance the use of this technology with the privacy rights of Hoosiers. If you wouldn’t be ok with the government installing GPS on your car to track your every move, you shouldn’t be ok with the unregulated use of these readers either.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2157492329-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

Biking from Springfield to Mountain Home, Arkansas, where he’d planned to stay with a friend, Chiasson, 52, was pulled over and arrested on a warrant for a stolen car — charges that were eventually dropped.
While fighting the charges, Chiasson said, he got into a cycle of “using, stressing,” failing drug tests at his court appearances and then “hav[ing] to go do seven days in jail.” 
He was in jail when another inmate told him about the Action Recovery Center, a Christian sober living house in Gainesville. The residential program promised to help residents with substance use disorders find stability through faith, work and peer support.
Chiasson became one of about 20 Missourians who have graduated from Action Recovery Center’s nine-month program since it opened in November 2023. It’s one of a spate of faith-based sober living houses established by Christians in recovery from substance use disorders in Wright, Ozark, Douglas and Texas counties.
Jerry Chiasson reflects on his time as a resident and mentor at Action Recovery Center in Gainesville (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
They’ve emerged outside Missouri’s regulatory structures for recovery houses in a part of the state where treatment and services for people battling substance use disorders are scarce. There are 3,677 accredited beds in the state, and 44% of them are located in St. Louis or Kansas City. There are no accredited beds in Ozark County, where Action Recovery Center is located.
While these unaccredited recovery houses meet a need in communities where treatment options are limited or nonexistent, they raise concerns that a lack of any oversight could hinder their effectiveness or lead to abuse.
“These things are popping up all over,” said Judge Craig Carter, presiding judge in the 44th circuit, which spans Ozark, Wright and Douglas counties. “And they give a lot of people who otherwise could not get it, they give them a second chance.”
Carter said that while he has a working relationship with recovery houses like Action Recovery Center and Mountain Moving Ministry in Wright County, he doesn’t always know what to expect from new houses farther afield.
“If I send someone all the way down to Butler County, I need to know that they’re going to communicate with me and that they’re above board,” Carter said.

Recovery houses in Missouri are not required to undergo any certification process to open their doors. But in order to receive state or federal funding disbursed by the Missouri Department of Mental Health, they must be accredited by the Missouri Coalition of Recovery Support Providers. 
The coalition accredits recovery houses using standards established by the National Alliance of Recovery Residences. The standards cover residents’ rights, building safety and the houses’ relationship with neighbors, and after initial accreditation, the coalition visits houses every two years to ensure they still meet all requirements.
Merna Eppick, director of the coalition’s housing committee, said the aim of accreditation is to strengthen support for residents of these recovery houses.
“We try hard to help you become better,” Eppick said. “Our goal is, even if you’ve got 20 deficiencies, you’ve got 90 days to fix it. We revisit it and say, ‘Yay, you did a great job. You’re accredited.’ We want to help all of us be better.” 
But Action Recovery Center — and a handful of other recovery houses in southern Missouri — are not seeking accreditation. 
Ken Polm, founder of Big Boy Men’s Ministry in Cabool, said he doesn’t pursue state funding because he is concerned the money would come with requirements that could sideline residents’ spiritual development.
“If we receive state funding,” Polm said, “a lot of times, we’re not allowed to make it all about Christ. We get limited to what we can actually do, as far as the type of classes.”
For Polm, the biggest issue with accreditation relates to medication-assisted treatment. He and other leaders of faith-based sober living homes told The Independent that they worry taking medications like methadone or buprenorphine to beat an opioid addiction sets people up to relapse.
Decades of research have shown that methadone and buprenorphine taken as “maintenance” medications, for months or years, sharply reduce overdose deaths by 50 to 70%.
Recovery houses don’t have to accept medication-assisted treatment to be accredited or receive state funding. But they do if they want any federal funds through the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
 To fish for a man

On a Tuesday evening in late October, 15 to 20 men spill from the living room to the kitchen of an old house in Cabool, with a couple of people poring over Bibles in an adjoining room. 
It’s one of two homes to Big Boy Men’s Ministry. 
There are at least four bedrooms filled with the stuff of the men’s lives: family photos taped to the wall, backpacks, laundry hampers clustered around bunk beds set up dorm-style. Polm is rushing to get to a revival, and he’s trying to round up residents who want to come. Others stay to socialize, with hugs and gentle ribbing among men who have become brothers.
Polm said he began his ministry to men struggling with addiction while he was on probation. He’d strike up conversations when he reported to the probation office.
Chiasson wrote the mission statement for Action Recovery House after becoming house leader. “Those words just poured out of my heart,” he said  (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
“Just through conversation, you could tell that they were trying to have a new life, but they didn’t know how to have it,” Polm said. “So I would basically start there. Then after that, even when it wasn’t my visit to see the probation officer, I would still attend the office, just to go in there and sit and fish for a man.”
Polm said he and his wife, April, were “blessed…with a very big house.” So they started welcoming men to live in their 3,200-square-foot basement. Big Boy Men’s Ministry now spans two houses, and April started a recovery housing ministry for women called Abundant Grace.
“Me and my wife, we really enjoy it,” Polm said. “Because downstairs, when the guys are down there and they’re being rowdy, laughing and just carrying on with each other, being brothers with one another…being able to be partakers of that experience is so rewarding.”
The men work during the day and attend evening classes four to five times a week. Saturday is laundry and shopping day, Polm said, and from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., they volunteer in the community, building decks, repairing roofs, washing windows, cleaning gutters, “just all kinds of stuff.”
Once a month, the men hold “street church” and share their testimony with the public.
“Either myself or the other men from the ministry that’s been raised up from discipleship to be preachers, they get to be up there preaching the word of God, and we do altar calls,” Polm said. “So we’re very involved on the weekends in our community.”
The men pay $150 per week after their first two weeks, and the ministry accepts donations. 
In late October, there were around 20 men in each of the Polms’ houses. Polm said 50 to 60 men graduate from the ministry each year, and that he and his wife counsel residents like parents. 
“I sit them down as men, and I have these hard talks with them like a father would give them, and I give them the best advice that I can come up with,” he said. “And my wife does the same thing. It’s pretty fascinating and such a joy to experience this, that some of the men will even come to my wife and say, ‘Hey Mom, can we talk?’ They’re having wife problems, or they’re having children problems.”
Dayton Austin, 28, of West Plains, said Polm has been talking to him “man to man” since the first time he got in trouble in 2019, even when he slipped up.
He did his first recovery housing program at Mountain Moving Ministry in Mountain Grove, Austin said, where Polm is board president. 
He graduated from the program and “made all the right moves, did all the right hoops, said all the right words,” but got another charge within six months.
Austin kept graduating from recovery housing programs and getting in trouble, he said, selling fentanyl and “just being crazy.” He had periods of success, too, studying for a few years to be an occupational therapy assistant in Springfield.
“I was doing the thing, without people having to tell me what to do,” Austin said.
Dayton Austin looks to the future in the kitchen of Big Boy Men’s Ministry in Cabool (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
He loved his studies, he said, but they were stressful and he returned to old patterns. He got caught with meth and a gun. 
Polm told him to just show up at Big Boy Men’s Ministry.
“I had a feeling I was destined for prison,” Austin said, “but I knew I needed to be here before I went.” 
Five months into his stay, Austin was sent to prison for eight months. But, he said, “I had a foundation to go to prison on now.” 
After his release this year, Austin returned to Cabool.
He looks up to the ministry’s growing group of graduates. Some of them have become part of the ministry’s leadership.
“All these guys are on the board now, that God’s really using,” Austin said. “He gave them businesses. They’re busting with kids. They’re busting with families. … They’re creating their own ministries.”
Austin, who is now a certified nursing assistant, said he hopes for a family of his own someday. 
“It’s all a process,” he said, “but I know what I want.”
 Grassroots standards

It’s a busy November morning at the Wright County Courthouse in Hartville, with almost 70 people on the criminal docket.
Chris Turner, 48, of West Plains, is the first to be called before the judge. 
Turner, who was found guilty of burglary and meth possession in April, was called to court for a probation violation hearing because she hadn’t been making her restitution payments. But she was able to satisfy Judge Craig Carter that she’s making progress.
She’s settled up with the county. And in June she moved into a Christian sober living house in West Plains called Design Your Life.
The women’s recovery house was established in September 2024. Carter said he had never heard of it.
“I can honestly say it’s the best thing that’s happened to me since I got in trouble,” Turner told The Independent.
Before she joined Design Your Life, Turner said she was facing homelessness and struggling to find transportation to her drug tests. She said she used to walk the 43 miles from West Plains to Mountain Grove. 
Now she gets transportation to court and her job at a sawmill from Design Your Life. And living in a house full of women is coaxing her out of her shell, she said.
Carter said he is a strong supporter of Christian sober living houses.
But he said there’s a need for shared expectations between sober living houses and the courts when completion of a recovery housing program is a condition of a defendant’s bond or probation. He said communication and fair, consistent drug testing are two of the most important areas for agreement.
Judges can’t unilaterally force a defendant to participate in a religious program, Carter said. But if a defendant applies to a Christian sober living house and is accepted, it can help make the case against keeping them in jail or sending them to prison.
“We’ve sent people to some of the ones in Springfield,” Carter said, “and guys will run, and they won’t let us know. We’ll have them back on the docket in two months. Where is this person?”
Autumn Dulaney, 42, of Isabella, outside of Action Recovery Center in Gainesville. Since finishing the program last year, she and her husband have saved enough money to move out of their camper into a house, and she’s mending her relationships with her children. “I couldn’t have done it without Jesus,” she said (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
Wright County Prosecutor John Tyrrell said he is concerned a lack of standardization can allow abuse of residents.
He gave the example of Compassion House in Niangua. The facility’s founder, Isaac Tilden, was charged this year with child abuse and forced labor. The complaints allege that Tilden compelled residents to work for free or face revocation of probation or parole, and that he failed to protect his daughter from sexual abuse by residents.
Accreditation provides standards and protections for recovery house residents, but accredited recovery beds are scarce in some parts of the state.
Shawn Wilkerson, who is spearheading plans to expand Mountain Moving Ministry to Ava, said he and a friend spent 10 hours trying to find a spot for him in treatment when he embarked on his recovery journey five years ago.
“The guy said, ‘Well, it going to be a year,” Wilkerson said. “I said, ‘Well, in a year I’ll either be in prison or dead.”
Howell County, where Turner and Austin are from, has only 18 of the state’s 3,677 accredited recovery beds. Texas County, where Polm runs his two recovery houses, has one accredited house with 22 beds.
Springfield and Branson have a combined 641 beds, but each is over an hour away from Gainesville or Mountain Grove. And transportation is a challenge in this rural part of the state.
Sober living houses typically transport residents to and from work and court.
“Twenty guys in a house, and they all have different court dates,” Carter said. “And in different counties…. They just drive the tires off.”
Tyrrell said he’s leery of state oversight but suggested that judges, prosecutors and attorneys gather on a circuit level to set expectations for recovery houses.
“I need to know that the programs understand that these are court orders, and court orders have to be complied with,” Tyrrell said.
Wilkerson said leaders of the residences and the courts should work locally to share best practices.
“We need to build — and I think this is where we’re at working on it — building a baseline portfolio to where I could sit down with a prosecutor in Greene County, open up a portfolio and say, ‘This is what we do, why we do it, how we do it,” Wilkerson said.
Tyrrell said the recovery houses the court works with often share information that helps him make decisions about defendants’ cases. 
“I can go talk to the director,” Tyrrell said, “and say, ‘Hey, tell me about this person. What’s he like? Is there something I need to know?’ And they’ll be honest with you. That helps.”
Jayson Jackson, 27, said he was about to be sent to prison for 10 years after absconding from probation when he told the prosecuting attorney on his case that he was going to Big Boy Men’s Ministry. Because the prosecutor and judge were familiar with Polm’s recovery house, they agreed to give him a chance.
“I go, ‘God sent me a piece of paper telling me I’m going to Big Boy,” Jackson said. “So unless you [or that judge] have got more authority than God, I know I’m not [going to prison].”

Jackson said he had been trying to break into an abandoned house in Willow Springs while on the lam when he encountered God. He had fallen to his knees on the side of a road and prayed. Then, he said, a piece of paper hit him in the face. 
It was an advertisement for a new sandwich from Dairy Queen, Jackson said. On the other side, someone had written down Polm’s phone number.
Jackson said he’s been sober for 3 years. Now he travels around the state with Polm, preaching, and he works at a sawmill.
“I throw logs for a living,” Jackson said. “They come in, roll them down the log deck, chop them all up and I stack them.”
Jackson said the hard work has been worth it.
“It’s cold, and it’s wet,” he said. “But I wouldn’t trade the life that I live right now for the whole world.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3273-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos’ conduct has prompted two formal ethics complaints. One advocate called her behavior “unacceptable and deeply concerning.”
Read the story on VTDigger here:  These Vermont sexual assault survivors sought justice. Instead, one victim said the prosecutor’s approach was “like a ‘screw you’”.","A Bristol small business owner said she hoped she and her 15-year-old daughter would be treated respectfully when they pursued a criminal complaint against the teenager who sexually assaulted her daughter. 
Instead, the business owner says she was sworn at by Eva Vekos, the embattled state’s attorney in Addison County. State’s attorneys are elected in every county in Vermont to lead the office that works with police and sheriffs departments to prosecute cases in court. 
“Her general attitude toward victims is so derogatory,” the business owner said of Vekos. She filed a formal ethics complaint against Vekos, whose troubles have piled up since she was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol nearly two years ago. 
Because of how the business owner and three other crime victims say Vekos handled their cases, they felt invalidated, belittled and demeaned. In three of these cases, the victims said Vekos denied them the opportunity to give meaningful input on plea deals she was negotiating with the defense on the sentences their offenders would face. It was “kind of like a ‘screw you’ situation,” said a college student from Vermont who was a victim in a sexual assault case. 
Martha Bowdish, a victim advocate at Addison County Unit for Special Investigations, which investigates sex crimes, has also filed a formal ethics complaint about Vekos with the state Professional Responsibility Board, which handles allegations of attorney misconduct.
The board of Atria Collective, a Middlebury organization that worked closely with Vekos’ office, also raised concern, saying, in a statement to media, that staff has witnessed “countless instances” of victims’ rights being violated during Vekos’ time in office.
“In case after case, our agency has observed, State’s Attorney Vekos neglecting to prioritize both the safety of victims and survivors and the well-being of the community,” Atria Collective’s board of directors wrote.

Vekos’ tumultuous relationship with victims and their advocates came to light after she was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol when she allegedly appeared intoxicated at a suspicious death investigation in January 2024. 
The state investigated a medical leave she took soon after the DUI charge. Then it temporarily suspended her law license. A judge declined to throw out her case. In the fall, her attorney pushed for a deal that could allow the charge to be cleared from her record. Her next court date is set for Dec. 16. 
In spring 2024, lawmakers called for her resignation, but Vekos never stepped down. She is up for re-election in November of 2026.
Vekos declined multiple requests for an interview to discuss the complaints outlined in this story. She responded to some questions via email but declined to discuss others, saying she is constrained by privacy laws.

“I stand by the work done in every case handled by my office,” she wrote. 
“There is no State’s Attorney in Vermont—or prosecutor anywhere—who has been able to fulfill the wishes of every crime victim, ” she wrote, adding that prosecutors must weigh other factors like the strength of evidence and available resources. 
To be sure, prosecutors routinely weigh their chances of winning a conviction as they consider making plea deals. But victims and advocates who criticized Vekos argue she did not meaningfully consult with victims before agreeing to a case’s resolution and that she treated them egregiously. Two victims said the outcomes of their cases led them to fear for public safety. 
Vermont law states that crime victims “shall be treated with courtesy and sensitivity” by courts and prosecutors. To ensure victims receive support, state law also guarantees crime victims the right to a victim advocate, someone trained to walk victims through court processes.
Victims rights were adopted by Vermont and many other states in the 1980s in response to complaints from victims that they were left behind in overburdened criminal justice systems. The goal was to better support victims and create avenues for their voices to be heard in the legal system. 
Victim advocates are state employees who work in every county’s state’s attorneys office. In Vermont, they often handle about 600 cases each, about double the number recommended by a study often cited by state officials. In Addison County, staff from other organizations, including Bowdish and Jena Santa Maria, who directs advocacy for Atria Collective, have stepped in to help.
VTDigger has decided not to name these sexual assault victims or their families, and does not identify sexual assault victims without their consent. VTDigger also interviewed two people who work closely with Vekos’ office who spoke on the condition their names not be used in this story for fear of retaliation. 
‘She had a vendetta’ 
The Bristol small business owner helped her teenage daughter contact police in 2017 after she was sexually assaulted by a teenage boy who was also under the age of 16.

After police found probable cause, a deputy state’s attorney at the time, Rebecca Otey, filed charges against the teenager who assaulted the business owner’s daughter. He faced up to a life sentence, court documents show. 
He pleaded guilty to the charge in 2018 and avoided serving time in prison on the condition he take part in a program for youthful offenders, court documents show. 
He could remain in the youthful offender program if he made a “good faith effort at treatment” and did not commit a crime of violence, his plea agreement said. 
But court records show he lost his placement in the youthful offender program and was eventually arrested in 2023. By this time, he was a 21-year-old man. Juvenile court records, detailing his time in the program, are confidential. 
Vekos was now serving as Addison County’s state’s attorney. After spending most of her career as a defense attorney, often representing juveniles, she was elected to be the county’s top prosecutor in 2022. 
Vermont law gives crime victims the right to get timely notifications of their offender’s release. But in 2023, the man who sexually assaulted the business owner’s daughter was released from jail, court records show. Vekos did not give the business owner any notice, according to the business owner and a person who works closely with cases in Vekos’ office. 
The business owner, in a private meeting with the state’s attorney, said she told Vekos she had violated her daughter’s rights. According to the business owner, Vekos responded, “This is fucking ridiculous. I don’t have time for this.” 
“That’s pretty much set the whole tone for that meeting, where she was just using profanity right and left,” the business owner said. “She was just so condescending and so arrogant,” she added later on. 
The business owner went on to report the profanities when she filed an ethics complaint against Vekos in 2024 with the state board that handles allegations of attorney misconduct. She shared that complaint with VTDigger.
After that meeting, things changed for her daughter’s case. “From that day on she didn’t like that I had called her out and she was gonna do everything she could to make sure that he wasn’t prosecuted,” the business owner said. 
“I would go that far, to say that she had a vendetta and like she was going to prove to me that she could do what she wanted and screw the victims,” the business owner said. 
“Vekos believes she is above the law,” the business owner wrote in her ethics complaint. 
Vekos didn’t address this claim directly when asked to respond to a list of complaints. 
In February, Vekos agreed to give a six-year deferred sentence to the man convicted for his original sexual assault charge from 2017, court documents show. If he followed his conditions of probation for those years, he would then have a clean record. 
The business owner said she considered that possibility “very very dangerous.”
The business owner wrote in her ethics complaint that Vekos violated her and her daughter’s rights by entering into the deferred sentence agreement with the defense before consulting her. A person who works closely with the cases in Vekos’ office confirmed that the business owner and her daughter were not consulted. 
In conversations with the business owner, Vekos did not know basic facts about the case and admitted she did not have time to read the entire file, the business owner wrote in her ethics complaint. The complaint is still pending before the state’s attorney misconduct board. 
A few months later, this June, the man was cited for violating his probation conditions by moving to a different part of the state, according to court documents. Typically, when someone convicted of a crime violates their probation conditions, the person is sentenced after they admit to the violation in court. In this case, the man could have seen up to life in prison on his original charge. 
Instead, Vekos dropped the violation of probation he was facing this summer, court documents show. That was despite the business owner’s insistence that Vekos prosecute the violation, the business owner said. The man was able to continue serving his years of probation outside of jail. 
“I have zero faith in the Addison County court system because of Eva. Like, zero faith,” the business owner said, using Vekos’ first name. “Every time I go to court, I always expect the worst. Always. Because that’s probably what’s going to happen.”
Vekos, asked to respond to the business owner’s complaints, said she could not do so for confidentiality reasons. In an email, she said: “My office is dedicated to supporting crime victims in all cases, which we do every day.”
Complaints of retaliation
After advocates for the Middlebury special investigations unit and Atria Collective complained about Vekos’ behavior, Vekos largely declined to communicate with them, surfacing concerns that victims weren’t being served.
“Eva Vekos has instructed her staff not to communicate with my organization,” Santa Maria, the advocacy director for Atria Collective, wrote in an email in May. She called Vekos’ behavior an example of retaliation. 
In that email, Santa Maria said, Vekos’ behavior “violates the spirit, if not the letter, of Vermont’s victims’ rights laws.” 
Similarly, after Bowdish filed an ethics complaint about Vekos in April, the prosecutor told her office not to communicate with Bowdish, according to an annual report from Bowdish’s investigations unit describing the fallout. 
Bowdish declined to comment on her ethics complaint. 
Vekos restricted Bowdish’s badge access and removed her from a state’s attorney software platform, preventing Bowdish from getting updates on cases, the annual report said.
Instead, Vekos was sending information on cases to other staff in Bowdish’s office, according to the report. That information was “often late and inaccurate,” the report said. 
“Bottom line victims are suffering,” the report said. 
At least five victims in cases investigated by Bowdish’s office retained their own attorneys due to lack of support from Vekos, according to the report. “This is something that has never happened before,” the document said. 
Vekos, in responding to questions via email, said the decision to cut off contact with Bowdish was based on advice from her attorney. Vekos said she took Bowdish off the court’s software systems back in 2023 because Bowdish, as a member of the public, shouldn’t have access to the platform. 
When asked to respond to Santa Maria’s claim, Vekos said, “There has never been any sort of retaliation against advocates in the community.” Santa Maria declined to comment. 
While conflicts between Vekos and the two community partners stewed, the only advocate directly employed by Vekos’ office, Katie Dutton, resigned in April. Dutton declined to comment. 
After Dutton left Vekos’ office, the position sat vacant for about three months. “When the office is understaffed, the whole team pitches in to make sure the job gets done,” Vekos wrote in a July email in response to a request for an interview.
During those months, Vekos’ strained relationships with Bowdish and Santa Maria bubbled to the surface. During that time period, emails sent from Bowdish describe instances in which Vekos declined to meet with victims if Bowdish was present. Those emails were obtained by VTDigger through a public records request. 
Maggie Zraly, who was hired as the victim advocate in Vekos’ office this past summer, declined a request for an interview but said her office has been a “supportive environment” where she can serve victims. 
Bowdish’s ethics complaint is still pending.
‘She doesn’t care about me or community safety’ 
Three crime victims, in addition to the business owner, told VTDigger that Vekos mistreated them. They said Vekos was disrespectful and did not take their input into their cases seriously. 
A 45-year-old Starksboro woman is the mother of one of those victims. The Starksboro woman said she has advocated for her daughter since she was sexually assaulted at age 15. 
Police affidavits describe how a 24-year-old man groomed the woman’s daughter and started picking her up late at night while her parents slept. The Starksboro woman contacted police when she looked at her daughter’s phone and found pictures of the man sexually assaulting her. 
The man was charged with four felony sexual assault counts, each of which could could carry up to 20 years in prison, along with other charges. 
The Starksboro woman and a person who works closely with cases in Vekos’ office said the assigned advocate, Bowdish, would email Vekos multiple times asking for updates about the case days before a hearing and oftentimes Vekos wouldn’t respond until minutes before court. 
The mother and her daughter told Bowdish they opposed a plea deal, and Bowdish shared their opposition with Vekos, the Starksboro woman said. 
“Even though Eva heard the things we were saying, she still went ahead with her plea deals as she made them,” the Starksboro woman said. 
In September, Vekos scaled back the charges against her daughter’s assailant to just one misdemeanor, court records show. He pled guilty and was sentenced to five years of probation, court documents show. 
For the man’s sentencing in court, the Starksboro woman’s daughter wrote a statement to the judge, saying she did not agree with the outcome and that Vekos had never consulted her. It was the third time Vekos made a plea agreement without consulting her or her mother, the daughter said. 
“This man destroyed my life. There are videos of me out there — god knows where. Do you know how terrifying that is? Do you care? It’s very clear Ms. Vekos doesn’t,” the daughter wrote.
“She doesn’t care about me or community safety. Ms. Vekos cares more about giving him the best deal than actually upholding the law,” she wrote.
Another case handled by Vekos played out similarly. 
In May 2022, a young woman who grew up in Vermont and goes to college in Virginia sought help from police after she was sexually assaulted at age 18, she said in an interview. The man she reported was originally facing a felony charge that could carry up to five years in prison, court records show. 
In December 2024, Vekos reduced the charge to a misdemeanor that only carried up to a year in prison, according to court documents. That was despite the college student’s vocal opposition, she said. 
“Everything just went smaller and smaller and smaller,” the college student said. 
The man agreed to plead no contest and, in exchange for a recommendation that he not serve any time, agreed to follow several probation conditions. None of those conditions agreed to by Vekos were geared toward preventing sex crimes, such as not working somewhere that regularly serves minors, court documents show. 
The college student and a person who works closely with cases in Vekos’ office said she found out that Vekos had agreed to the probation conditions only seven minutes before the man’s sentencing in court — meaning she did not have time to give meaningful input to Vekos or argue against his punishment.  
“Then I can’t change anything because the attorneys already made the agreement. They’ve already given it to the judge, and if they don’t inform us, it’s kind of like a ‘screw you’ situation,” the college student said. 
Like the Bristol business owner, the college student said when she complained that Vekos was discussing deals with the defense that she opposed, Vekos dismissed her concerns. Instead, Vekos complained about how much work it would create for her to push for the outcome the college student wanted, she said.
Asked about the college student’s complaints against her, Vekos said via email that she could not discuss that case and others because she’s constrained by privacy laws. 
“Also, there are several other additional sex assaults with child victims that I have prosecuted, including one involving a serial offender whose trial I personally conducted, leading to a guilty verdict and a sentence of 20 years to life,” Vekos wrote in an email. When asked what cases she was referring to in a follow-up email, the prosecutor did not specify in her reply. 
Beyond Vekos’ prosecution of sex offenses, other victims take issue with Vekos’ emotional insensitivity in their cases.

Tina Galante-Cram, a nurse who lives in Bristol, said Vekos was insensitive in her daughter’s case. 
Galante-Cram’s daughter, Jaida Cram, died after being injured in a car crash in April. Police affidavits say that Cram’s boyfriend was driving under the influence of marijuana with a suspended license.
It’s been hard to know how to live without her daughter.
“I’m not supposed to outlive my daughter,” Galate-Cram said in an interview in downtown Bristol, wearing a pink shirt printed with a picture of her daughter’s face.
Galate-Cram was 14 years old when she gave birth to her daughter and she put everything she had into raising her, she said. She wears her daughter’s ashes in a pendant around her neck. 
After her death, Cram’s boyfriend was charged with three felony crimes related to the crash, including manslaughter, court documents show. The case has since been moved to juvenile court. 
Without first consulting the mother, Galante-Cram said Vekos surprised her by proposing in court to amend the boyfriend’s probation conditions to allow him to attend Cram’s memorial.

Before the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade, a lot of women and girls died trying to end their pregnancies themselves. How many is impossible to know.
Since our current court overturned Roe, women are once again dying, as ProPublica has reported. But not in numbers anywhere near those of pre-Roe deaths from self-administered abortion. Then, as one doctor explained, “‘wire coat hangers, knitting needles, and slippery tree branches’ were the most common approaches.”
The vastly lower mortality post-Roe is the result of a number of factors, including there still being states where abortion is legal to travel to, along with abortion funds and internet forums helping people get there. 
But the biggest reason we aren’t seeing more deaths from self-managed abortion is modern medicine. Specifically, mifepristone. 
Mifepristone has been used for medication abortion in the U.S. for the past quarter century. The FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone meant women could have abortions earlier in pregnancy, rather than having to stay pregnant for weeks to have more invasive, procedural abortions. 
Patients report that a very early medication abortion can be no worse than a menstrual period. 
Today two thirds of abortions in the U.S. are medication abortions. Mifepristone is also used to treat miscarriages, which one in 10 women with known pregnancies will experience. And it is used to treat a slew of other conditions.
Opponents of legal abortion hate medication abortion. It makes it technically possible to have an abortion as soon as you suspect you are pregnant, and abortion opponents want to keep the focus on the women that they can vilify for needing later abortions. The early miscarriage induced by a medication abortion takes place in the privacy of one’s own home, depriving anti-abortion “sidewalk counselors” of the opportunity to intimidate women as they enter clinics. 
Basically, the advent of mifepristone made ending a pregnancy less painful and abortion opponents want it to be more painful.
Newly appointed Missouri Attorney General Catharine Hanaway has now joined the crusade to block access to mifepristone with a new filing in what remains of a sprawling and ridiculous lawsuit initiated in Texas that the U.S. Supreme Court mostly tossed. 
The remnants have landed in Missouri.
Anti-abortion doctors sued to have mifepristone taken off the market. The ultra-conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that claim was time-barred (again, it was approved 25 years ago). The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that, thanks to federal conscience protections entitling the doctors to deny treatment, their fear of having to provide emergency care to someone who had taken mifepristone wasn’t an injury giving them standing to sue. 
But the case lives on.
Missouri, Idaho and Kansas had intervened as fellow plaintiffs. Those states can’t sue in Texas, so the Texas district court transferred the case to Missouri, where our federal courts are newly stacked with extremely anti-abortion Trump appointees, many of whom worked on this and other anti-abortion legal efforts as attorneys. 
While the attempt to get mifepristone off the market completely is dead, plaintiffs are seeking to make it inaccessible by forcing the FDA to reinstate unnecessary restrictions. For example, requirements for multiple appointments and that the pill be taken in the presence of a physician rather than obtained at a pharmacy like most medicines. 
I had hoped Hanaway might see her job as being a good lawyer working in the interests of all Missourians, rather than a culture warring partisan like her recent predecessors. It was not to be.
The filing is another piece of work indicative of how unseriously Hanaway takes her ethical obligations as the state’s top lawyer. It is filled with distortions about the law and women’s health care. In it, she and her counterparts claim to be seeking to protect women’s safety. In reality, all the evidence shows and all the nation’s major medical groups agree that her desired outcome would put us in danger. 
It’s impossible to believe this accomplished lawyer doesn’t understand that — she just doesn’t care. 
The filing adds an additional claim against the FDA for approving a second generic version of mifepristone in September. Hanaway acknowledges that the generic is chemically identical to the branded mifepristone, but argues it shouldn’t have been approved because the brand-name drug is unsafe.
That isn’t true. As the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and nine other medical associations explained in an amicus brief, mifepristone is among the most studied drugs in the world. And those studies show it is safe.
The claim that making mifepristone harder to get will make abortion safer is audaciously disingenuous. Plaintiffs purport to lament the end of the in-person prescribing requirement because it severs the relationship between patient and doctor. These are the same people working to keep it illegal to have a medication abortion under the supervision of a local doctor. 
They are also fighting to keep mifepristone from women who are miscarrying. Even under the somewhat loosened regulations, mifepristone is largely unavailable in Missouri for miscarriage treatment because the process to become an approved prescriber remains arduous.
Mifepristone is currently completely unavailable for abortion care despite the passage of the Reproductive Freedom Initiative due to state restrictions currently being challenged in court.
Plaintiffs want mifepristone harder to access outside of Missouri. That means patients will have to have later abortions waiting for appointments and travel multiple times or spend days in hotel rooms for unnecessary additional visits. That will be too much for some people to manage or afford, causing more to order mifepristone online to self-manage — which is a massive improvement over slippery tree branches, but shouldn’t be one’s only option. 
Hanaway’s filing specifically laments that the generic’s approval could make mifepristone less expensive. Plaintiffs want to punish women for ending pregnancies by making the process as expensive, stressful, late, and medically invasive as possible.
This duplicity is not new, but it stings more coming from Missouri’s first female attorney general.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54921771475_e3916f919a_c.jpg,,,2025-12-08 06:57:23.952322

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


	A proposed budget from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that cuts funds which have meant the difference between shelter and homelessness for about 170,000 people nationwide has left communities scrambling. In Wisconsin, the cuts are projected to cause the loss of permanent housing for 2,379 people according to a report by the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The loss of funds would hit early in the new year, leaving local governments to absorb the fallout in the middle of winter. 
Korey Lundin, senior staff attorney at the National Housing Law Project and former staff attorney with Legal Action of Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the grants that HUD cut —  known as Continuum of Care (CoC) funds — “help thousands of people. That includes folks who have been recently unhoused.” In Wisconsin, 52% of permanent housing funding is covered by the CoC program. 
The people the CoC program serves, Ludin said, include “families, children, seniors, veterans, those who are survivors of domestic violence,” and others who are “not just the stereotypical image that people get when they think of a homeless person.”
In Milwaukee County, over $12 million in CoC funds covers direct rent payments to help provide housing for vulnerable county residents. The investments help support thousands of people across more than 20 housing programs. 
CoC funding in Milwaukee County supports housing for:

over 770 children;
154 young adults between 18 and 24 years old, 
560 working-age residents from 25 to 44 years old, 
590 people between the ages of 45 to 64,
826 people with no income at all, 
347 who earn only $500-$1000 a month,
1,049 people diagnosed with mental health disorders,
321 people with physical disabilities,
123 with co-occurring substance use disorders,
549 people who’ve remained in housing for over five years,
and 610 people who’ve maintained housing for 1 to 2 years. 

HUD has also proposed capping permanent housing support at 30%. In Milwaukee County 89% of CoC funds are dedicated to permanent housing beds. The picture isn’t much different for Dane County (where 78% of CoC funding goes to permanent beds), or Racine County (where 80% of CoC funding supports permanent beds). 
HUD announced the cuts saying they will help fulfill President Donald Trump’s “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” executive order. HUD claimed that cutting support for permanent housing beds across the country will restore “accountability to homelessness programs” while promoting “self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.” 
The Trump administration has been criticized for policies that essentially criminalize homelessness, jailing and displacing unhoused people in an effort to beautify cities. Lundin sees the HUD cuts as part of that effort. He told the Wisconsin Examiner, “They want to round up and warehouse the unhoused. They want to incarcerate the unhoused. The solutions they’re talking about are solutions that exacerbate homelessness.”
HUD Secretary Scott Turner has said that restricting and cutting permanent bed funding is “ending the status quo that perpetuated homelessness through a self-sustaining slush fund.” In a press release announcing the cuts, HUD criticized “the failed ‘Housing First’ ideology, which encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illnesses.”
Housing First is an approach to addressing homelessness that prioritizes placing individuals in permanent and stable housing. One 2022 study — which noted that chronic homelessness in the U.S. costs up to $3.4 billion — found that the economic benefits of implementing Housing First programs outweigh the costs of the programs. In 2023, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs published a research brief highlighting that “strong evidence exists that the Housing First model leads to quicker exits from homelessness and greater housing stability over time compared with treatment as usual.” It also stated that studies on the Housing First Model — four of which were reviewed to compile the research brief — show that the model “results in greater improvements in housing outcomes for homeless adult populations in North America.” 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who credits the county’s Housing First approach for a sharp reduction in homelessness, told the Examiner, “I am deeply concerned about the Trump administration’s move to slash permanent housing funding. This decision will destabilize housing for people across the country and it threatens the real progress we have made in Milwaukee County through our Housing First program.” Crowley noted that Milwaukee County has been recognized for having the lowest number of unsheltered homeless residents count per capita in the country, “and we are looked at as a national leader in this space. As someone who knows what housing insecurity feels like, I will pull every lever I can to protect working families and expand access to permanent housing so we can keep our state moving forward.” 
Especially in the winter, the HUD cuts could have troubling consequences. “We don’t have any state protection that prohibits people from being evicted in winter,” said Lundin, who lives in Wisconsin. “If this goes through it would be happening in the worst time here in Wisconsin in the middle of the winter.” 
Lawsuits are already being filed by cities, states and nonprofits. Lundin also said that Congress could intervene by appropriating funding for the HUD programs the administration plans to cut in 2026. In a statement to the Examiner, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) called CoC funding and homeless programs “vital to many organizations in Wisconsin and in Milwaukee who help the unhoused and keep people housed.” 
Moore said in the statement, “as per usual with this administration, it is the most vulnerable, like domestic violence survivors and LGBTQ youth, who would be hit the hardest. The Trump Administration’s proposal disregards Congress’s intent and would be catastrophic, putting 170,000 Americans at risk of homelessness. I am pleased to have joined my colleagues on several letters opposing these changes. House and Senate Members on both sides of the aisle have also pushed back because they recognize what it would do: Move us backward in the fight to end homelessness.”
Advocates are urging members of Congress to support a final HUD spending bill that increases funding for housing vouchers and protects CoC funds for permanent housing. The House and Senate version of a bill to fund HUD’s affordable housing, community development, and homelessness services programs differ by billions of dollars as the two chambers work to hammer out a year-end spending deal.

COVERT TWP. — The Palisades Nuclear Plant, a facility shut down just two years ago, is poised to become the first U.S. commercial nuclear power reactor ever to be restarted, a result of a $400 million investment announced Dec. 2 by the U.S. Department of Energy and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Proponents hail the federal funding as a validation of Michigan’s role as a clean energy leader; opponents have filed a lawsuit against it, claiming the plant’s owner inappropriately took billions in public funds.
The new investment will finance the historic recommissioning of the original reactor and the deployment of two advanced small modular reactors at the Lake Michigan site.
The combined effort is projected to nearly double the site’s capacity, supplying enough carbon-free electricity to power approximately 1.4 million Michigan households and businesses, according to the governor’s office.
The $400 million is the latest addition to a vast federal commitment to Holtec International, the plant’s owner, which includes a $1.52 billion Department of Energy loan guarantee and over $1.3 billion from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, aimed at lowering energy costs for rural electric cooperatives like Wolverine Power.
“This historic investment will double Palisades’ capacity, provide more clean energy for Michigan homes and businesses, and protect 900 good-paying Michigan jobs,” Whitmer said in a statement. “(It) will lower energy costs, reaffirm Michigan’s clean energy leadership, and show the world that we are the best place to do business.”
 A dual-technology energy hub

The facility, located in Van Buren County’s Covert Township, will combine established and advanced nuclear technology for a total baseload power capacity of 1,400 megawatts:

Original reactor restart: The 800-MW pressurized water reactor that ceased operation in May 2022 is being prepared for recommissioning, an unprecedented feat in U.S. nuclear history.
Next-generation SMRs: Holtec plans to deploy two of its advanced SMR-300 reactors, each capable of generating 300 MW.

Holtec purchased the facility in June 2022 with the initial intent to decommission it, but reversed course amid political and environmental pressure to retain the major source of carbon-free power.
The $1.9 billion in combined direct federal and state funding is the financial backbone of this resurrection, which aims to extend the plant’s operational life to at least 2051.
 Legal, technical opposition mounts

While some are celebrating the announcement, several environmental groups have filed a federal lawsuit to block the restart, accusing Holtec of a “bait-and-switch” for seeking billions in subsidies after initially planning to dismantle the facility.
The complaint was filed in Grand Rapids federal court by organizations including Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan and Michigan Safe Energy Future.
“In our view, Holtec lacks both the operational experience and demonstrated accountability required to merit public trust. If Holtec wishes to pursue these ventures, it should do so using private capital — not public funds,” Michigan Safe Energy Future said on its website.
In stark contrast to the governor’s statement, Kevin Kamp, a radioactive waste specialist for Beyond Nuclear, said Holtec’s “unprecedented zombie restart” would jumpstart a reactor that was designed in the 1960s, which could bring unknown risks.
Kamp pointed to infamous nuclear disasters throughout history, including a partial core meltdown at Fermi Unit 1 in Monroe County in 1966 and the Three Mile Island Unit 2 meltdown in 1979 in Pennsylvania.
“Just imagine what havoc could be wreaked by two 300 MW-e reactors — each 4.5 times larger — at Palisades going forward,” Kamp said.
The planned restart is rooted in a history marked by operational challenges and a premature shutdown that shocked many in Michigan. The plant first connected to the grid in 1971.
From its initial commercial operation, the facility was plagued by persistent issues: within 13 months of opening, it suffered a radioactive leak in its steam generators, leading to a year-long shutdown, previous media reports indicated.
Despite having a license valid through 2031, its previous owner, Entergy, closed it in May 2022, citing financial pressures from inexpensive natural gas and the dynamics of the deregulated electricity market. The current federal and state effort aims to resurrect the facility and safeguard regional economic stability.
Kamp noted a lengthy documented history of multiple radioactive leaks and exposures that occurred at Palisades over the decade leading up to the plant’s decommissioning, including a radiation incident involving workers in 2014, leading to the NRC downgrading the plant from a top-tier reactor.
“Palisades has a long list of breakdown phase risks,” Kamp said. “The Palisades zombie reactor has multiple pathways to reactor core meltdown, which would unleash catastrophic amounts of hazardous ionizing radioactivity into the environment, on the beach of Lake Michigan, drinking water supply for 16 million people along its shores, and more than 40 million people downstream and downwind, up the food chain, and down the generations throughout the Great Lakes region.”
If the Palisades were to melt down, thousands would be at risk of radiation poisoning and billions in property damage.
Parts of Allegan County in Casco Township are within a 10-mile radiusEmergency Planning Zone — the prime area where people could be affected by a radiation leak from the plant, and evacuations would be most likely in an emergency.
The rest of the county, as well as Holland and Ottawa County, are in a 50-mile secondary emergency zone, where people could receive indirect exposure to radiation through contaminated food and water if there were a radiation leak.
Kamp said a 1982 report said a Palisades meltdown would cause a thousand acute radiation poisoning deaths, 7,000 radiation injuries, 10,000 latent cancer fatalities, and $52 billion in property damage — and that would be much more now.
“Adjusting for inflation alone, property damage would now exceed $168 billion,” he said. “And since populations have increased around Palisades in the past 43 years, casualty figures would be significantly worse, as more people now live in harm’s way.”

(Photo courtesy the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The Indiana Department of Natural Resources has closed the bobcat trapping season after reaching the statewide quota of 250 bobcats in just four weeks.
The season was scheduled to run from Nov. 8 to Jan. 31, or until the quota of bobcats was reached.
A DNR news release said the framework of Indiana’s bobcat season was carefully designed with a total harvest limit based on population data collected throughout the state. Databases and reporting mechanisms were put into place to allow for close monitoring of the total season harvest.
“Licensed trappers had a successful first bobcat trapping season,” said Geriann Albers, DNR’s furbearer and gamebird program leader. “DNR will review what we’ve learned from this season as we move forward with regulated harvest and bobcat management.”
The bobcat season came after lawmakers passed legislation requiring the DNR to establish one. Before that, attempts to legalize killing bobcats had stalled in the DNR.
This bobcat trapping season was the first since 1969, when the species was nearly eliminated due to hunting, trapping and habitat loss. It was limited to 40 southern Indiana counties, including Brown, Monroe, Bartholomew, Clark and Dearborn.
Samantha Chapman, Indiana state director for Humane World for Animals, said “This bobcat trapping season was nothing short of a mass slaughter. Since November 8, recreational trappers have killed an average of about 9 bobcats every day, hitting the killing limit of 250 in just one month. That’s hundreds of bobcats who suffered in traps before being strangled, bludgeoned or shot to death.

The Oklahoma City business owner and her husband are evaluating their options as insurance premiums rise and subsidies are eliminated. (Photo courtesy of Kaylee Rains-Saucedo)OKLAHOMA CITY – Kaylee Rains-Saucedo relies on the federal insurance marketplace to insure her family.
Rains-Saucedo, who is wife and mother of two, is a small business owner. She has worked for three years to build her political consulting business. It’s something she doesn’t want to abandon for other employment because she believes in the American dream of owning her own business. Her husband stays at home to care for their children because child care costs are too high, she said.
Her family pays $750 a month for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, she said. 
But Rains-Saucedo has found herself among thousands of Oklahomans facing sticker shock as they navigate the re-enrollment process. Most are facing soaring costs due to a combination of higher premiums and the end of some federal tax credits that have helped make their health insurance affordable.
The Oklahoma City resident said her monthly premium will rise to about $1,350 to $1,550. She gets a credit of about $400 a month to offset the premium cost.
“Right now, it means I am going to have to choose between having health insurance or being able to put food on the table,” she said.
The Rains-Saucedo said is trying to pick up more business, which will mean more time away from her family.
“It’s just a really big problem for us,” she said. “I honestly don’t know what we are going to do financially yet, until I can find more work.”
More than 300,000 Oklahomans rely on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health insurance, said Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready.
And of those, 97% are receiving some level of subsidy to offset their premiums, Mulready said.
Most consumers will see their average insurance premiums increase by 29%, he said. 
The loss of subsidies coupled with premium increases represent a “double whammy for the consumer,” Mulready said.
He said he fears the cost increases will deter young healthy people from enrolling. They’ll opt instead to go without health insurance, Mulready said.
“That is not a good situation,” Mulready said. “You need young, healthy people to participate.”
About 289,000 Oklahoman receive the enhanced tax credit of $559 a month, said Rich Rasmussen, president and CEO of the Oklahoma Hospital Association.
Oklahoma consumers receive about $1.9 billion in premium assistance, which is set to end Jan. 1, unless Congress acts, he said.
The U.S. Senate is set to vote on extending those enhanced tax credits Thursday, but the plan may not have the bipartisan support needed to advance.
Jennifer Eastwood, of Norman, buys her insurance through the federal insurance marketplace and receives a subsidy. She said she has several medical conditions, including Lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks healthy tissue.
“I am going to lose my insurance and go off all my treatments unless something changes at the last minute,” Eastwood said.
Broader implications
The increase in premiums and reduction in subsidies has broader implications for Oklahoma.
According to the Cicero Institute, Oklahoma ranks in the bottom for primary care and physician availability. 
The state ranks 48th nationally in physician supply, 46th in primary care doctors and 47th in general surgeons, according to the Cicero Institute, a nonpartisan policy organization.
Of the state’s 77 counties, 75 are health care professional shortage areas.
The problem is particularly acute in rural Oklahoma, where patients have longer waits and spend more time on the road to access care.
Oklahoma already has the second highest rate of uninsured in the country, said Zack Stoycoff, executive director of Healthy Minds, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank that tries to improve mental health outcomes in Oklahoma.
For the uninsured, the options are to seek health care through charities, whose services are often overwhelmed and underfunded, Stoycoff said.
The other option is to seek treatment that costs more, such as through a hospital emergency room, resulting in uncompensated care and more costs to the facility, he said.
“Hospitals are already strapped, especially rural hospitals,” he said.
Rasmussen said the changes will hit rural hospitals and providers hard and will impact the health care professional shortage.
The ability to have health care correlates to a person’s ability to be employed and contribute to society, Stoycoff said.
“We want people to be healthy and have insurance, because it is ultimately more cost effective,” he said.
Up at night
The rising premiums and reduction in subsidies has caused “intense anxiety” for Rains-Saucedo, the Oklahoma City mother and business owner. 
She worries about being hit with a large medical bill that will take years to pay off.
“It has just made me stay up at night,” she said.

Meanwhile, the state is staring down long-term economic decline. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers square off with business council over government’s role in economic development appeared first on WyoFile .","Competing visions for the state’s economic future clashed Thursday as the Wyoming Business Council presented its budget proposal to the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee in Cheyenne. 
While the council has functioned as Wyoming’s statewide economic development agency since its creation in 1998, some lawmakers argue that government shouldn’t be involved. Meanwhile, the business council is warning that stagnant job and wage growth, as well as low workforce availability, are fueling long-term economic decline in Wyoming. 
“The markers of GDP, the markers of wages, the markers of [the] number of job opportunities, the outmigration of our youth and the widening gap between our population and our workforce all spell that our economy is not where we want it to be,” Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell told lawmakers Thursday. 
The Appropriations Committee met in Cheyenne last week for the first round of budget hearings ahead of the 2026 legislative session. After one lawmaker expressed interest in eliminating the business council, Thursday’s hearing put the agency squarely in the hot seat.  
“The business council today is a place where we understand the problem that we have better than ever,” Dorrell told lawmakers. “We understand the resources that we have or don’t have better than ever. And we understand that we’ve built a foundation that can be utilized as a way to change the economy.”

Josh Dorrell, CEO of the Wyoming Business Council (Wyoming Business Council)

Part of advancing Wyoming’s economy, Dorrell said, will require policy changes, including reforming the agency’s Business Ready Community grant and loan program. It’s also going to require more funding, he said. 
The council is asking lawmakers for about $112 million, while Gov. Mark Gordon’s recommendation for the agency is about half of that amount at nearly $55 million. However, Dorrell said, both of those figures would ultimately come up short, particularly when it comes to helping communities meet infrastructure needs, like extending water and sewer to business parks. 
“I thank you for giving us the courtesy of truth,” Senate Appropriations Chairman Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, said. “For you to be successful, you believe your budget should be somewhere over a billion, correct?”
“Mr. Chairman, yes,” Dorrell said. 
Gordon’s recommendation
House Appropriations Committee Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, asked Dorrell about the discrepancy between the agency’s request and the governor’s recommendation. 
“I don’t see any other agencies where he’s denying half of the requests,” Bear said. “So that’s a pretty significant difference from your view and his.”
Dorrell confirmed that he told the governor neither budget was sufficient, but he also told Bear that Gordon has an entire state budget to consider and balance in his recommendations.
Lawmakers did not ask Gordon last Monday when he testified about the discrepancy, but in a Friday press release, the governor’s office reiterated that his budget recommendations are just that, because lawmakers are statutorily the state’s appropriators. 
“The Joint Appropriations Committee and the Legislature have often restored cuts to agency requests when they felt the increases were needed,” the press release said. “Governor Gordon’s budget has close to half a billion dollars on the table for the Legislature to make such decisions, including putting more into savings to benefit future generations.”

Gordon also pointed to his budget message, where he called for “maintaining low tax burdens and pursuing legal frameworks that attract new investment to broaden Wyoming’s economic base.” 
Council’s request
Ahead of last week’s hearings, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — a group of Republicans who control the House — pledged to cut the budget, citing “pre-pandemic spending levels” as a general target. 
Dorrell told the committee Thursday that his agency’s budget request of almost $112 million “is actually less than the one that was submitted in 2019.”
Even so, several members of the committee expressed skepticism about funding the agency at all. Bear, for example, said he sees numerous issues with governments like Wyoming intervening to compete with other states in attracting private businesses.
“I understand that’s your responsibility … to try to compete with other states, make us competitive in that arena. But prior to that, you know, we’re 250 years old this next year. And prior to that, we went 150 years without government intervening in private sector business,” Bear said. 
“Don’t you agree that we have a great history in this country of private sector production?” Bear asked Dorrell. 
“Of course, I would agree with that,” Dorrell said. “And I might add that, you know, one of the things that we’re working to do is solve the problem that we have in front of us.” 
“I don’t get to go back 100 years to when states didn’t compete,” Dorrell said. “I get to solve the problem I have today. And the problem that we have today is that our outmigration of our youth and people who are born in this state is greater than any other state in the nation.”
Between 60% to 70% of Wyoming-born residents permanently leave the state by the time they are 30, according to a 2024 analysis prepared for the business council by Harvard Kennedy School researchers.

Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, however, said he did “some research” and “found a couple of sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau that dispute” the outmigration findings that he hears from the business council “and others.”
“I just say that because I’m really interested in the truth,” Pendergraft said. 
Dorrell said while he hoped to be wrong about Wyoming’s outmigration, “our population and the demographics of our population would say that we’re probably right on.” 
Philosophical differences 
Pendergraft also said one of the criticisms he hears of the business council is “picking winners and losers,” and pointed to a metal fabricator in Sheridan County that was awarded a grant by the council, while there are other entities in the community that do the same work. 
The council only considers awarding grants to those who apply, Dorrell said, asking that Pendergraft provide him with “the names of those organizations that might be interested in this.”
Pendergraft also said he disputed the results of a statewide poll the business council completed earlier this year.
In September, the Tarrance Group, a Virginia-based Republican strategic research and polling firm, surveyed 514 registered voters in Wyoming about economic conditions, development priorities and community growth. 
“The results reveal a strong mandate for proactive, community-led growth and a clear consensus on the urgent need to retain our young people to build resilient communities,” according to an October press release from the council.
“I reject those results personally,” Pendergraft said, adding that “there were problems with how it was phrased.” 
Pendergraft also pushed back on the need for a business council at all. “How do you answer those that say it is not the role of government to build infrastructure?” he asked. “Leave that to the free market. Leave that to the businesses to develop that. Leave that to the consumers that want those things. How do you respond?”
It goes back to the problem of economic decline, Dorrell said, and there are plenty of examples across the state that indicate that the state’s minimal “investment in infrastructure” is working against Wyoming. 
“The idea that the state or that the community shouldn’t pay for infrastructure, that experiment is sort of running right now, and what it’s saying is that people are leaving and what it’s saying is our economy is in decline,” Dorrell said. 
Budget hearings will continue through this week before resuming Jan. 5. The committee is not expected to take any formal action on the budget bill until the week of Jan. 12.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s State Chamber needs to step aside and stop meddling in something they clearly know nothing about: education.
It’s clear from both public and media appearances that this influential business advocacy body is completely out of its depth in solving the education crisis which has long plagued Oklahoma.
Case in point: leaders of the group act like they’ve suddenly discovered that we rank at bottom in childhood literacy and that wealthy, established businesses don’t want to come here in large part because of that.
In a recent interview with Oklahoma City television station Fox 25, Chad Warmington, the group’s CEO, said it is “kind of fun to give the speech” to community groups that we rank at the bottom in reading. He said that he saw “surprise” and “shock” on people’s faces as he broke the news about our low rankings, including 49th in third grade literacy.
Tone deaf much? First off, nobody should be taking pleasure in discussing our students’ struggles. And secondly, I’d like to know who exactly in Oklahoma doesn’t know we’re cellardwellers in education outcomes. That news is not exactly a mic drop moment.
And in a further sign that business leaders in this group haven’t left their cushy corner offices and deigned to interact with us mere mortals, Warmington added during the interview that “a lot of political leaders” are talking about literacy that haven’t talked about it before.
I don’t know a single politician who hasn’t been talking about our lagging education outcomes and our low literacy rates. In fact, everybody has been talking about this for years now — both inside and outside the Capitol and trying to figure out how to fix it. 
But if all this wasn’t enough, the group is enthusiastically — and offensively — likening our children’s inability to read to the University of Oklahoma having a bad football season in the SEC and Oklahoma State University tanking in the Big 12. “Outrage would be deafening” if our reading scores were college football rankings, Warmington wrote in an editorial for The Oklahoman. 
“Coaches would be fired, strategies overhauled, and fans would never settle for it.”
To be clear, Oklahomans have not settled for this. Outrage already is deafening about education, and if the business community doesn’t know that then they’re completely out of touch with reality. Discussions about schools already dominate the 2026 gubernatorial race and conversations in the halls of our state Capitol.
To make better use of sports analogies, we cannot fire children’s parents, who are the equivalent of their head coaches, or the teachers we rely on to educate them. We already don’t have enough qualified people at the helm of our classrooms.
And, this is not the equivalent of a bad football season. This is more akin to the Chicago Cub’s 108-year World Series drought. The inability to read ripples across multiple generations.
And that’s why it’s so troubling that this advocacy group, which until recently has largely ignored this situation, has parachuted in during our crisis, claiming they have the golden bullet to solve our horrendous education outcomes — what many in education circles call the “Mississippi Miracle.”
Both Oklahoma and Mississippi passed laws in 2013 aimed at increasing literacy before fourth grade. The National Assessment of Education Progress test results showed Mississippi rose from last nationally to 21st. The state ranks second nationally in reading for children in poverty. Oklahoma, which later changed its law, has not seen similar progress.
The progress in Mississippi is attributed largely to the $100 million investment Jim and Sally Barksdale gave to develop a program to increase public school literacy rates. The money was overseen by an independent entity, not that state’s Department of Education. And the Barksdales demanded quantifiable results.
Warmington said Mississippi aligned the curriculum its higher education institutions are teaching teachers. They made sure that every school system is using the “same science of reading.” They brought in literacy coaches. And they held children back who weren’t reading at grade level.
That’s  great for Mississippi, but as I noted earlier we can’t get even qualified people to teach in Oklahoma. We’re so desperate for teachers, we’re allowing people with no education degree to lead our classrooms, so teaching the same curriculum in college really doesn’t matter in our case. 
Literacy coaches are going to cost money and require a financial investment from our Legislature, at a time when they’re obsessed with cutting taxes and giving big businesses tax breaks. 
During the 2023-24 school year, Oklahoma ranked 49th worst in what it spent per pupil at $11,311. Mississippi, meanwhile, spent $12,490 per student, according to an apples-to-apples comparison compiled by the National Education Association.
In the 2024-25 school year, Oklahoma was estimated to have spent $11,894 per student while Mississippi further widened the gap, spending $13,125. 
Both numbers represented about a 5% increase in spending.
Our class sizes are bigger in Oklahoma, too, probably because we don’t invest more in education. Mississippi had 13.6 students enrolled per teacher. Oklahoma had 16.3 students, according to the NEA analysis.
It’s easier to learn with smaller class sizes.
If we want to be Mississippi, we’re going to have to make a financial investment in schools.
To oversimplify our literacy crisis and say it can be solved by implementing the “Mississippi Miracle” is a mistake. Mississippi Today also reported that “reading miracle” has remained out of reach for some schools due to resource shortages and teacher turnover. 
Education systems are complex. No two children are completely alike or learn the same.
Solving this is going to take a multi-level approach, and require involving people who actually understand what is going on. 
That’s not the business community. We need to consult the people who are on the front lines, including those who work in low-performing and high poverty schools, who haven’t had the privilege of turning a blind eye to the problem and who, for years, haven’t been allowed to be complacent about it.
Warmington has said he wants to involve teachers in these discussions, but oddly enough, when the state Chamber held its business luncheon last month to unveil its vision for our schools, there wasn’t a single teacher highlighted. Only business leaders and Oklahoma lawmakers – none of whom had teaching experience – were the ones celebrating the state Chamber’s plan, which they dubbed Oklahoma Competes. 
Even more damning, state superintendent Lindel Fields said he didn’t attend.
Educators don’t tell CEOs how to run their businesses. So why should we trust people who don’t seem to ever set foot in schools to set this agenda for us?

(Photo by Kypros/Getty Images)New Jersey’s homeless population has crept up in recent years, and housing advocates say it is poised to skyrocket because President Donald Trump’s administration is changing how it funds permanent housing for people most at risk of homelessness.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development adopted new grant policies last month that critics warn would cancel already appropriated funds and force as many as 170,000 people — including more than 2,000 people in New Jersey — into homelessness.
“At a time when homelessness in New Jersey has been increasing, we have federal action that will definitely further increase homelessness,” said Arnold Cohen, senior policy coordinator at the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey.
Young homebuyers lose more ground in housing market

New Jersey got about $66 million last year in federal funding to cover rent and supportive services for people most at risk of homelessness, said Taiisa Kelly, CEO of Monarch Housing Associates.
The state is expected to lose more than half of that, with cuts starting on Jan. 1, if HUD proceeds with its policy changes, Kelly said. Twenty states, including New Jersey, have sued to block the changes.
“We’re really waiting to see what will happen from that lawsuit,” Kelly said. “We really need a reversal of course on this, because this is going to immediately cause folks to experience homelessness, and it’s going to fundamentally change the programs — and change them in a way that we know doesn’t work.”
New Jersey uses what’s called a housing-first approach to homelessness reduction, which gets people into stable housing without conditioning it on sobriety, income, or other things that have historically served as hurdles to housing security. Once a person is stably housed, providers work to get them supportive services to address their other needs.
Proponents of the strategy say it’s a key approach to making homelessness “rare, brief, and non-recurring,” said Richard Uniacke, president of Bridges Outreach, a nonprofit that does street outreach and provides housing services in Union, Essex, and Somerset counties.
HUD has encouraged housing-first policies for over a decade.
But Trump announced in a July executive order that his administration would take a different approach. He rejected housing-first policies, saying they “deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency.” He ordered mandatory treatment for people whose mental illness or addiction contributed to their homelessness and directed law enforcement to crack down on homeless encampments, loitering, squatting, and open drug use.
HUD officials consequently announced last month a series of changes that would cut two-thirds of the $3.9 billion in federal funds it had allocated for permanent housing; shift funding to transitional housing with work and other requirements; reduce automatic renewals of housing vouchers; and withhold funds from applicants that follow housing-first policies.
The Trump administration pitched the changes as “monumental reforms,” saying housing-first policies encourage “dependence on endless government handouts” while not addressing the root causes of homelessness.
“Our philosophy for addressing the homelessness crisis will now define success not by dollars spent or housing units filled, but by how many people achieve long-term self-sufficiency and recovery,” said HUD chief Scott Turner. “These long-overdue reforms will promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe.”
The agency also now forbids grant recipients from using funds in ways that violate the Trump administration’s immigration agenda or opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion and “gender ideology.” Critics say that threatens housing assistance and supportive services for certain marginalized groups, such as transgender youth, who experience homelessness at disproportionately high rates.
“They’re putting us in a position where we actually run the risk of breaking state laws in order to adapt to some of these requirements,” Uniacke said. “We have to provide services with no preconditions. We cannot be coercive of people who are experiencing homelessness in order to get them to treatment or get them connected to services.”
The National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates HUD’s changes could cost New Jersey $37.6 million in lost federal funding, leaving 2,439 people at risk of losing their housing. New Jersey had nearly 13,800 people living in shelters, hotels, or on the street as of last January, the most recent annual enumeration of the state’s homeless population. The alliance believes homelessness could climb in New Jersey by almost 18% next year.

Kelly warns that a jump in the state’s homeless population will have an impact that ripples far beyond those who lose their housing.
“We’re going to see agencies that have to close because they’re going to lose so much money from the program,” Kelly said. “It’s going to impact landlords who rely on this rental assistance payment to keep up their units. It’s just going to destabilize our communities across the board. So it’s really important that we collectively find an answer.”
Advocates say answers should include increased philanthropy, rent control, and the passage of legislation that would detail rights for New Jersey’s homeless population and allow municipalities to create homelessness trust funds, among other things.
Mostly, they agree, any effort to end homelessness cannot succeed without more money.
Kelly estimated $430 million would cover rental assistance for a year and supportive services for the 18,000 families who, according to a state database, accessed homelessness services in New Jersey last year.
Cohen agreed funding is the game-changer, pointing to a state effort, launched in 2024, to get more than 1,000 homeless veterans permanent housing.
“We have municipalities in New Jersey that have essentially ended homelessness for veterans because those resources have been there,” he said. “We have not put those resources into families.”

Property taxes are one of the only guardrails we have that discourage people from hoarding land and housing they do not use, writes Rep. Mike Yin.
The post Eliminating property taxes would sell out Wyoming forever appeared first on WyoFile .","Every Wyoming town with a good view, a nearby outdoor recreation area, a small airport or a good marketing campaign could become a target for out-of-state investors. The more real estate these investors buy, the tighter the housing market becomes for the people who actually live and work in those communities. With less inventory and more outside demand, prices go up, making housing unattainable for Wyoming families and future generations. 

Opinion

This is the future we are driven toward by one simple idea: no property taxes.
The Legislature’s Joint Revenue Committee has put forward a proposal to eliminate residential property taxes in Wyoming.
Every Wyomingite should take a step back and look hard at what this plan, which would also require voter approval, would really do. If this proposal passes, we will permanently turn our communities into a discount investment product for people who do not live here. The end result, transforming Wyoming into a full-blown tax shelter for out-of-state residents, will only make it even harder for young people and working families to afford a home. In short, by eliminating property taxes, we sell out our future. 
Property taxes are one of the only guardrails we have that discourage people from hoarding land and housing they do not use. If I am a wealthy out-of-state investor and I see land in a beautiful, low-population state with no property tax at all, I start running the numbers in my head. No ongoing expense. No annual tax bill. No cost to sit on a second, third or fourth house for years and wait for prices to rise. 
In that world, I would try to buy as much Wyoming land and housing as I could as fast as possible. And I would have no incentive to sell it again anytime soon, and certainly not for an affordable price. 
We already see this pressure in places where demand from wealthy out-of-state buyers is strong. When homes are treated first as an asset and only second as a place to live, prices rise faster than local wages. Teachers, nurses, sheriff’s deputies and service workers get pushed further and further away from the communities they serve. Property taxes create a carrying cost for holding multiple homes that sit empty most of the year, while paying for the critical services and infrastructure that make those homes livable in the first place. Eliminating property taxes would make speculative buying even more attractive. 
This is exactly the opposite of the Wyoming that we say we want for our kids and grandkids. We say we want young people to stay in Wyoming, start families and build careers here. We say we want them to be able to buy a home in the town where they grew up. A policy that invites unlimited outside demand for housing undercuts that goal. It tilts the playing field toward cash buyers who fly in a few weeks a year and away from the family trying to scrape together a down payment from a Wyoming paycheck.
There is another honest conversation we need to have. When politicians promise to get rid of property taxes, they almost always plan to make it up somewhere else, usually with a big increase to the statewide sales tax.
That might sound harmless until you think about who really pays.
The biggest landowners see their property tax bills disappear. That burden gets passed to the mom in Rock Springs buying clothes and notebooks for the first day of school.It gets passed to the dad in Casper paying for his kids’ hockey equipment and a pair of winter boots.It gets passed to the worker in Gillette trying to keep the truck running and pay the electricity bill that keeps going up. 
The owner of three houses in Jackson comes out ahead. The family trying to afford one modest home pays more every time they go through the checkout line.
That isn’t tax relief for the middle class. It is shifting the burden from the wealthiest landowners to the everyday Wyomingites who have to spend most of their paycheck just to get by.
Everything is getting more expensive, but the answer is not to blow up our entire tax system, which would make things worse. It’s to continue working on targeted relief that actually reaches the people who need help, and to build more housing for the middle class.
The Legislature has expanded the state property tax refund program so that more middle-class homeowners can qualify. It is not perfect and we should keep improving it, but it has already helped keep Wyomingites in their homes. 
And we can build on that work with real housing policy. That means working with local governments on land use to ensure that middle-class housing, rather than just high-end inventory, is possible to develop. It means making it easier to finance the infrastructure that new homes require.
There are solutions. But first, we have to answer a basic question: Who is Wyoming for?
Is it for the people who live here year round, who send their kids to our schools, who volunteer at the food bank, who plow the roads, who run the clinics and fix the power lines? Or is it for investors who want a safe place to park wealth in the form of land and houses they rarely use?
Eliminating property taxes would send a very clear signal about the Legislature’s answer to that question. I hope we choose differently.

To preserve public confidence in the judiciary, the commission ensures judges adhere to ethical standards, writes commission member Nicholas Bellack.
The post Safeguarding justice: The Wyoming Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics appeared first on WyoFile .","When most of us think about judges, we imagine solemn black robes, gavel strikes and the rule of law being carefully applied in our courtrooms. But what happens if a judge acts unethically, fails to follow the law or loses the public’s trust? In Wyoming, the answer lies with a little-known but essential body: the Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics.

Opinion

This constitutionally created, independent commission exists to ensure that Wyoming’s judges uphold the high standards the public expects. These ethical standards, which all judicial officers from municipal court judges to supreme court justices must adhere to, can be found in the Wyoming Code of Judicial Conduct. For nearly 50 years, the commission has been the guardian of accountability in our judicial system — preserving citizens’ confidence in the courts.
A history rooted in accountability
The commission traces its origins to 1970, when Wyoming voters approved a constitutional amendment creating the Judicial Supervisory Committee. At the time, this was a groundbreaking step acknowledging that even judges, who interpret the law, must themselves be held to standards of conduct.
In 1996, Wyoming voters updated the system, replacing the Supervisory Committee with today’s 12-member Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics. Its authority comes directly from Article 5, Section 6 of the Wyoming Constitution and its independence within the judicial branch is by design. The people of Wyoming insisted that accountability for judges should not be left to politics or personal influence, but entrusted to a balanced panel representing the judiciary, the legal profession and the public itself.
Who serves on the commission?
The commission consists of 12 volunteers and is deliberately diverse in its composition. This includes:

Three judges (two from the district court and one from the circuit court), chosen by their fellow judges.
Three attorneys, appointed by the Wyoming State Bar.
Six citizen members, known as “electors,” appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate.

This structure ensures that no single group dominates. Instead, legal professionals and everyday citizens share responsibility for reviewing judicial conduct complaints, providing an important safeguard for public trust.
How do complaints work?
The commission’s work begins when someone files a written, verified complaint against a judge. These complaints can allege judicial misconduct, criminal wrongdoing, civil misconduct or even disability that affects a judge’s ability to serve.
Interestingly, the commission also has the power to launch investigations on its own if credible concerns surface. This means that misconduct cannot simply be hidden if no one files paperwork.
Once a complaint is received, the process unfolds through a careful three-panel system:

The investigatory panel reviews the complaint, gathers records and may request a response from the judge. If necessary, it hires disciplinary counsel to dig deeper.
The adjudicatory panel holds hearings, applies the Wyoming Code of Judicial Conduct and determines whether the Code of Judicial Conduct was violated.
The disciplinary panel determines consequences that range from private discipline to public sanctions that the Wyoming Supreme Court must approve.

This step-by-step process ensures fairness for both the public and the judge involved.
Confidential, but not secret 
One of the commission’s most misunderstood features is confidentiality. By rule, all proceedings remain confidential unless and until a case results in a recommendation for public discipline. This protects judges from unfounded rumors and ensures that investigations are conducted fairly, rather than through the court of public opinion.
At the same time, the system is transparent where it matters most. If public discipline is warranted, the commission makes recommendations to the Wyoming Supreme Court, which has the final say. This balance helps protect judicial independence while still holding judges accountable to the people they serve.
What the numbers say
Between January 2024 and July 2025, the commission handled 79 cases:

57 complaints were dismissed quickly, often because they lacked evidence, did not fall under the commission’s jurisdiction or arose from problems that another agency could better address. For example, many were complaints about the outcome of a case more appropriately dealt with through appeal. In those instances, the commission refers members of the public to the more appropriate body.  
15 cases were dismissed after deeper review.
One judge received a letter of caution and another a letter of correction.
One private censure was issued, requiring monitoring of the judge’s conduct.
Four cases remain open.

These numbers show that while most complaints do not result in disciplinary action, the commission takes each one seriously. Even minor concerns can lead to corrective action designed to keep judges accountable.
Why the commission matters 
Most Wyomingites will never file a complaint with the commission or even hear its name in daily conversation. Yet its presence is critical. By diligently performing its work, the commission reassures the public that our judges are not beyond scrutiny.
In 1996, Wyoming voters understood a simple truth: Justice depends on trust. If citizens doubt the integrity of their judges, the entire system falters. The Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics exists to preserve public confidence in the judiciary, demonstrating that while judges interpret the law, they are also held accountable under rules of ethical standards.
For the average citizen, this means one thing: The next time you walk into a courtroom, you will know that while the judge has a good deal of authority, he or she also has accountability.

The group offered advice, including: Higher paying jobs with growth potential, affordable housing, better public transit and bike lanes, beautiful spaces, an inclusive community and political leadership that listens.
“We aren’t just an ag state,” one person responded in the interactive electronic survey taken at a public forum hosted by the City of Omaha Tuesday that featured a panel of speakers and drew an estimated 125 people. 
 Spotlight intensifies

About 70 attendees participated in the poll aimed at informing the city’s efforts to better attract and retain talent, particularly as it assembles a new “comprehensive plan” to guide growth and development over the next 20 years.
Given that more than half of Nebraska’s brain drain originates in the metro Omaha area, it is significant that city leaders are stepping up efforts to better understand and attack the problem, said Josie Schafer, a public policy and data researcher at the University of Nebraska at Omaha who spoke at the event and also advises the Nebraska Legislature on workforce trends.

Since 2019, about 17,000 people who have earned a bachelor’s degree or higher have left Nebraska and just over 10,000 moved from the Omaha area, said Schafer, who heads the UNO Center for Public Affairs Research.
“I’m really excited to see the city jumping in on this conversation and finding solutions that fit for us,” she said, noting that its urban economy and other circumstances differ from the many rural areas of the state.
Other local and state efforts and groups also are  converging to stem the exodus in what many see as an alarming wake-up moment for Nebraska as a whole, and particularly its two largest metros.
The Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, whose audience covers eight counties, is about to commission an in-depth brain drain-focused study, a spokesman said last week. Sparking that was the chamber’s latest “Barometer report,” which ranked the Omaha metro sixth lowest of 23 peer metros nationwide for jobs, talent and investment. 
A lead economist working on the report said the findings shined light on “uncomfortable truths” that must be confronted with “urgency.” The chamber’s young professionals group also had been gathering feedback.
Amplifying its alarm is the Aksarben Foundation, a more than century-old Nebraska business organization. Its research shows Nebraska’s two largest metros, Omaha and Lincoln, have lagged 68,000 jobs behind where both would have been had the markets kept pace the last five years with peers, including Des Moines, Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Fayetteville, Arkansas. 
Further probing by Aksarben’s research team has revealed widespread talent and wage loss in every region of the state, driven largely, it said, by scarcity of quality jobs and limited wage growth. Now the Aksarben leadership has formed a new nonprofit, “Strengthening Nebraska Families” to educate and stir action to elevate the state’s competitiveness. 
 ‘Without connection’ 

Aksarben’s Dana Bradford said discussion about brain drain — and the forces that for more than a decade have pushed more folks out of the state than in — have been going for some time, but “without connection.”

As the state’s budget woes become more pronounced and persistent — a $471 million shortfall is the latest projection — people and policymakers are starting to pay more attention, he said. 
“It’s pretty clear if Omaha and Lincoln were growing anywhere like they should have been we wouldn’t have the problem we have right now,” said Bradford, also a past chair of the Omaha chamber. “The reality is Omaha and Lincoln deliver 60% of tax revenues. If Omaha is struggling, everybody struggles.”
On Monday, the Aksarben Foundation is hosting a private meeting in the Ashland area, between Omaha and Lincoln, for select business, elected and other leaders intended to stimulate more discussion. 
Nebraska officials including Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. are to speak, as are experts expected to spotlight strategies in play or working elsewhere in the country to grow high-paying jobs and the talent pool.
Omaha still pushing for state incentive to help build sports facilities, despite Pillen headwinds

Ewing told the Nebraska Examiner he recognizes the urgency for quality job creation and wants to partner with state lawmakers and other elected officials on developing an economic incentive package that raises Omaha’s allure to new employers. 
“We also have companies I’ve talked to that would like to expand here, but the incentives are greater in other places,” he said, adding that he’s been told existing incentives are too laborious and should be easier to navigate.
The Democratic mayor, finishing his first year after ousting a 12-year Republican incumbent, said he and his administration are working to increase public and private support for business internships, public transportation options and affordable housing, which survey-takers underscored as pieces that could keep them from leaving Omaha. 
Public spaces are another focus to raise Omaha’s “fun” factor, Ewing said. He cited efforts to build a downtown soccer stadium and an expanded multi-purpose athletic complex in northwest Omaha that need a state tax incentive that Gov. Jim Pillen has for now put on ice, citing budget concerns.
Ewing is promoting new arrangements in which private foundations take on management and maintenance at certain city parks, saying that would allow city park staff to focus on fewer properties.

Creation of the new comprehensive 20-year growth and development plan also will help shape Omaha’s future infrastructure, amenities and talent-retention strategies. The city has been hosting meetings, including Tuesday’s brain drain-focused discussion, to inform the document. 
Land use updates, for example, could promote more “walkability” in districts. Other rules could encourage more communal areas and “belonging.” Those themes arose in survey recommendations. 
 Brain gain winners 

While social, civic and environmental factors play a role in brain drain, Schafer said that independent and Census-based research overwhelmingly point to jobs and career growth potential as top drivers of the out-migration trend.
A look at places outperforming Omaha in the brain gain contest, some without coastal sunshine and splash, underscore that Nebraska could compete with the right game plan, she said.
Denver and Stockton, California metros are in the pack where people recently moved to when leaving the Omaha area, census data shows. But Des Moines and Kansas City consistently rank in the top five, said Schafer. 
“These are places that have similar settings, environments, weather,” she said. “It’s not that they’re searching for something totally different from Omaha. The evidence really points to job opportunities as that leading factor.”

 As Omaha lost people to other states, peer metro areas that gained domestic migrants included Knoxville, Tennessee and Tulsa, Oklahoma, according to Census data.
In Tulsa, a program that has paid more than 3,400 remote workers $10,000 each to move there and diversify the workforce reportedly has returned four times its investment to the local economy.
According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, transplants consistently say they were drawn to that metro area by job opportunity, lifestyle change and affordable cost of living. The state of Tennessee does not levy a personal income tax.
According to the Aksarben study conducted by Development Counsellors International, the Omaha metro’s employment level barely grew over the past five years, inching up from 500,000 in 2019 to 512,000 last year. DCI said Lincoln’s employment and wage growth were nearly the same as Omaha’s.
A comparison group of metros, in contrast, grew jobs five times faster. The group: Colorado Springs, Des Moines, Fayetteville, Sioux Falls, Huntsville, Alabama, Raleigh, North Carolina and Boise, Idaho. 
Bradford said the new Strengthening Nebraska Families nonprofit aims to educate and provoke conversation about declining discretionary income for families. The DCI study and Aksarben leaders point to recruitment and development of “primary” jobs as a goal.  
Defined in the report as positions that pay above-average wages and produce goods or services for markets beyond the local area, primary jobs bring new wealth and dollars into the local and state economy. They also lead to creation of additional jobs in secondary sectors, such as medical, local banks, car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants.
Losing young adults to other states comes at a high price, the experts say, as those out-migrants build families and future workforce elsewhere.
 Forum highlights 

Among other highlights shared at the City of Omaha-organized meeting at Creighton University campus:

Brain drain, or net out-migration of Nebraskans with a bachelor’s degree or more, has persisted since 2010, with losses of 1,104 people in 2010, 4,610 in 2022 and 3,622 in 2023. 
The Omaha metro area is growing in population due to births and immigration, surpassing the million-person mark, according to Census data released earlier this year. However, for domestic migration, the state’s largest metro loses 723 people annually, according to UNO’s analysis of Census data between 2020 to 2024. 
Meanwhile, the Tulsa metro posted annual domestic migration gains of about 26,000; Kansas City about 8,000, Des Moines nearly 17,000. The Lincoln metro’s annual net domestic loss was 1,720.
Top places from where new Omahans came in recent years: Lincoln metro area, Asia, Europe, Sioux City metro area and the Des Moines metro area.

Experts on the “We Make Omaha’s Talent x Place” panel moderated by Omaha planner Sydney Embray also included Laurel Oetken of Open Range; Tammy Green of Metropolitan Community College and Dell Gines of International Economic Development Council.
The survey also asked about diversity, equity and inclusion programs. (Courtesy of UNO Center for Public Affairs Research)
Gines encouraged less emphasis on population growth and more on creating a distinct identity and quality of life improvements.
Green advocated for investment in growing skills for existing young populations and creating welcoming environments. 
Oetken said young generations seek an inviting entrepreneurial and tech ecosystem.
 Lessons learned

Aksarben’s Bradford said lessons can be learned from cities like Tulsa and the Kansas City’s Overland Park area, which attracted a new Fiserv strategic fintech hub by offering an incentives package that helped secure a commitment of 2,000 new jobs. 
Kansas is giving Fiserv more than $154 million in state incentives over the ten years, the Kansas City Star reported, and the city puts the average salary at $125,000.
“We have to do these kinds of things to compete or we’ll have no opportunities for success,” Bradford said. “Or we can do nothing and see how that goes.”



What survey-takers said
Omaha planners analyzed responses to the unscientific poll last week. Among results:

Is Omaha doing enough to retain talent? On a scale of 1 to 10, only 9 of 69 responses were above midpoint.
Think of someone you know who has left Omaha. Why did they leave? After jobs, opportunity and diversity/belonging came recreation/amenities/culture, transportation/walkability, political climate.

If you were to leave Omaha, what would be the main reason? After jobs and opportunities came transportation/walkability, culture/amenities/recreation; political climate, housing/livability.

(Getty Images)Idahoans have a week to pick or switch health insurance plans on the state’s exchange, as open enrollment for Your Health Idaho ends Dec. 15.
And unless Congress extends tax credits that deeply subsidize health insurance costs, Idahoans’ average premiums are expected to double on the exchange next year, possibly prompting thousands to cancel their policies. 
It’ll take time to see the full impact. Idahoans usually enroll in insurance plans on the exchange during the last week of open enrollment, Your Health Idaho Executive Director Pat Kelly said in an interview last week.
“Last year, we saw more than half of our enrollment occurred in the last seven days of open enrollment, and a third of that occurs on the very last day. So it’s always a little bit hard to tell where we will ultimately end up until we are completely done with open enrollment,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun.
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate is expected to vote on a bill by Democrats that would extend the enhanced premium tax credits for three years. But the bill likely doesn’t have enough bipartisan support to pass, States Newsroom reported. 
In Idaho, Kelly expects 25,000 people will cancel their policies if the subsidies aren’t renewed. About 87% of the roughly 116,000 Idahoans who have insurance through the state exchange get the enhanced tax credits, according to a report by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The enhanced premium tax credits ensure people don’t pay more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance for benchmark plans.

Almost 60% of Americans enrolled in health insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces say they can’t afford a $300 annual rise in their premiums, a poll released last week by the nonpartisan health organization KFF found. 
The federal government shut down after a health care clash. In Idaho, the stakes are high.

The premium prices on Your Health Idaho for health insurance plans assume that the tax credits will expire, Kelly said. Already, he said, there are signs that affordability is a big concern for Idahoans as people are downgrading plan types, more people disenrolling citing affordability as the reason, and agents and brokers saying clients are trying to wait to see what happens.
But he’s encouraging Idahoans to not wait, and instead enroll now.
“We’re encouraging agents to ensure that their clients enroll in a plan that works for their budget today and, of course, meets their medical needs — knowing that if things change, we’ll make sure that they have an opportunity to receive all the savings that they’re eligible for,” Kelly said. “And of course, if that means an opportunity to change plans or enroll, we would certainly do everything we can to make that available to Idahoans.”
 How to get help enrolling in insurance through Your Health Idaho

There are several resources to get help enrolling in health insurance plans through Your Health Idaho, including:

Calling customer support at Your Health Idaho at 855-944-3246. The line is staffed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday. 
Finding an agent or broker online. 
Finding an enrollment event near you online.
Using an affordability calculator online to explore plans. 

 How much are premiums rising?

Here’s a few examples of how Idaho households could be affected, based on estimates from Your Health Idaho:

A family of four that earns $130,000 a year would see their annual premiums rise by $10,831 a year. Because they earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, they wouldn’t be eligible for tax credits if the enhanced credits expire. Losing tax credits would cost them $7,800 a year, and their separate premium raise would cost them another $3,031 a year. 
A couple that earns $85,000 a year would see their premiums jump by $18,600 a year. They’d also lose credits, because they earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, which is the cutoff for the smaller tax credits created through the Affordable Care Act.

But on one recent Saturday, owner Juan Castelan gestured in the direction of mostly empty tables.  
Business is down 30% to 40% since the Memphis Safe Task Force began making thousands of traffic stops and arrests for alleged criminal and immigration law violations in September. 
Castelan has had to cut hours for his full-time kitchen and waitstaff to 25 or 28 per week, from 40.
It is common to hear sirens and witness federal and state officers conducting traffic stops and making arrests multiple times a day through the restaurant’s floor-to-ceiling windows, he said.
Business is down more than 30% at La Guadalupana since th Memphis Safe Task Force arrived, said owner Juan Castelan (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“The Hispanic community just sees all these police and says, ‘OK, nobody else is going outside’ so they just stay home,” he said. 
Across town on Beale Street, the city’s neon-lit entertainment district, blues bars and Memphis barbecue restaurants sat near empty at 9 p.m. on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. 
“I work on Beale Street and it is dead,” said Joe Calhoun, who operates the Withers Collection Museum, a designated landmark on the U.S. Civil Rights Trail.
Calhoun said museum attendance has been down since January due to a perception of crime in Memphis, the impetus cited in a presidential memo establishing the task for to restore “law and order” to the city through “hypervigilant policing” 
But the constant presence of Tennessee National Guard patrolling Beale Street and news coverage of arrests is deterring visitors, he said.
Attendance at the museum has dropped as much as 50% this fall as foot traffic dwindled even further along the three-block entertainment district.
“Everyone, unilaterally, is saying business is flat.” said Calhoun, a member of the Beale Street Merchants Association.
The Task Force is having a similar economic impact on local businesses as the COVID pandemic, said Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, who is challenging the constitutionality of the Guard deployment in court.
“Nobody is going downtown right now with all of this going on,” Harris said. “I mean it’s tough for people to justify going to Target, when you’ve got men in military fatigues protecting Target, and I guess I put protection in quotation marks.”
Harris said the chilling effect of the Task Force presence has extended to attendance at many public activities, particularly for Memphis’ Latino community, he said. 
“Everyone is just waiting and hoping that some of this dragnet reduces so they can go out, particularly Latino communities. Latino communities are frozen,” he said. 
“People can’t go to church; people can’t go to the extracurricular activities for their children…People in some cases are afraid to go look for a job because they’re afraid they might get caught up in a dragnet.”
Supporters of the Task Force, including Gov. Bill Lee and Republican lawmakers, have touted its success in taking criminals off the streets.

Data released by the Task Force shows 3500 arrests and over 39,000 traffic stops since it began operations in late September.
“This is how we restore law and order in Memphis,” said Sen. Brent Taylor, a Republican representing parts of Shelby County, said last week, citing a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report confirming crime in Memphis was at a 25-year low before the Task Force operation began. 
The Task Force presence has stressed small business owners in other ways, said Mauricio Calvo, president and CEO of Latino Memphis. 
Calvo and his colleagues now routinely see Tennessee Highway Patrol cars and dark SUVs driven by federal immigration agents parked outside a popular Mexican restaurant across the street from their office. 
“The first time it happened, it really freaked us out,” said Calvo who, along with a staff immigration attorney, rushed to the restaurant to provide legal aid to restaurant workers.

It soon became apparent that the law enforcement officials were dining at the restaurant, not making arrests. 
Memphis restaurants have been called out on social media and threatened with boycotts for serving meals to Task Force members, but Calvo said owners he has spoken to feel they have no choice: refusing service could make them a target of the Task Force.
“It is such a humiliating thing,” serving Task Force members, he said. “I mean, I wish they could understand what this means to the workers there, to the people, to us as a community.”
Restaurants, retail, construction and other sectors have also contended with workers unwilling to come to work for fear they could be detained, he said.
“This may sound stereotypical, but Latinos are an important part of the essential workers, construction workers, landscaping, hospitality, where people are not showing up to work right now,” he said.
Calhoun, the Beale Street museum operator, said he has had to accommodate the heightened concern of his own staff.
“My maintenance people and my housekeepers are Hispanic. They’re afraid to come to work. They will only come to work in the middle of the day because they’re afraid to come at night.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Columbia’s City Council is considering a bill that would raise water rates up to 20% per year for five years to pay for a new, more drought- and disaster-resistant intake from the Duck River and a water treatment plant.
The rate increase would affect Columbia Power and Water System’s 27,000 customers, and would impact customers of other nearby water systems that purchase water from Columbia Power and Water Systems. Columbia’s water utility currently sells water wholesale to systems in Maury County, Spring Hill, Mount Pleasant, which serve roughly 35,000 customers combined.
Columbia Power and Water Systems also requested the City Council increase its water impact fee, a fee paid by new water customers to help cover the costs associated with increased demand.
The rate and impact fee increases would allow Columbia’s water utility to secure federal and state low-interest, long term loans needed to finance the majority of the $520 million project. Those loans require substantial “stress tests” to ensure the utility will be able to pay back the funds in a timely manner, Columbia Power and Water Systems President and CEO Jonathan Hardin said, so anticipated growth in the utility’s customer base and increased income from higher new customer impact fees can’t be considered in the loan process. 










What we see here today is the opposite: existing ratepayers being asked to subsidize decades of unplanned, uncoordinated, reactive growth … Now, what we’re facing is a plan that puts more straws into the Duck River, a river that’s already under stress.


– Gabe Howard, Columbia City Council


Several members of the public, including Maury County commissioners who spoke about the potential impact to their constituents, urged the council to pause and consider any other options that would place less burden on citizens, particularly those on fixed incomes.
Gabe Howard, who represents District 8 on the Maury County Commission, said he supports the higher impact fee proposal, but that the fee should have been raised years ago to better distribute the costs of system expansion among those that contributed to increased demand.
“We say often that growth should pay for growth, but the fact is, it doesn’t, and it never has,” Howard said. “What we see here today is the opposite: existing ratepayers being asked to subsidize decades of unplanned, uncoordinated, reactive growth … Now, what we’re facing is a plan that puts more straws into the Duck River, a river that’s already under stress.”
Howard said the compounded effect of an annual 20% rate increase would add up to 150% over five years — an “unprecedented … heavy burden” for Maury County’s families, farmers and small businesses.
Water wars: groups challenge ‘unsustainable’ withdrawals from Duck River

“Yes, this increase on a percentage basis is high,” Hardin said, but the 20% per year rate increase represents a worst-case scenario.
“Every dollar we actually do collect (from impact fees and growth) will directly reduce rate needs, and we expect to see lower-percentage increases in years three, four and five,” he said.
Vice Mayor Randy McBroom said Columbia Power and Water System would have to come to the council every year with an independent study to set the annual rate increase.
The council reviewed the proposals during a study session on Thursday, ahead of the bills’ first consideration on Dec. 10. Public hearings for the bills would be scheduled for Jan. 8, 2026.
Should the project’s funding plan be approved in January, work would begin in Spring 2026 and complete around summer 2029.
Water woes
Columbia Power and Water System draws its water supply from the Duck River, a scenic river packed with ecological diversity that also serves as the main water source for the fast-growing southern Middle Tennessee region. But droughts and increasing demand for larger water withdrawals have put additional stress on the river. 
Gov. Bill Lee issued an executive order in November 2024 creating an advisory group tasked with identifying ways to protect the river while addressing water needs. The group issued its first recommendations last month, including a feasibility study for a pipeline to the Tennessee River and raising the level of the reservoir created by the Normandy Dam to collect more water during the wet seasons. 
Plans for the new intake site and treatment plant have been underway for a decade, Hardin said.
The Tennessee Valley Authority first issued a report citing the need for a downstream intake to meet the growing region’s water needs in 2001, Hardin said. The Duck River Agency echoed this finding in a 2011 report.
Columbia Power and Water System’s current intake withdraws up to 20 million gallons of water per day from the Duck River at the Riverside Drive intake. The proposed project would move the intake location downstream, and increase the utility’s withdrawal to up to 32 million gallons of water per day.
Hardin recounted the detrimental effects of severe droughts in 1988 and between 2007 and 2008. The Riverside Drive intake also relies on the Riverside Dam, a concrete structure erected in the 1920s that is “nearing the end of its useful life,” he said. 
Environmental group calls for water conservation as drought saps Duck River

Extreme rain events like Hurricane Helene also put the dam at risk of failure, Hardin added. Relocating the intake downstream “to a location that would prove capable and resilient during a 1988 drought event, while protecting the sensitive Duck River ecology” would address those problems, he said.
Permits for the project have already been approved by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the project received a favorable biological opinion from the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency in March. Columbia Power and Water Systems began acquiring the land easements necessary for the project soon after, and have since secured about 60%. The remaining easements should be secured by Jan. 1, Hardin said.
Jason Gilliam — chair of the Maury County Republican Party, a member of the Maury County Water System Board, and a leader of a group advocating for the construction of a new dam in Columbia — urged the council to consider postponing the decision while others consider alternate ways to source water. Gilliam cited a proposed expansion of an ongoing pipeline project from H.B. & T.S. Utility District in Williamson County.
Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder said his overarching question is the cost of inaction. 
Should the rate increase not pass council approval, Hardin said the utility would serve the “modest amount of excess capacity” it maintains to developers who were first in line until it hits the 20 million gallon per day cap. After that, the utility would not be able to serve any additional water needs.
“For the interest of public health and safety, we would lock everything in place, and we would maintain the status quo,” Hardin said. The utility would “certainly revisit our wholesale obligations, and somebody like Spring Hill who has other options available to them would not receive the same priority as an entity that only gets the water directly (from Columbia Power and Water Systems).”

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Democratic state Sen. Julie Gonzales on Monday announced she is running to unseat U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper in 2026, aiming to ride a wave of liberal and progressive dissatisfaction with Democratic leadership to an upset primary victory.
Gonzales’ announcement, rumored for weeks, sets up a clash in Colorado between a leading progressive voice at the state Legislature and a business-friendly moderate who has been a fixture in Colorado politics for roughly three decades.
In an interview, Gonzales called the 2026 midterm elections “a defining moment for the future of the Democratic Party.”
“What sort of party do we want to be?” Gonzales said. “Do we want to send back John Hickenlooper, a go-along-to-get-along incrementalist, or do we want to send a proven legislator, with a track record of taking on big fights against a well-funded corporate lobby, who’s gotten s*** done?”

Gonzales said Hickenlooper has failed to offer a “bold and fierce critique” of President Donald Trump’s second term agenda, faulting him for his votes earlier this year to confirm many of Trump’s Cabinet appointees. The path forward for Democrats after a bitter defeat in the 2024 election, she argued, is to embrace “policies that will have transformative impacts on everyday working people’s lives,” like “Medicare for All” and universal child care.
“The work begins day one, to remind folks that we can actually have nice things — you just need people willing to fight for them,” Gonzales said. “We have the opportunity to get the profit motive out of our health care system, and to enact universal health care. We have the opportunity to enact universal care for children, for elders. It requires us to reassess our policy priorities.”
Hickenlooper, a former brewpub entrepreneur and real estate developer, was elected mayor of Denver in 2003 and served two terms as Colorado governor beginning in 2011. During an ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign, he insisted he was “not cut out to be a senator,” but months later acquiesced to party leadership’s efforts to recruit him to challenge former GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, whom he went on to defeat soundly to help Democrats capture a razor-thin Senate majority.
Hickenlooper was among a group of 22 Democrats and Republicans who crafted the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, championing provisions to expand broadband access and boost investment in electric vehicle charging stations, and he was credited by activists with keeping alive the negotiations that ultimately led to Democrats’ passage of billions in spending to fight climate change in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
He would be 80 years old by the end of another six-year Senate term, which he has said would be his last. In an interview with 9News in April, Hickenlooper said that while he had considered passing the torch to a new generation, his breadth of experience as a mayor, a governor and a small business owner brings a “unique and valuable perspective to making decisions.”

The winner of the June 30 Democratic Senate primary will be heavily favored to win in the general election in November. Republicans have not won a statewide race in Colorado since 2016. Historical precedent, early polling data and special election results this year all suggest the party faces strong headwinds in the 2026 midterms. Two little-known Republican U.S. Senate candidates, former state Rep. Janak Joshi and Marine Corps veteran George Markert, have raised a combined total of about $267,000 in campaign contributions, less than one-tenth of the $3.6 million war chest that Hickenlooper reported at the end of September, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures.
Gonzales, who began her career as a community organizer before running for the state Senate in 2018, expects much of that financial firepower to now be directed at her.
“I expect them to throw everything that they’ve got at me, but that’s not going to stop me. I have never backed down from a fight,” she said. “We might not outraise John Hickenlooper — we’ll sure as hell outwork him.”
Calls for generational change
It’s extremely rare for a sitting U.S. senator to be unseated by a primary challenge, though that rarity is a relatively recent development.
In 18 regularly scheduled elections between 1946 and 1980, a total of 36 Senate incumbents were defeated in primary elections, according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution. But in the 22 federal elections held since then, it’s happened just eight times. The last senator to suffer such a fate was former GOP Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana in 2012.
Gonzales’ Senate bid is more than just a challenge to Hickenlooper — it’s a breach of protocol within a Democratic Party that has, both at the national level and in Colorado specifically, placed a heavy premium on deference to seniority and the appearance of party comity.
Colorado’s strong Democratic bench includes three rising-star U.S. House members in their forties and plenty of prominent up-and-comers at the state and local levels. But twice in recent years — in Hickenlooper’s switch to the 2020 Senate race, and fellow U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet’s unexpected run for governor in 2026 — a decision by a more senior party figure has largely cleared the field and put an end to announced and rumored candidacies by younger hopefuls.
Gonzales, 42, would be the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Colorado, and the first Latina elected to any statewide office.
“I’ve worked hard, and I’ve followed all the rules — but I am not willing to sit around and wait for the boys’ club to say, now it’s time for a woman to run,” she said.
Calls for generational change within the Democratic Party have grown louder in the wake of a 2024 election loss widely attributed to former President Joe Biden’s failure to withdraw from the race earlier than he did. Criticism of the party’s “gerontocracy” may have reached a tipping point in 2025, a year during which three Democratic U.S. House members died in office — leaving their seats empty at a time when the GOP majority advanced its sweeping tax and spending bill by a one-vote margin.
At least three longtime House Democrats — former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois — announced their retirements in recent months after drawing young primary challengers who voiced explicit concerns about their ages. In Massachusetts, 79-year-old Sen. Ed Markey faces a primary challenge from 47-year-old Rep. Seth Moulton, and in Maine, polls show first-time candidate Graham Platner, 41, with an early advantage over two-term incumbent Gov. Janet Mills, party leadership’s pick to take on GOP Sen. Susan Collins.
Three other lesser-known Democratic candidates — attorney Karen Breslin, software engineer Brashad Hasley and accountant A.J. Zimpfer — have also formally filed to run against Hickenlooper. To qualify for the Senate primary ballot, candidates can either submit 12,000 valid petition signatures by March 18 or win support from at least 30% of delegates at the 2026 state party assembly, scheduled for March 28 in Pueblo.
“I’ve seen hundreds of thousands of Coloradans take to the streets to proclaim ‘No Kings,'” Gonzales said, referring to this year’s nationwide anti-Trump demonstrations. “There is no guarantee for any elected official — you have to earn those votes. I think that when primary voters in Colorado have the opportunity to weigh in about the future of the leadership that they want representing them in Washington, D.C., they will support my candidacy.”
Different political eras
Gonzales said she first seriously considered a Senate bid during a special legislative session in August, when Colorado lawmakers were called back to the Capitol to close a billion-dollar budget gap triggered by congressional Republicans’ passage of their tax and spending law.
After two four-year terms representing Senate District 34, which includes much of north, west and downtown Denver, Gonzales is term-limited in 2026. She currently serves as chair of the Senate Judiciary and Ethics committees. Her proudest legislative accomplishments, she said, include sponsoring the Reproductive Health Equity Act, an abortion-rights law passed before the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade, and two immigrants rights bills — House Bill 19-1124 and Senate Bill 25-276 — that she said helped protect Colorado from overreach by Trump’s immigration authorities.
“Both are times when (some) Democrats — some of my more moderate colleagues, some of my more incrementalist colleagues — would say, ‘This is a lot. This is too hard to do,'” Gonzales said.
As governor, Hickenlooper presided over a much different era of state politics — one in which Republicans frequently controlled at least one chamber of the Legislature, along with the offices of attorney general and secretary of state. His moderate stances often frustrated many within his party, especially when it came to energy and environmental issues, which roiled the state during the 2010s fracking boom that coincided with his governorship.
An August poll by Magellan Strategies found that 49% of Coloradans disapproved of Hickenlooper’s job performance, compared to 37% who approved. A separate poll found that his favorability rating had declined to 43% last month from 49% in March.
Colorado’s increasing Democratic lean has made Hickenlooper an outlier in the Senate, a Newsline analysis found earlier this year. During the first three months of 2025, he voted with Trump and Republicans nearly 30% of the time despite representing a state that voted against Trump by 11 percentage points. No other Democratic senator had a voting record that was more at odds with their state’s partisan vote share.
After years of community organizing work, Gonzales won the District 34 primary in 2018 with 64% of the vote, after winning endorsements from progressive groups including the Working Families Party and the Denver Democratic Socialists of America. She joined the DSA in 2018, because they were “engaging young people in a manner that I hadn’t seen take place in years,” she said, though her membership has since lapsed. She cited New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s victory last month, however, along with wins for progressives at the local level in Colorado, as evidence that Democrats need to propose policy solutions that “meet the scale of the problems that we face.”
“Across the country, we saw progressives who led with their values, and who were unapologetic about being fighters for the working class, win,” Gonzales said.
It’s the same lesson that she takes from her tenure in the Legislature, where Democrats, despite frequent predictions of a backlash from voters, have been able to build durable majorities in both the House and Senate.
“Colorado is a blue state, and at the state Capitol, we have led,” Gonzales said. “We need that same type of partner in Washington, D.C., who is willing to be bold, unapologetic and relentless — and I’ve done that my entire career.”

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Some North Dakota farmers are owed money after a large bankruptcy filing by a Nebraska-based grain dealer. 
The North Dakota Department of Agriculture says farmers in the state are owed more than $900,000 by the Hansen-Mueller Co. 
The bankruptcy affects creditors in multiple states, including South Dakota and Minnesota. Creditors also include a trucking company in North Dakota.
David Barrett is a Bismarck ag law attorney with clients that include some of the North Dakota farmers who will be filing claims. 
He has clients in other states, too, and has already filed a $1.2 million claim for a grain elevator in Mississippi.

“There’s creditors everywhere,” Barrett said, with more filings to come. 
Hansen-Mueller leases a grain storage facility in Grand Forks and has a roving grain buyers license in the state. As part of being licensed in the state, it also would have to secure a bond to help ensure it can pay for grain it has purchased. 
However, the company filed for bankruptcy Nov. 17, before the Department of Agriculture could begin insolvency proceedings. Those proceedings could have allowed the state to access the company’s bond to help repay farmers.
Shaun Quissell, director of the Grain and Livestock Division for the state Ag Department, said Hansen-Mueller was bonded for about $778,000 — less than what is owed. 
The state also has a credit sales indemnity fund, which helps protect farmers from fraudulent buyers. 
Quissell also said the grain purchase agreements between Hansen-Mueller and the farmers were not credit sales contracts and would not have been covered by that fund. 
Because the company declared bankruptcy, the bond money could become part of the bankruptcy proceeding, Quissell said. 
Most of the North Dakota transactions involved oats, Quissell said. He did not have information on how many growers were affected. 
Barrett said the farmers he’s aware of being owed money are in the Red River Valley. 
In a news release, state Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring encouraged farmers affected by the Hansen-Mueller bankruptcy to file claims with the bankruptcy court. 
“Every producer who is owed money by Hansen-Mueller should be receiving notification from the bankruptcy court that they are a claimant and need to file a claim,” Goehring said. “We understand the producer’s frustration and are here to provide clear information to help those affected.”
Bankruptcy information can be found at https://dm.epiq11.com/case/hansenmueller/info or by calling 877-717-1702.  
In a news release announcing the bankruptcy, Hansen-Mueller said it hoped to find a buyer to continue operations. 
Hansen-Mueller operates nine grain elevators, including five across the Midwest along Interstate 29. Its Minnesota operations include a facility at the Duluth port on Lake Superior.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The vote total for state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the Tennessee 7th Congressional District race against now-U.S. Rep. Matt Van Epps show Democrats have narrowed their deficit to Republicans but not enough to flip any seats, an analysis of election data by the Lookout finds.
The racet to watch in the 2026 election is Tennessee Congressional District 5, currently held by Columbia Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles. He’s won about 56% of the vote in the past two elections, the lowest of any Tennessee Republican who won their U.S. House race.
Behn performed better in every county in District 7 in 2025 when compared to the Democratic candidates in 2024 or 2022. But if the same shifts in Nashville, Williamson County and rural counties that happened in District 7 on the Dec. 2 special election occurred in the 5th district, the Democratic candidate would lose by 4 to 7 percentage points.
Kent Syler, a political science professor at Middle Tennessee State University, said based on his look at the election data, he came up with a similar number, but cautioned that the 2026 midterms are still 11 months away and a lot could happen.
“The biggest issue will be President Donald Trump’s popularity,” Syler said. “Midterms are always about the President.”
President Donald Trump’s approval rating is 36%, according to Gallup.
Trump’s approval rating is at its lowest since he returned to office in January, driven down by many voters who disapprove of the President’s handling of the economy and inflation.
In 2022, state Republicans redrew Tennessee’s U.S. Congressional map, dividing Nashville across three districts and successfully eliminating a Democratic-held seat in the old version of the 5th Distric — a seat held by Democrats from post-Reconstruction until Ogles’ 2022 election.
By cracking the district, Republicans narrowed their margins in districts 5, 6 and 7, which political analysts warned could make two of those districts competitive in a bad electoral year for Republicans.
U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles won’t run away from his association with President Donald Trump even if Trump’s popularity continues to decline, one expert predicts. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“The shift we saw in the 7th district is the same one we saw in New Jersey and Virginia earlier this year,” said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. “All the Republicans should be fearful.”
During the campaign, both candidates ran on affordability, recognizing that the cost of living has become a top priority for voters.
Van Epps madeclear during his election night speech that he didn’t blame Trump for economic issues and believed the president’s support in his race boosted his chances of winning.
“Tonight, you sent a clear message loud and clear,” Van Epps said. “The people of Middle Tennessee stand proudly behind President Donald Trump.”
Geer said Van Epps’ praise of Trump showed a potential problem for Republicans. To win close elections in 2026, candidates might need to separate themselves from the president, but “Trump won’t let them.”
“Ogles definitely won’t run away from Trump,” Geer said.

Stebbins
We are told we face a difficult choice: protect our water or secure our energy. This is a false narrative, manufactured by a foreign corporation and its allies to disguise their illegal occupation of our Great Lakes. The real choice before us, and the urgent duty before our state officials, is between upholding the law or capitulating to corporate power.
My remarks are directed to those in Lansing with the power to act.
An orderly, planned shutdown of Line 5 is not a concession; it is an affirmation. It is how we uphold the laws that protect the Public Trust Doctrine enshrined in our state constitution. It is how we defend state sovereignty by enforcing our Governor’s valid revocation of an easement that a corporation continues to violate with impunity. It is how we honor Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, respecting the original stewards of these waters whose survival and culture are non-negotiable.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Critically, moving forward with a shutdown is how we boost jobs and domestic energy security. Since the Snyder administration, studies have confirmed that alternatives exist, but corporate greed has blinded our decision makers. Shutting Line 5 means investing in Michigan labor to build and maintain modern, safer energy infrastructure, not relying on a 70-year-old line in the heart of our Straits to send Canadian oil to foreign markets. True energy independence is built on innovation and resilience, not on doubling down on a risky, outdated conduit.
Yet, we are trapped in a cycle of unreasonable court delays, a strategy employed by Enbridge to run out the clock and amplify their threats to our communities. Every day our state wavers in its political will to enforce its own laws is a day we normalize this illegality.
This moment sets a national precedent. If Michigan, surrounded by the world’s greatest freshwater system, cannot summon the courage to prioritize the Great Lakes over a Canadian oil giant’s profits, what state can? We are signaling to every corporation that they can defy environmental orders, manipulate legal systems, and place their infrastructure above the public interest. As a wave of data centers enters the chat, Enbridge is paving their way for lawlessness. We are telling our citizens and Tribal nations that their rights are secondary to corporate convenience.
We do not need more grandstanding. We need the bold leadership that was promised when the shutdown was ordered. We need leaders who see that enforcing the law is the pro-jobs, pro-sovereignty, and pro-American energy path.
The call is clear. Use every tool of State government to end this illegal occupation and manage a transition that protects our water and our workers. Demonstrate to the nation that when the health of the Great Lakes and the rule of law are at stake, Michigan will lead.
Our Great Lakes are not a bargaining chip. They are the foundation of our identity, economy, and future. Upholding the law to protect them isn’t a threat to our prosperity, it is its very source.
The political will to act now is the only leadership worthy of this moment and this magnificent trust.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The two candidates for next chief justice of the North Dakota Supreme Court have a vision for a better-resourced and more efficient judiciary.
Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Jerod Tufte are vying for the role after Jon Jensen announced last month he will step down at the end of 2025.
The chief justice is selected by a vote of the Supreme Court and state district court judges. 
The court system will count the ballots and announce a winner Wednesday.
The chief justice is responsible for handling some court-related administrative duties, in addition to serving as the public face of North Dakota’s judicial system. The chief has no more voting power on the court than the other justices.
“The description that has been used over the years is, the chief justice is the leader among equals,” Jensen said.
This is Tufte’s first time running for chief justice. Fair McEvers previously sought the position in 2019.

Fair McEvers
Fair McEvers said her career in the North Dakota court system dates back to 1987, when she began working in court administration for the Northeast Judicial District.
“I kind of know the history going back a long ways,” she said of the state’s judiciary.
Fair McEvers said the job sparked her interest in the law and inspired her to become an attorney. She graduated from the University of North Dakota Law School in 1997.
She went on to serve as assistant state’s attorney for Cass County and commissioner of the North Dakota Department of Labor from 2005 to 2010. Fair McEvers then served as a judge in the East Central Judicial District in Fargo.
She became a justice in 2014 when she was appointed by former Gov. Jack Dalrymple to fill a vacancy left by former Justice Mary Muehlen Maring. Fair McEvers was then elected to the court to serve a two-year term in 2016 and a 10-year term in 2018.
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

Fair McEvers is the fourth woman to serve on the North Dakota Supreme Court. She said one of the most gratifying parts of her job is being a role model to young people.
“I want people to see that women can do this job and do it well,” Fair McEvers said.
If elected chief justice, she said she would look for ways to increase resources for district court judges.
“I know how busy they are, and how hard it is to find time to write the opinions and do the research and do all that by yourself,” Fair McEvers said.
One of her priorities would be eliminating judicial referee positions in state courts, she said. Judicial referees are attorneys that are available to decide certain cases — including juvenile, small claims and traffic court cases — on behalf of district court judges. There are five in the state.
Fair McEvers said she thinks the court system should invest in more judge positions rather than  continuing to keep judicial referees part of the court system.
“The judicial referees are very good, don’t get me wrong, but folks have a right to have their case heard by a district judge,” she said.
She said she wouldn’t want to take anyone’s job away, but would support phasing the referee positions out gradually.

Tufte 
Before he became an attorney, Tufte was a software engineer. After graduating from Arizona State University College of Law in 2002, he worked on patent and licensing issues for tech companies, he said.
Tufte also clerked for a judge on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and was the state’s attorney for Kidder County and Sheridan County. He served as legal counsel for Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple from 2011 to 2014, and went on to become a judge in the Southeast Judicial District in Valley City.
Tufte was elected to the Supreme Court in 2016.
He described himself as an admirer of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, particularly Thomas’ belief that the U.S. Constitution should be interpreted based on how its authors would have understood it at the time of its adoption. The legal theory, often referred to as “originalism,” has been invoked by Thomas and other conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices in landmark decisions like the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.
“He’s just got this courage to admit that maybe the court’s been wrong from time to time,” Tufte said of Thomas.
Tufte said one of his objectives is to empower the court system to experiment with artificial intelligence.
He chairs the North Dakota judiciary’s artificial intelligence task force, and said he would want to continue in that position if elected chief justice. He’s also on a task force that’s exploring ways  to address North Dakota’s shortage of lawyers.
Tufte said his experience in the governor’s office would help the court collaborate with other branches of government to achieve its policy goals.
“The chief justice needs to be able to build bridges with different factions,” he said. “That’s what I bring to the table.”
Both Fair McEvers and Tufte said they would continue many initiatives started under Jensen’s leadership, including the ongoing effort to make all clerks of court state employees. Some clerks are still county employees, a holdover from when county courts and district courts were separate. The courts merged in the 1990s.
Fair McEvers and Tufte took opposing views on the court’s recent 3-2 decision on the state’s near-total abortion ban. The majority opinion, which Fair McEvers joined, found the law unconstitutional. Tufte authored the dissenting opinion. Since it takes a vote of four justices to declare a law unconstitutional, the law was upheld.

Jensen
Jensen’s predecessors, former justices Gerald VandeWalle and Ralph Erickstad, served as chief justice for a combined 45 years. Their decades-long service was unusual, however, Jensen said. He said before their terms as chief, the position “rotated fairly frequently.”
Most of the chief’s work pertains to “day-to-day management issues,” Jensen said. The chief justice typically decides minor legal matters that don’t need to go before the full court, for instance, and is also responsible for appointments to some committees and work groups, he said.
North Dakota Supreme Court Justice Daniel Crothers announces retirement

The chief represents the judicial system on special occasions, including delivering the state of the judiciary address at each legislative session.
“The role of chief justice can be as easy or hard as the chief justice wants it to be,” Jensen said. “You can take on challenges to improve the judicial system, or alternatively, you can sit in the ceremonial role.”
He noted in a letter announcing his resignation that the court system has added three new judges and 29 full-time employees under his tenure, in addition to working to increase district judge salaries.
Jensen said part of the reason he’s not seeking reelection is because he wants to spend more time with his family. He felt it was time to yield the role to someone who can commit more energy to it, he said. Jensen will continue serving as a justice.
“I really do believe that if you’re in a position of leadership, you need to use that leadership to make whatever you’re leading better,” Jensen said.

When a woman sits across from me in the exam room, she’s not thinking about politics. She’s thinking about how to survive her work day without severe cramps, how to manage her bleeding so she can attend class without mishap, or how to avoid threatening her life with another high-risk pregnancy. 
These situations are only a few of the reasons why the news about abandoned U.S.–funded contraceptives overseas is so alarming. This action blatantly reflects the same disregard for women’s health that now shapes national policy. And that disregard lands directly on women’s bodies. 
Under the Trump administration, the U.S. government ordered the destruction of nearly $10 million worth of U.S.–funded contraceptives, based on the false claim that birth control is an “abortifacient.” This claim is absolutely nonsensical. Contraception doesn’t end a pregnancy — it prevents one. Unfortunately, ideology, and not medicine, guided that decision, leaving lifesaving, taxpayer‑funded medicine stalled in warehouses instead of reaching women who need it. 
The full picture is even more disturbing. Several days ago, a new report found that the Trump administration left 20 of 24 U.S.–funded contraceptive shipments to waste away in Belgian warehouses. These were fully paid-for, taxpayer-funded supplies — IUDs, implants, pills, and other reproductive health essentials — intended for women in 13 countries. This is simply appalling. 
And if you think that kind of extremism stops at the water’s edge, think again. 
Back home, I see the fallout of the same ideology driving national attacks on contraception and women. 
Already, there are over 300,000 women of reproductive age in Wisconsin in need of contraception, and attacks are making this gap even worse. 
And these gaps carry real health risks, because contraception does more than prevent pregnancy — it treats endometriosis, PCOS, severe bleeding and anemia, and it reduces the risk of reproductive cancers. 
Rural clinics that once offered contraception and family-planning visits have declined in number, a trend worsened by federal policy shifts that weaken the reproductive-health safety net and leave too many women without reliable nearby options for care.
And now, with health-insurance costs already skyrocketing for many families — and monthly bills set to jump even higher if those tax credits expire — the ACA’s no-cost contraception guarantee slips further out of reach. Road block after road block after road block. 
Fortunately, Wisconsin has leaders who understand the stakes. 
Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s leadership on the “Right to Contraception Act” reflects a truth every OB‑GYN knows: contraception saves lives. Contraception reduces maternal deaths, prevents unintended pregnancies, treats reproductive-health conditions, and empowers women to build stable lives. Baldwin fights to protect contraception — what Wisconsin women rely on every day — not because it’s politically convenient, but because she understands it’s a medical necessity. 
U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan co-sponsored the “Saving Lives and Taxpayer Dollars Act” — legislation designed to stop exactly what we’re seeing in Belgium. The bill requires that U.S.–funded food and medical supplies – like the contraception sitting in Brussels at this moment – reach the people they were purchased for, instead of being left to rot or destroyed for ideological reasons. In Washington, where too many have decided contraception is a cultural wedge rather than essential health care, Pocan’s voice matters. 
The women I see in my exam room aren’t looking for a political fight. They’re looking for care that lets them stay healthy, stay safe, and stay in control of their lives — something contraception makes possible every day. 
Jeopardizing contraception — whether through wasteful negligence abroad or political interference here at home — is harmful, cruel and simply unjust. 
We in Wisconsin cannot afford to look the other way. We need leaders who will defend the right to contraception, not undermine it. 
The stakes are simple: either we protect access to basic health care, or we allow ideology to decide who gets care — and who doesn’t. 
For the women in my clinic — and for women everywhere — contraception is essential care that strengthens their health and safeguards their freedom.

(Getty Images)It is startling to realize the eight professions the U.S. Department of Education recently announced it wants to reclassify as nonprofessional include nurses and teachers.
If reclassified, it will reduce the amount of student loans for those seeking advanced degrees. The other professions are audiologists, speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, social workers, public health and counseling therapy. Health care in states like Idaho will be seriously damaged.
One of the interesting things about all these professions is they all require licensing and continuing education hours, adding educational costs beyond a bachelor’s or master’s.
If approved, it means these workers will have a lifetime federal student loan cap of $200,000. This will make degrees including advanced certifications or a doctorate unavailable to thousands of people.
Many bachelor’s degrees now cost a minimum of $30,000 for public college in-state tuition, $63,000 for private colleges or out-of-state tuition. The average master’s degree costs $65,000 for public schools, $88,000 for private universities; so, a $200,000 lifetime cap places further education beyond the grasp of many Americans. This is especially true of these eight professions where continuing education is essential — even required as a condition of employment — to maintain and gain necessary skills.
Because of the proposed student loan cutback, it may mean a serious shortage of people to fill jobs in health care and education, making American less healthy and more poorly educated.
For example, in rural areas throughout America, nurses who have completed nurse practitioner certification (an advanced degree) are serving rural areas where physicians are either in short supply or nonexistent. Without these professionals, people have limited ability to receive medical care without significant travel.
This also comes at a time when there is a serious shortage of nurses in the U.S., with both Washington and Idaho facing significant shortfalls in nursing care. In Washington, there is a 26 percent shortage of nurses and a 15 percent shortage in Idaho.
However, if the current trend continues, Idaho is projected by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to have the most serious shortage of nurses in the country by next year with a projected 62 percent of the necessary skilled nurses working. This would be a 38 percent shortfall of nurses needed.
The same is true of education with more than 411,000 K-12 teaching positions vacant and more than 1 in 8 teaching positions currently filled by uncertified teachers across the country. The shortage is especially serious in areas of high poverty with 86 percent of the nation’s school districts struggling to fill positions. In the 2023-24 school year, the Idaho Department of Education reported serious teacher shortages in elementary grades K-8, math, science, technical and career education, visual and performing arts, family and consumer science and special education.
Who will be hurt the most by these actions? Mostly people in rural areas, but everywhere it will primarily impact children, women and the elderly. If someone has a serious health issue or they want to climb out of poverty through education, they will struggle to find resources.
As a medical example, anyone who might need a hearing aid – sure, they can get one over the counter, but one that specifically addresses their unique need if they are profoundly deaf or have tinnitus? For that, they need an audiologist.
Someone who experienced a stroke and needs to re-learn how to do daily activities needs an occupational therapist. Social workers do more than deal with families, they also help vulnerable people find assistance such as housing and mental health treatment. Public health professionals create awareness of public health issues, such as illness or the dangers of certain behaviors.
When it comes to the people driven to serve in these areas as professionals, it will be women and people of color who are the majority of all these impacted groups. Changing the ability of people to serve their communities by removing advanced scholastic opportunities makes no sense.
Overall, what this plan will most likely do is decrease the already short supply of nurses, teachers, audiologist, therapists, social workers and public health professionals hurting Americans ability to be educated and healthy.
Reportedly, the U.S. Department of Education will hold hearing next year on the topic, and concerned citizens should let their opinions on this revocation of professional status be known to the Department of Education and others.

Ken Fleming is filing legislation in 2026 that would remove body mass index from treatment standards for state qualified health insurance plans marketed through kynect. (LRC Public Information)This story discusses eating disorders. If you or someone you know is at risk for an eating disorder, the National Eating Disorders Association has resources and a free screening tool at www.nationaleatingdisorders.org The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. 
Kentuckians being treated for eating disorders who gain much needed weight in treatment sometimes reach a body mass index threshold that, on paper, makes them seem healthy, triggering the end of insurance coverage for treatment.  
Louisville Republican Rep. Ken Fleming wants to change that and is filing legislation in 2026 that would remove body mass index (more commonly known as BMI) from treatment standards for state qualified health insurance plans marketed through kynect. 
A Louisville eating disorder expert said such a change is needed. 
“I’ve had this happen to me too many times to count at this point now: You will have somebody who is in treatment and who needs more treatment, but they gain a little bit of weight because they’re eating regularly, because they’re in treatment, and then the insurance company says, ‘okay, well, they don’t need treatment anymore, we’re going to discharge them right then,’” explained Cheri Levinson, an associate professor with the University of Louisville and the director of Louisville’s Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab. 
“On the opposite end of that, you might have somebody who loses half a pound, and the insurance company says, ‘Oh, well, they need a higher level of care, so they can’t stay in your treatment program anymore,’” she added. “Essentially, as a clinician or as a clinic providing this type of treatment, you end up in this situation where any sort of movement on weight causes the insurance company to discharge them from the care that they need.”   
Fleming, who has experience running a mental health agency, said his legislation initially came from a constituent a few years ago who had issues with insurance while in treatment. 
“Once an individual reaches the BMI threshold, then coverage can be stopped. But they’re missing the point in terms of treating the mental health aspect of it,” Fleming said. “And so, once you reach that threshold there’s, I guess, an approach or thought that, ‘okay, you reached it. You’re fine. Let’s move on.’ In reality, that’s not the case. You may have gotten your body into a better spot, but you still have some elements or some issues or some challenges or some triggers or whatever it might be that could (cause) them to relapse.” 
Using BMI in general is “extremely problematic,” said Levinson: “We know that BMI is supposed to be a population based measure, not an individual indicator of health.” 
Cheri Levinson is an associate professor with the university and the director of Louisville’s Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab. (Photo provided)
“Weight gain is only one of the characteristics that’s needed for somebody to recover from an eating disorder, and usually you’ll have people who are nutritionally restored, … their BMI might look healthy, but they’re actually still extremely cognitively sick,” she said. “Their brain has not healed yet.”  
Fleming’s bill will apply only to state qualified health plans for individuals and small groups marketed on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchange, he said. That will still cover a substantial number of patients, Levinson said. At least a quarter of her patients getting inpatient and outpatient treatment for eating disorders belong to such plans.  
Almost 100,000 Kentuckians purchase health insurance on the ACA marketplace but that number is expected to drop next year because of premium increases and the end of enhanced federal subsidies. Congress is considering ways to hold down costs.
‘We’re creating another crisis’
During the federal government shutdown, around 600,000 Kentuckians’ food assistance was frozen after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in late October that it wouldn’t use contingency funds to keep SNAP benefits flowing. 
Such scarcity is directly related to eating disorders, Levinson said, making such a policy change as Fleming is suggesting timely. 
“The primary trigger for eating disorders is problematic restrictions,” she said. “People who are food insecure obviously have periods of time when they don’t have enough to eat, and not even necessarily by choice. They’re restricting, but that restriction can then trigger things like binge eating, can trigger purging, which can trigger all sorts of other problematic behaviors.” 
It’s too early to know the full impact of the SNAP benefits freeze on eating disorders in Kentucky, Levinson said. 
But: “I think that we can infer that as we see more people who are food insecure in this country, we’re going to see more people with eating disorders. We’re creating another crisis,” she said. “You’re going to have more people who are on Medicaid that have eating disorders, and (there are) limited resources for people to get treatment that have that type of health care.” 
Meanwhile, Fleming believes there is appetite to pass his bill in 2026. 
“I’ve gotten a lot of good feedback from my colleagues,” he said. “Everybody’s pretty much in agreement to …. get this through. So we seem, I think, pretty optimistic and positive about it.”

(Photo by Arshia Khan for Arkansas Advocate)The city of Tulsa is challenging an Arkansas agency’s modification of a Northwest Arkansas treatment plant’s permit that discharges into the watershed that supplies the Oklahoma city’s drinking water.
The City of Decatur’s wastewater plant receives waste from Centerton and a nearby Simmons Food plant and discharges into streams that feed Lakes Eucha and Spavinaw, from which Tulsa draws its water. Decatur entered into a consent order with the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality last year over numerous violations of its federal Clean Water Act permit. Tulsa said the violations, which have continued since the order was signed, are reason enough to reject expanding the plant until Decatur complies with its original permit.
Tulsa has additional concerns: that the modified permit could result in higher levels of pollutants discharged into the watershed that supplies its drinking water.
The modified permit increases the plant capacity by just over 1.5 million gallons per day (MGD), to 5.36 MGD, reflecting the construction of additional capacity at the plant due to “rapidly increasing” waste flows. But Tulsa says modification shouldn’t be approved until plans for unaddressed “choke points” within the treatment plant are submitted and approved, or until a survey is completed to determine what waste pretreatment, if any, should be required.
“Decatur has no plans to increase pre-treatment or reduce the amount of wastewater which it takes from sources outside of Decatur,” Tulsa wrote in public comments on the permit in October. “The increase in flow via the permit modification should be denied until such time as Decatur can increase flow while also decreasing the total amount of phosphorus which Decatur discharges into the watershed.”
Decatur and Tulsa are parties to a 2003 federal court settlement that came after Tulsa sued Decatur and six poultry companies in 2001, alleging that discharges by the companies and the city’s wastewater plant contained phosphorus that polluted Lakes Eucha and Spavinaw, where Tulsa gets its drinking water.
Tulsa argued in its request for an administrative hearing with the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission that the modified permit violates the 2003 settlement and that the city is “directly and negatively impacted by the issuance of [Decatur’s modified permit].” Tulsa wrote the permit is unable “to address Decatur’s long history of numerous violations of the Settlement Agreement between Tulsa and Decatur,” nor was it able to address violations under the current permit and “ADEQ’s own water quality standards.”
Administrative permit appeals are an uncommon event in recent years — this is the first filed with the commission since 2023.
A spokesperson with the city of Tulsa on Friday was unable to provide further information without speaking with Tulsa’s water utility board and the lawyers representing them in the challenge.
Tulsa’s 2001 lawsuit was separate from ongoing efforts by successive Oklahoma attorneys general to hold Arkansan poultry companies responsible in court for phosphorus pollution in the Illinois River watershed.
When contacted Friday afternoon, the mayor of Decatur said he was unable to get an Advocate reporter in touch with someone from the wastewater department by the end of the day, and that he couldn’t comment until next week.
“In Tulsa’s view increased flow into the Waste Water Treatment Plant (“WWTP”) and discharge from the Decatur WWTP will only result in greater pollution to the watershed Tulsa utilizes for clean water and result in damage to the people of Oklahoma and Northwest Arkansas,” the city wrote in its Nov. 26 hearing request.
The city wrote that DEQ did not explain how any additional phosphorus that enters the watershed as a result of the higher flow would not harm water quality in the agency’s response to Tulsa’s comments on the permit modification. It asks the pollution control commission to vacate the permit changes and find that DEQ acted “arbitrarily and capriciously and contrary to law” when it granted the change.
A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Environment, DEQ’s parent agency, did not respond to a request for comment on the permit appeal.
Decatur has a documented history of permit violations, with two consent orders with DEQ in the last ten years. Tulsa alleges in its appeal request that “Decatur is not actively working to address any of its exceedances or deficiencies.” DEQ’s 2024 consent order “came only after years of ignoring exceedances and Decatur as yet to reach compliance. Furthermore, it confounds logic to increase the flow into the plant without the existing plant coming into full compliance,” Tulsa wrote to DEQ.
According to data from the EPA, the amount of phosphorus discharged by the plant nearly tripled between 2010 and 2024. The majority of those increases have occurred since 2020. Incomplete 2025 data shows lower amounts of phosphorus compared to 2024. That data does not yet include November or December discharge data.
But Tulsa says there are still problems. Data collected by the city from Columbia Hollow Creek, where the Decatur plant discharges treated wastewater, showed “a substantial increase in the concentration of total phosphorus and the abundance of E. coli in samples” between April 2025 and September 2025 that indicate an existing, unaddressed issue at the Decatur plant. That data was not provided in the request.
In its October comments on the DEQ modification consent order, Tulsa threatened another lawsuit if Decatur’s permit modification was not overturned.
“Granting the permit as written will absolutely result in more phosphorus in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed, a greatly enhanced risk of harm to the City Water Supply and will also result in litigation with Decatur and ADEQ,” the city wrote, asserting later that the communications from the Arkansas Department of Health amounted to concerns that “show the project is marginal on a good day, and at worst presents a potential for environmental disaster for the people of Northwest Arkansas and Northeast Oklahoma.”
Phosphorus flowing from Arkansas poultry growers into Oklahoma’s waters has remained a cause of contention throughout the 21st century — Attorney General Tim Griffin published an op-ed Friday blasting the long-running Illinois River watershed lawsuit in Talk Business and Politics.
“Arkansas will continue to oppose Oklahoma’s attempt to threaten our farmers, weaken our economy, and limit our sovereignty,” Griffin wrote in the op-ed, which was published days after Tyson said it may not enter into contracts with poultry growers in the watershed going forward unless Oklahoma backs off its demands in the long-running lawsuit.
A federal judge ruled in favor of Oklahoma in 2023, but still has not issued a final decision in the case — though he ruled earlier this year that the watershed still remained polluted, fifteen years after it went to trial. Oklahoma’s attorney general said at the time that the final decision could come by the end of 2025.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Misty-Decature-aa-6-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

Transgender health advocates and an attorney in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia case said the favorable decision is encouraging for the patients and the broader transgender community. But it’s only one battle won against the Trump administration’s campaign to end transgender health care.
And, they warn, the administration’s tactics could be applied to other types of politically-charged areas of health care, such as reproductive care.

“The records the Department of Justice are seeking here are the most sensitive types of medical records,” said Mimi McKenzie, legal director of the Public Interest Law Center in Philadelphia, which represented the families along with lawyers from the firm Ballard Sphar. 
“That coupled with the fact this administration has made no secret of its agenda against transgender youth means that this is a really important win for the families,” McKenzie said.
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) sued to quash a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice in June, that purported to seek the information for an investigation of off-label uses of medications such as puberty blockers that are commonly used in medical care for transgender people. 
It was one of more than 20 similar demands made to hospitals across the country, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital (UPMC).
“Medical professionals and organizations that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology will be held accountable by this Department of Justice,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement announcing the subpoenas.
But the administration is in a position to keep pushing the issue until it gets a favorable ruling, said Michael Ulrich, associate professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health and School of Law.
“All you need is one district court that says it’s fine, or one circuit court, and you can appeal it all the way up to the Supreme Court,” Ulrich said. “If anything, this administration has shown it believes the higher it goes, the more likely it is to win.”
The DOJ declined a request for comment. CHOP also did not respond to the Capital-Star’s request for comment.
The department has filed an appeal of a September ruling by U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun in Boston, which was the first to block a DOJ subpoena for patient information and medical records from Boston Children’s Hospital’s gender affirming care program. 
It is also appealing a Seattle federal judge’s decision to quash a subpoena issued to QueerDoc, a Washington-based medical clinic that provides gender-affirming health care to adult and adolescent patients.










What this does is entrench from the highest levels that you are different, you are strange, you are not good enough as you are.


– Michael Ulrich, associate professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health and School of Law


U.S. District Judge Mark A. Kearney, who handled the CHOP ruling, referred in his opinion to a fourth subpoena case filed “completely under seal” in which a federal judge ruled against the DOJ.
That means the indirect effects of the administration’s demands on transgender health care could quietly continue to erode access and cause transgender people to hesitate in seeking appropriate care.
“There’s certainly a strategy behind this in terms of providers constantly having to deal with and worry about it, and they eventually say … it’s not worth dealing with anything close to this because of the target it puts on us,” Ulrich said.
It could have dire consequences for the transgender population, Ulrich said, which experiences mental health issues such as suicidal ideal, self harm and substance abuse at significantly higher rates than cisgender people, according to the Williams Institute at the University of California – Los Angeles.
“What this does is entrench from the highest levels that you are different, you are strange, you are not good enough as you are,” Ulrich said, which has the potential to exacerbate mental health problems already fueled by the sense of being ostracized many transgender people experience.
While CHOP did not oppose the DOJ’s request for many of the 15 categories of records the DOJ sought, it told the department it would not compromise the privacy of its patients by providing their confidential health information.
Joined by parents of transgender children treated at the hospital, CHOP argued the DOJ lacked authority to compel the release of the contested records and that the children’s privacy interests outweighed the government’s need for the records. 
Kearney agreed, ruling in favor of the hospital and patients.
In the Nov. 21 decision, Kearney found the DOJ did not show the individual records of gender affirming care patients were relevant to its investigation and therefore lacked authority to demand them. 
Even if the information was relevant to the investigation the DOJ described, “the children’s and their families’ privacy interests in their highly sensitive and confidential medical and psychological treatment in a charged political environment, which considers their medical treatment to [be] a radicalized warped ideology, far outweigh the Department of Justice’s shifting need for the information,” Kearney wrote. 
Fights against the DOJ subpoenas are going on across the country 
In federal court in Pittsburgh, the Public Interest Law Center and Ballard Spahr are also representing four families trying to bar the DOJ’s access to their children’s records held by UPMC. The hospital itself has not challenged the subpoena, but disclosed in a filing last week that it has not disclosed to the government any of the challenged records. 
The families of 10 transgender children in Maryland last month challenged a subpoena issued for Children’s National Hospital. And in California, six families filed a proposed class action lawsuit to quash a demand for minor patients’ records from the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
Corinne Goodwin, of the Eastern PA Trans Equity Project, noted the DOJ focus on transgender health care for minors has already reduced access. Penn State Hershey Medical Center and Jefferson Health are among Pennsylvania hospitals that have suspended care for transgender youth.

The Trump administration’s proposed rule that would block Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for any services provided at hospitals that also provide pediatric gender affirming care would have an even greater chilling effect, Goodwin said. 
Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLAD Law, which provides legal advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community, said the Trump administration’s attack on the transgender community reaches far beyond health care. She cited the elimination of the non-gender sex marker “X” in U.S. passports, as one example of the broader onslaught against trans-rights. 
As a result, families who are caught in the middle of the medical records fight are also unable to obtain or update passports to travel to continue their care abroad.
Levi said the mounting attacks and growing uncertainty make this “a really scary time and vulnerable time for parents with adolescent transgender children.”
“This is a moment when these kinds of attacks by the administration cause so many problems for families, for young adults,” she said. “And that’s why it’s so important for the courts to step up in their traditional roles to protect this community.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1323919275-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

Did the 40 minute public shaming of the city fire chief solve the problem? No. 
Did social media outrage from this incident solve the problem? No. 
But problem-solving is no longer the point. The point is the overwrought performance which supplies the viral video clip. The point is the rage bait.
Rage bait — manipulative tactics used to drive engagement online — is the Oxford University Press word of the year for 2025. If you spend any time at all online, particularly on social media, you do not need an Oxford dictionary to confirm how constant and pernicious the rage and rage baiting are.
We are entering primary election season here in Kentucky, and we have already been talking with our friends and neighbors about the hateful, hard to stomach ads to replace Mitch McConnell in the U.S. Senate. 
In one of his ads, Senate candidate Rep. Andy Barr says, “The woke left wants to neuter America, literally.” What in the world does that mean? He then shows a clip of black people standing in a circle, burning a flag, and then photos of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Chuck Schumer, fists raised, looking angry, with Barr’s voiceover, “They hate our values, they hate our history, and goodness knows they hate President Trump.” 
So much hate, and that’s just the first 20 seconds. 
A political action committee (PAC) backing Barr has released an ad which calls Nate Morris, one of Barr’s opponents in the Senate race, “Fake Nate Morris: fully woke and full of sh—.”
Do these ads inform the public about policies that will create jobs, lower grocery prices, build affordable housing or ensure that American families are not bankrupted by medical debt? 
No, because talking about these issues does not spark enough interest or outrage for politicians to get our attention in a fractured media landscape of 30-second soundbites. 
On her Dec. 4 podcast, Jessica Tarlov, one of the cohosts of Fox News’ The Five, discusses (at the 48 minute mark) how politicians cannot break through in today’s media landscape without fomenting rage online which, in turn, goes viral and keeps their names in our distracted, short-attention-span minds until election day. 
Rage baiting, Tarlov says, is “an apt word of the year.” 
Social media algorithms are the third rail running through and ruining our political discourse and relationships, and yet we have grown so accustomed to online rage that we are often numb to it. “Folks with the big platforms are the ones that are driving American society,” Tarlov says, “They’re getting hired into the biggest jobs you can have, from the secretary of war to the heads of these media companies. Everyone needs content creators and influencers, whatever you want to call them, on the landing page of their organization … and it’s a vicious cycle that keeps feeding it.”
The morning after the Nov. 3 Lawrenceburg City Council meeting, I watched the video go viral and the outraged commentary that accompanied it. At first, when I spotted a Facebook post that I knew was not wholly accurate, I commented with missing context, writing that I’d been there and witnessed the entire meeting. 
Nobody cared. Within minutes I deleted my comments, as adding facts only sparked more rage.
Rage baiting is Oxford dictionary’s word of the year for a reason.

(Photo courtesy of Knox County Schools/YouTube)When the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked this year in a case over whether charter schools can be religious, experts said it wouldn’t take long for the question to re-emerge in another lawsuit.
They were right.
In Tennessee, the nonprofit Wilberforce Academy is suing the Knox County Schools in federal court because the district refuses to allow a Christian charter school. Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti is on the school’s side. He issued an opinion last month that the state’s ban on religious charter schools likely violates the First Amendment.
“Tennessee’s public charter schools are not government entities for constitutional purposes and may assert free exercise rights,” he wrote to Rep. Michele Carringer, the Knoxville Republican who requested the opinion.
The legal challenge in Tennessee comes as a Florida-based charter school network prepares to submit an application to the Oklahoma Charter School Board for a Jewish virtual charter high school. Peter Deutsch, the former Democratic congressman who founded the Ben Gamla charter schools, began working on the idea long before the case over St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School even went to court. The U.S. Supreme Court decision means that an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision blocking the school from receiving state funds still stands.

“The prior decision shows that there’s an open question here that needs to be resolved,” said Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a law firm representing the National Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School Foundation. “We hope the court will get it right this time. We hope the federal courts get it right without having to go to the Supreme Court.”
Idaho also confronted the issue earlier this year. The state’s first charter, Brabeion Academy, initially promoted the school as Christian. But it was approved in August as a nonreligious school and will open as such next fall.

‘A Day to Exhale’: Supreme Court Deadlocks on Religious Charter Schools — For Now

 




Deutsch, Skrmetti and other supporters of faith-based charter schools base their argument on three earlier Supreme Court rulings allowing public funds to support sectarian schools. They say that excluding religious organizations from operating faith-based charter schools is discrimination and violates the Constitution. But leaders of the charter sector and public school advocates argue that classifying charter schools as private would threaten funding and civil rights protections for 3.7 million students nationwide.
“Unless and until the U.S. Supreme Court takes up a future case and rules otherwise, we advise all charter school associations and public charter schools to adhere to the letter and spirit of the law in their respective states,” Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, said in a statement.
‘Not on our watch’

When the Supreme Court considered St. Isidore, Deutsch, was prepared to advocate for Jewish congregations to open schools that not only teach their language, but also their faith. He called the case “a historic opportunity” to bring Jewish education to thousands of children.
To Oklahoma Attorney General Genter Drummond, the debate is settled, for now. In November, he said his office would “oppose any attempts to undermine the rule of law.”
Americans United, which advocates for maintaining church-state separation, has also issued a warning over the new school. The organization represented parents and advocates in a separate case over the school.
“Religious extremists once again are trying to undermine our country’s promise of church-state separation by forcing Oklahoma taxpayers to fund a religious public school. Not on our watch,” Rachel Laser, president and CEO, said in a press release.

The legal fight over religious charter schools began in 2023, when the Oklahoma Virtual Charter School Board voted 3-2 to approve a charter for St. Isidore, setting off a closely watched case that spanned two years. At the time, the Jewish Federation of Greater Oklahoma City, a nonreligious group, called the charter board’s decision unconstitutional. Rachel Johnson, the group’s executive director, didn’t return calls or emails requesting a comment on Ben Gamla’s proposal.
None of the members who originally voted on St. Isidore serves on the state’s new Oklahoma Charter School Board. But for one person involved with Ben Gamla’s application, this is familiar territory. Brett Farley is on the proposed school’s board, according to a letter of intent the foundation submitted to the charter board in November.
Farley once held a top position with the Oklahoma GOP and is also executive director of the Catholic Conference of Oklahoma, which focuses on public policy issues involving the church. While preparing the St. Isidore application, Farley connected with Notre Dame law Professor Nicole Stelle Garnett, whose scholarly work formed the basis of the legal argument for the school.
Garnett’s position is that nonprofits running charter schools are like private contractors, and as with other publicly funded programs, can’t be excluded just because they are religious. She’s also close friends with Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who recused herself from the St. Isidore case. Experts speculated that Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the three liberals on the court, resulting in the 4-4 tie.

‘Passion for religious freedom’
The virtual school, the intent letter says, would initially enroll about 40 students, focusing on “college readiness, while developing deep Jewish knowledge, faith and values within a supportive learning community.”
But some are surprised Deutsch isn’t making his bid for a Jewish charter school in Florida, where his existing, non-religious charter schools have thrived.
“I think Florida could be a good option given the new attorney general’s passion for religious freedom,” said Daniel Aqua, the director of special projects at Teach Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for Jewish education.

After Contentious Vote, Hebrew Charter Founder Eyes Jewish School in Oklahoma

 




The demand for a Jewish charter school would be much higher in Florida, which has an estimated Jewish population of nearly 762,000, compared with about 9,000 in Oklahoma.
Charter founders in Florida submit their applications to local school districts first. The state recently added colleges as authorizers, but Oklahoma, where organizers can file applications directly with the state charter board, offers a more streamlined process.
‘Public Christian school’
But efforts to create publicly-funded religious schools are not limited to the charter sector. A new school in Colorado, Riverstone Academy, calls itself the state’s “first public Christian school.” Now serving 30 students in Pueblo, south of Colorado Springs, Riverstone is what is sometimes referred to as a “contract” school because districts sign agreements with private organizations to provide education services. In this case, Education reEnvisioned, one of the state’s 21 boards of cooperative educational services, or BOCES, authorized the school.
In October, the Colorado Department of Education warned Ken Witt, the BOCES’ executive director, that the school’s per-student funding is at risk because it is “not operating in a nonsectarian nature.” The letter also went to District 49, near Colorado Springs, one of Education reEnvisioned’s member districts.
In a response, Witt wrote that he was “alarmed at the threat” that the school might not receive funding. “We did not and legally cannot discriminate against this school on account of its religious affiliation,” he wrote. Examining Riverstone’s curriculum to determine if the school is truly sectarian, he said, would be “unconstitutionally entangling and discriminatory against different forms of religion.”
Witt told The 74 that funding usually doesn’t flow from the state to a new school until January, so it’s too soon to know whether officials will withhold funds.

‘Keep coming back’
“You’re going to see those within the charter sector and outside of it basically taking the same approach” — arguing that private groups delivering religious instruction can’t be denied public funds, said Preston Green, an education professor at the University of Connecticut.
To Green, Riverstone’s identity as a “contract” school calls to mind a 1982 case, one that Garnett and other proponents of religious charter schools often highlight when they say that charters are not “state actors.” In Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, the Supreme Court said a Massachusetts private school that received public funds for educating teens with behavior problems did not act under the “color of state law” when it fired six employees.
The question, experts say, is not if, but when the Supreme Court will eventually see another case about religious public schools Justice Barrett won’t have the same reason to recuse herself, Green said, and he’s not convinced that Roberts would side with the liberals a second time.
The advocates, he said, “keep coming back at this because they think that they’ll get the votes.”

(Photo Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As George Mason University Rector Charles Stimson addressed his colleagues Thursday, he sat across from faculty members, students and campus workers holding signs plastered with images of his face, gathered in opposition to his decision to hold a second executive committee meeting with only six voting members.
Tensions have boiled over within the Northern Virginia university’s community over Stimson’s decision to meet and vote on university matters without the required quorum. Outside of GMU’s meeting on Thursday, protestors yelled “no quorum, no business,” and organizers accused the board of meeting improperly.
One of the organizing groups, the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said in a statement that Stimson is flouting rules to push his “ideological agenda,” and claimed the board is considering a settlement by the Department of Justice to drop the four investigations against the institution similar to the University of Virginia.
UVA interim president to senators: Agreement with DOJ to pause probes was ‘best option available’

University officials told the Mercury that it has no proposed settlement agreement.
Stimson, who stated that the board is simply “following the law,” mentioned in an interview after the meeting that in the absence of a quorum, legislative actions by state lawmakers have supported the executive committee’s role in meeting and addressing the institution’s business.
“Our bylaws incorporated (those legislative actions) decades ago … because you can’t run a university from a board perspective if you don’t have an executive committee or some component of the board, and so we’re just doing what the law authorized,” said Stimson.
Stimson pointed to several policies to support the executive committee’s meetings, including Virginia Code 23.1-1502, the university’s bylaws, and the 1919 statute enacted by the General Assembly that codified the executive committee’s authority, which he says has been rooted in the traditions of university governance.
The rector said the practice of allowing the university’s executive committee to conduct regular business in the absence of a quorum has been in place since the early 1800s. The only body that can repeal rules, Stimson said, is the General Assembly.
“No high-functioning organization defenestrates an executive committee from doing the regular business of a university, which is what we were doing,” Stimson said.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said he spoke with Stimson in October before the first executive committee, telling the Mercury that Senate Democrats disagree with the rector’s view and question if the decision runs afoul with the preliminary junction set in July to suspend governor appointments from serving on the governing board.
On Thursday, GMU’s executive committee approved several actions including the university’s six-year operating plan, which needed to be voted on by December to follow state statute. The committee opted to establish two new degree programs, an MS in quantum science and engineering and a PhD in cybersecurity, and to rename the College of Public Health’s Department of Health Administration to the Department of Health Administration, Policy, and Informatics. 
Members also voted on the conferral of emeritus/emerita status, and the election of new tenured faculty. Meanwhile, the board is waiting for all 10 vacant seats to be filled through a court order or legislative action.
“We have to promote faculty members, we have to give people tenure,” Stimson said. “When we hire people, we hire them in their contract with the express understanding that they’ll get tenure, and the only people that can give them tenure is the board. … None of us on this board are going to refuse to conduct our fiduciary duties and honor our obligations to the university.”
 The future

In Charlottesville, critics said the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors has also recently convened short of the necessary number of representatives who are Virginia residents and alumni. Last Friday, campus workers and faculty members rallied in protest of the action as well as the institution continuing its search for the next president without a full board in place.
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger recently told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that on her first day, she would fill the vacancies on three university governing boards at George Mason, UVA and the Virginia Military Institute. 
Simultaneously, eight gubernatorial appointments await a court’s decision on their future. The Senate Committee on Elections and Privileges rejected 22 appointees of Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year. 
Since the Virginia Supreme Court refused to take up the case involving Youngkin’s appointees, a status hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 8 at 9 a.m. in the Fairfax County Circuit Court.

The nonalcoholic beverage option has been growing nationwide as an alternative for people who are looking to cut back or cut out alcohol altogether. A recent Gallup poll showed the percentage of Americans drinking alcohol has fallen to 54%.  
Analysts and farmers say the hemp-based THC industry, however, could come to an abrupt halt by November of next year as Congress voted to ban most hemp-derived THC products in a last-minute addition to a government spending bill that ended the most recent government shutdown.
Joint Commission unveils changes to cannabis bill, setting stage for 2026 retail launch

The THC seltzers and other hemp-based products are a “big and growing segment of the economy,” Bingo Beer co-owner Jay Bayer told the Mercury earlier this year. 
“I don’t think the solution is to put the genie back in the bottle,” Bayer said in a recent call.  He added that offering THC products has been a “lifeline” for some in the alcoholic beverage industry to stay afloat while meeting consumers’ needs. 
But as Virginia continues to explore a legal cannabis market, Bayer is eyeing possible ways to  pivot. 
“If we were to switch over to THC from marijuana, consumers would come over with us,” he said. 
 Uncertain future

Hemp businesses nationwide are trying to map their next steps. In North Carolina, for example, hemp businesses are bracing for potential legal battles to defend their industry, like other states where cannabis isn’t legal.
“We can’t really pivot,” Dana Burham, co-owner of Otherside Hemp, told NC Newsline last month. 
But Virginia is in a “privileged” space, Pure Shenandoah co-owner Tanner Johnson said in a recent call. He runs the company with several of his siblings as their products run the gamut of industrial hemp uses, from a “hempcrete” study contract with the U.S. Air Force they were awarded in 2023, to being the supplier for Bingo Beer’s THC seltzers. 
While Congress laid the groundwork for businesses in the industry in 2018, Johnson likened the hemp-limited provision in the government spending bill as “pulling the rug” from under people. But companies like his own with diversified portfolios and Virginia businesses could have an easier time pivoting than those in states with no existing or forthcoming legal cannabis market. Still, he said, he’s keeping an eye on things nationally. 
As a representative of  the Virginia Cannabis Association, he will also lend insights and ideas to lawmakers as they craft and pass the legislation to enable the new market. 
“It’s a bad situation for a lot of hemp growers and processors and retailers,” Johnson said. “But in Virginia, we kind of feel like we’re almost threading a needle, where this industry is coming to a close right as another industry opens.”

Yates for the Virginia Mercury)In Southwest Virginia, two proposed pipeline projects would lengthen two existing pipelines and add additional compressor stations to help pump more gas through the commonwealth into North Carolina. Residents’ concerns over past violations and an expedited permitting process prompted Virginia Democratic U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan and Bobby Scott to demand federal regulators perform a more thorough review last week.
In a letter penned by the two members and North Carolina U.S. Rep. Valerie Foushee, the lawmakers urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to scrutinize the potential environmental impacts of the two projects.
“On behalf of communities in Virginia and North Carolina, we urge the Commission to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for both projects before considering them further. If FERC is unwilling to do so, we urge the Commission to deny the certification of both projects to ensure that the surrounding communities are not placed at undue risk,” the letter read.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate project would add 31 miles of pipeline from Pittsylvania County across the border to North Carolina. Concurrently, the Williams Company wants to expand the Transco pipeline by an additional 55 miles – 26 of which would be run adjacent to the pipeline in Southwest Virginia and create additional compressor stations in Pittsylvania County.
FERC did not require a new Environmental Impact Statement to be done for the new projects, which is a deeper examination of how the project may impact wetlands, pollute waterways and other possible environmental concerns. 
For the two separate expansion projects, FERC accepted the previous reports and said no risks to human health or the environment were expected with the expansions. The members of Congress took issue with that assessment and said the agency was straying from precedence of review for projects of this size.
“This massive project will have significant environmental impacts that demand a thorough review and a complete EIS,” the letter read. “Further, not conducting an EIS for SSEP would be a dramatic departure from past FERC policy and practice for projects of this magnitude. The Commission has consistently completed EISs for projects much smaller in size than SSEP.”
The members pointed to 375 alleged violations former Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring’s office in 2018 said MVP committed, including unpermitted discharges into waterways, failure to maintain erosion, and other water related issues. The company ultimately settled the issue by paying a $2.5 million civil fine. 
The letter also details local pushback to the two projects because they are so close to each other and raises residents’ concerns about the potential impact of two major pipelines nearby.
“The colocation of two high-pressure, large diameter pipelines is of significant concern for local residents. Multiple local governments and other elected officials have expressed concerns about the safety and health impacts of these proposed pipelines,” the letter said.
Twelve Democratic members of the General Assembly sent a letter to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and FERC asking the agencies to deny permits for the two expansion projects until cumulative impact research can be done for the area.
“We are specifically concerned about the co-location of two high-pressure pipelines on nearly identical routes through Pittsylvania County and the undue burden that would place on waterbodies crossed repeatedly by both projects, including the Banister River, Sandy River and tributaries of the Dan River,” the legislator’s letter said.
The federal permits for the two projects are expected to be issued or denied in the next few months. DEQ is also in the process of reviewing the state permits for both pipelines.

For […[...]","Red Onion State Prison in Wise County (Photo courtesy of Virginia Department of Corrections.) Over the past two years, the Virginia General Assembly approved legislation to limit the use of solitary confinement across prisons in the commonwealth. 
Legislation to this effect was passed in 2023, which was signed into law by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Critics, however, argue that this new law lacks adequate enforcement mechanisms and protective limits. For this reason, the General Assembly passed follow-up legislation in 2024 with stronger language, which was subsequently vetoed.
The fact that the General Assembly passed legislation two years in a row to end the widespread use of solitary confinement indicates broad public support for the goal. The legislation, however, does not address the isolation of inmates in regional and city jails. As a research team of two students and a professor, we set out to determine how many people in local jails across Virginia are being held in conditions similar to solitary confinement.
Most sheriffs and jail superintendents will insist they do not use solitary confinement. We learned instead to substitute the phrase “administrative segregation,” which in most cases means the same thing: an inmate held for 20-24 hours a day in a cell about the size of a parking space, typically behind a heavy steel door with a tiny window and narrow slot that just fits a food tray. On a positive note, one jail administrator informed us that most of the administrative segregation at his facility instead has barred doors that easily allow for communication across cells, but we suspect this is the exception, rather than the rule.
Because data about the number of people held in administrative segregation is not publicly available, we sent information requests to 35 regional and city jails across Virginia asking for a “snapshot,” which would help us do a point-in-time count of the number of people held in solitary-like conditions at a local level. 
We only heard back from 11 jails, which makes our goal of producing a total population estimate unreachable. But we still learned something important: the use of isolated confinement is highly variable between jails. 
One city jail reported to us that it holds 69 out of a total 238 inmates (almost one in three persons detained in the facility) in administrative segregation behind heavy steel doors. Two jails housed more than one out of ten inmates in isolation. Others held between 4-7% of their population in solitary-like conditions. 
Importantly, three jails kept less than 3% of their inmates in administrative segregation. One regional jail in Central Virginia reported that only 1% of total inmates are held in isolation.
This variability indicates that some regional jails may be over-relying on solitary confinement to run their institutions. But, in order to encourage jails to share this information with us, we told them we would not name specific institutions in our reporting.
There is a robust literature in the social sciences on the harms associated with solitary confinement for periods longer than 14 days. We humans are innately social, maintaining our sense of self and frameworks for cognition in dialogue with others. 
Research shows that prolonged isolation can cause mental anguish and long-term psychological harm. Even short-term exposure to isolated confinement can result in a higher likelihood to reoffend and decreased rates of employment after release.
Several sheriffs and jail superintendents told us that administrative segregation is a necessary safety and disciplinary tool. Without it, they said, our local and regional jails would be more dangerous places for both inmates and jail staff. 
We are not experts in incarceration, and we do not dispute this point. But we also believe that, without protective laws and public oversight, there is the potential that administrative segregation could be used more than necessary, and that it would be a good goal for our society to use it as infrequently as possible.
Afterall, our preliminary research indicates at least a few jails in Virginia operate with minimal use of administrative segregation. This, to us, is very hopeful. Perhaps these jails could be models for other institutions across the state working to reduce the number of inmates held in isolation. 
At a minimum, we think all jails in Virginia should regularly report to the public on the number of persons held in administrative segregation. These institutions are funded by taxpayers, and taxpayers have a right to know about the conditions in which they operate, especially as they rely — even if out of necessity —  on methods of incarceration known to cause suffering and psychological harm.
We also hope the General Assembly will one day address the use of isolated confinement in city and regional jails. Currently, state code provides very minimal protections for inmates held in these local facilities.
For instance, inmates only have a right to a minimum of one hour out of their cell for recreation a week and for two weekly showers. These are only minimum standards. Local jails likely do much better, governed by their own rules and procedures. But operating standards for city and regional jails are typically not made public so we don’t know what, for instance, local policies are on the use of administrative segregation.
Sunlight, Supreme Court Justice William Brandies said, is the best disinfectant. With more sun shining into local and regional jails, we might bring more inmates out of the shadows of isolated confinement.

A more cost-effective approach to addressing the primary care workforce shortage in the state would be providing more scholarships and support for students attending existing nurse practitioner programs. (Getty photo)Rhode Island’s primary care system is stressed, and the state struggles to recruit and retain new primary care physicians. To address the ongoing primary care shortage, a special legislative commission is exploring the feasibility of creating a new public medical school at the University of Rhode Island. Its report recommended that URI should develop a ‘community-based’ medical school with an emphasis on training primary care physicians. The new medical school would cost taxpayers $22.5 million annually after an initial public investment of $20 million in initial start-up funds, for a total of $245 million over the next decade. A new public medical school, however, is the wrong prescription to address the state’s ongoing shortage of primary care clinicians. Instead, policymakers need to enact broader and more comprehensive reforms to attract and retain clinicians in Rhode Island.
The closure of Anchor Medical highlights the need for fundamental reforms to improve the state’s ability to attract physicians. As Dr. Alexandra Tien has noted, the closure is the result of unsuccessful recruitment of new physicians to replace those who are retiring. This begs the question: Why is it so difficult to recruit and retain primary care physicians in Rhode Island? Wallet Hub ranked Rhode Island as the second-worst state in the nation for doctors to practice, citing low average annual wages (48th in the nation) and high malpractice award payments per capita (tied for first).
Physicians in Rhode Island earn less than their peers in Connecticut and Massachusetts. The General Assembly recently boosted primary care reimbursement for Medicaid by $40 million (including $15 million in state funding) but the NBC 10 I-Team found that commercial insurance reimbursement rates are 29% higher in nearby Massachusetts communities. The governor and General Assembly also asked the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner to undertake a review of primary care reimbursement in 2026. Both are important steps toward improving the practice environment in Rhode Island.
The number of primary care residency openings in Rhode Island also shapes whether physicians will stay to practice in Rhode Island after completing their medical training. Upon graduating from medical school, newly minted MDs must complete a residency (and often a fellowship) before entering practice. Rather than increasing the number of medical school graduates, the U.S. needs to address a longstanding bottleneck in the number of residency positions. Between 2011 and 2017, fewer than half of the primary care doctors who completed their family medicine residency programs in Rhode Island remained in the state to practice, which underscores the difficulty of retaining physicians in the state.
The timing of the proposed medical school also occurs in a challenging fiscal environment. As the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council noted, the Ocean State faces a growing structural budget deficit over the coming decade. Deficits are expected to increase from $304.3 million in fiscal year  2027 to more than $462.1 million by fiscal year 2030. In this context, opening a new publicly funded medical school at a cost of nearly $250 million will exacerbate an already difficult budgetary forecast.










Between 2011 and 2017, fewer than half of the primary care doctors who completed their family medicine residency programs in Rhode Island remained in the state to practice, which underscores the difficulty of retaining physicians in the state.


A recent report by the Milbank Memorial Fund and the Physicians’ Foundation noted that over time, fewer physicians are choosing careers in primary care. At the same time, roughly one in four Medicare patient visits were delivered by nurse practitioners or physician assistants. It’s time for policymakers to rethink the debate about primary care in Rhode Island. Instead of a narrow focus on the shortage of primary care physicians, we must seek to recruit, train, and retain enough primary care clinicians to live and work in Rhode Island.
Rather than investing $22.5 million per year in a new medical school, the state could provide additional scholarships and support for students attending existing nurse practitioner programs at Rhode Island College, Salve Regina University, and URI. Indeed, investing in nurse practitioners (NPs) offers a cost-effective approach to addressing the primary care shortfall in Rhode Island. 
It would take nine years before a new public medical school at the University of Rhode Island graduates its first cohort of students. Rhode Island simply can’t wait that long. Instead, the state should build upon recent initiatives to improve reimbursement for primary care clinicians and strengthen existing programs to train more nurse practitioners.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)As New Hampshire’s education freedom account program swells past 10,000 student participants, legislative oversight has faltered.
A committee meant to monitor the EFA program’s performance has not met publicly in more than a year, records show, and it has failed to produce its required annual report by its Nov. 30 deadline.
The Education Freedom Savings Account Oversight Committee once met multiple times per year. But according to its public page, the last time it convened was Nov. 25, 2024, shortly before finalizing its 2024 report. 
In a statement Thursday, Sen. Ruth Ward, a Stoddard Republican and the chairwoman of the committee, said the five-person committee had attempted to meet this year but failed to find a time for all members to convene — particularly those from the House. 
“Since the end of the legislative session, we have made several attempts to schedule a meeting,” Ward said. “However, the House asked representatives to avoid travel during July and August, limiting available dates and now with the resignation of Representative (Glenn) Cordelli, we are waiting for a House replacement. 
“These factors have kept us from achieving a quorum and convening the committee,” she added, referring to the statutory requirement that the committee have three out of five members present in order to meet.
After receiving questions Thursday, Ward sent an email Friday calling on the committee to hold an organizational meeting Dec. 15, according to Rep. Peggy Balboni, a Rye Democrat and member of the committee.
But Democrats have criticized the lack of meetings and argue it highlights the need for more transparency. 
The education freedom account program allows families to access state education funds to use toward private and home-school expenses; families this year will receive an average of $4,911 per year.
In June, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed legislation that removed the income limits for the program — previously set at 350% of the federal poverty level, or $112,525 for a family of four — but set a 10,000-student cap for its first year. Due to a series of exemptions to the cap, the program began the 2025-26 school year with 10,510 students, according to the Department of Education, nearly doubling last year’s 5,765.
Republicans, who created the program in 2021 as a mechanism to support school choice, say the increase demonstrates demand. They have argued the nonprofit organization that runs the program, the Children’s Scholarship Fund, already receives sufficient oversight from the Department of Education. 
But Democrats, who oppose the program and say the funding should go to public schools, counter the jump in participation calls for more scrutiny of who is receiving EFAs and how they are spent. 
The oversight committee is supposed to help do that, Democrats say. 
Warring reports
Created by statute, the committee consists of two members of the Senate and three members of the House, and is meant to “monitor the implementation of” the program, “including the impact of state education funding to local district schools.” It is also supposed to produce an annual report by Nov. 30 that makes any legislative recommendations.
From the beginning, the process has been fractured. Democratic and Republican committee members, disagreeing over the very existence of the program, put forward widely different concepts of acceptable practices.
In 2024, for instance, the committee produced a majority report written by Republicans and a minority report by Democrats. The Republican report gave a positive portrait. “In just four years, the Education Freedom Account program has proven itself both popular and successful,” it stated, calling it “one of the fastest start-up school choice programs in the nation.”
The majority report found that the EFA program had not reduced state funding to public schools, and pointed to legislation that has increased the per-pupil amount of state funding given to public schools despite declining enrollments. “Even as the Education Freedom Account program has grown to serve more than 5,000 New Hampshire families, per-pupil state aid to local school districts has increased by nearly 20%,” the report stated, referring to the period between 2020 and 2024. 
The Republican report concluded there was no need to amend the EFA law, nor to extend the end date “phase out” grants that pay school districts gradually smaller amounts for any of their students who leave to receive an EFA.
The Democrats’ 2024 minority report produced different conclusions. It stated that much of the EFA money is going to families that had already decided not to participate in the public school system and pursue private and home-school programs. “Those families were costing the state zero dollars and now they are being given unaudited dollars,” the minority report read. The report also argued that the process by which the Children’s Scholarship Fund selects eligible vendors that may receive the EFA funds was opaque. 
The 2024 minority report said there were “substantial” funds being diverted from the state’s Education Trust Fund that could be used to boost state support for public schools, which the state Supreme Court ruled this year is unconstitutionally low. And it concluded that the EFA law should be changed by putting the Department of Education in charge of running the program instead of the private scholarship fund; capping the program to a budgeted amount; widening state audits to survey 20% of accounts; decoupling the EFA grant amounts from the state adequacy formula, which regulates how much is sent to public schools; requiring EFA recipients to end any discriminatory admissions policies, and more. 
Before issuing the separate reports, the oversight committee had met about once a month from August to November 2024. After that, the committee stopped meeting.
Scheduling problems
In her statement explaining the lack of meetings this year, Ward pointed to an announcement by House Speaker Sherman Packard in the House calendar in spring that “in keeping with past practice to minimize travel costs, there will be no legislative activity or mileage reimbursement between July and August.” 
She also noted the resignation of Cordelli, a member of the oversight committee and a key architect of the EFA program. But Cordelli resigned in early November, meaning he could have participated in September and October. 
The committee page indicates that an organizational meeting was scheduled for Oct. 21, but was canceled. 
Ward said the committee had struggled to meet quorum, which according to the statute, requires three out of five members to be present. Sen. Suzanne Prentiss, a Lebanon Democrat and member of the committee, has questioned that reasoning, arguing the committee has met before when some lawmakers couldn’t attend. 
“I don’t know what’s behind not meeting, but it’s not the membership thing,” she said. 
Meanwhile, the status of the 2025 oversight report, which was due Nov. 30, is unclear. In her statement Thursday, Ward said “work is underway on the 2025 EFA Annual Report.”
Kate Baker Demers, the executive director of the Children’s Scholarship Fund, said in an interview that she had received an email from Senate Deputy Chief of Staff Grant Bosse in November asking for statistics on the demographics of who is using EFAs in the 2025-26 school year. The Department of Education released those figures Nov. 14. 
That email indicated to Baker Demers that the committee was intending to produce the 2025 report despite the lack of meetings, she said.  
But Democrats say if work is happening, they have not been included. Prentiss said there has been no committee-wide discussion about any work on the 2025 report.
A spokeswoman for Ward did not respond to a question about whether the EFA report was being prepared without the committee meeting.
Transparency debates
Democrats’ frustration with the oversight committee comes amid a bigger battle over transparency of the program. Democrats argue there should be more public information issued around who is signing up for EFAs and how families are spending the money. 
Currently, the public can review annual reports by the Department of Education that show how many students in each town are receiving EFAs; how much those students are receiving; how many students overall have transferred into EFAs from public schools; how many EFA recipients have been approved for additional aid because they are lower-income, are English language learners, or require special education services; the racial and gender breakdown of EFA recipients; the number of EFA recipients in each grade level; and how all those metrics compare to the public school student population. 
The Children’s Scholarship Fund submits an annual 990 form to the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit organization, which details top-level receipts and expenditures. The organization also commissions an annual audit of its receipts and expenditures by Grant Thornton, a New York-based accounting firm, and publishes the results; the latest 2025 audit will be published Monday, Baker Demers said.
The EFA program receives a semi-regular audit from the state Department of Education. In 2023, the department’s EFA administrator conducted a “compliance monitoring review” of 50 randomized EFA accounts, using tax return information to determine whether they had actually been eligible for the program. That review, released in 2024, flagged problems with 12 of the 50 recipients, and resulted in the Children’s Scholarship Fund returning EFA funding for two students and addressing other recommendations.
Baker Demers said that in recent months, the department has begun a second compliance monitoring review of EFAs using the same randomized process; a spokeswoman for the department declined to confirm that.
Meanwhile, the Legislative Budget Assistant, or LBA, a nonpartisan arm of the legislative branch that conducts audits on state agencies, is reviewing the Department of Education’s oversight of the EFA law; that final audit report is expected by summer 2026, LBA staff say. 
Baker Demers says the combination of those reviews indicates that the EFA program is already subject to a lot of scrutiny.
“I don’t mind it,” she said. “It’s good – great to do audits. But it’s like a perpetual audit.” 
But Democrats say there are still many areas where they would like more information. 
They note that LBA auditors were blocked by statute from reviewing the Children’s Scholarship Fund actions directly, meaning the LBA audit will focus only on the Department of Education’s oversight of the program, and not on the approval process of EFA applicants and vendors conducted by the scholarship fund.
And they have also pointed to a decision by Baker Demers this summer to remove reports detailing how much EFA money was sent to each vendor, a move first reported by the Concord Monitor. Baker Demers told the Monitor she had done so due to the potential for harassment of smaller vendors by people opposed to the EFA program. 
On Thursday, she said the Children’s Scholarship Fund would re-upload the expenditure reports for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 school years — as well as the unreleased reports for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years — by the end of December. Those reports would redact spending data for EFA vendors serving fewer than 10 students, Baker Demers said, citing privacy and harassment concerns.
To Balboni, those measures still fall short of the accountability she feels the EFA program deserves. Next year, she is introducing two bills intended to address that. One would require the legislative oversight committee to conduct a “review of student data, eligibility requirements, and EFA expenditures.” The other would require the Department of Education to obtain full access to EFA recipient data and to conduct more extensive audits. 
“It’s just trying to get to the heart of where this money is going,” Balboni said in an interview. 
To Ward, there is already plenty of information to review. “The process continues to be transparent: reports from the Children’s Scholarship Fund, EFA meeting minutes, and annual reports are publicly accessible,” she said in her statement.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PB122675-EFA-oversight-committee-1024x694.jpg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

Clarke, an ICU nurse in Asheville, North Carolina, wants to get her master’s degree to become a nurse practitioner or a certified registered nurse anesthetist — occupations in high demand — and eventually work toward a doctoral degree.
But new borrowing limits on federal student loans may hinder her from reaching that goal.
A provision in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the tax and spending law enacted this summer, overhauls the federal student loan program for graduate students in an effort to simplify the loan process and discourage colleges from raising tuition.
To comply with the new law, the U.S. Department of Education recently issued a draft rule that would impose limits on how much graduate students can borrow — up to $20,500 per year and $100,000 in total for most students, but up to $50,000 a year and $200,000 in total for students in a new “professional” category. The category includes people studying to be medical doctors, dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists and lawyers.
Students pursuing advanced nursing degrees, however, are not included in the professional category.
Advanced practice nurses, hospital associations and other health groups say the rule will make it unaffordable for many nurses to advance their careers — disproportionately affecting communities, especially rural ones, that rely on them amid physician shortages.
Advanced nurses can provide primary care, deliver babies as nurse midwives and anesthetize surgery patients where there aren’t enough physicians to go around. They can also write some prescriptions. Advanced practice nurses also serve as college faculty in community colleges and nursing schools.
Student loan caps might worsen the national doctor shortage, critics worry

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the nation will employ an additional 134,000 nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and nurse anesthetists in the next decade, 35% more than there are now. In high demand, nurse practitioners are one of the fastest-growing occupations in the nation, the bureau says.
“We depend heavily on nurse practitioners,” said Sandy Reding, a president of the California Nurses Association and vice president of National Nurses United. “But if they don’t have access to getting further education, we’re not going to see additional nurse practitioners come into the field.”
Tuition, combined with living expenses, can far exceed $50,000 a year for many post-bachelor’s nursing programs.
“Potentially, this could devastate a whole generation of nurses getting their advanced practice degrees,” Clarke said.
Some education advocates fear that losing a pipeline of advanced nursing practitioners to serve as college faculty also could lead to fewer registered and advanced nurses and other caregivers with two- and four-year degrees, because there would be fewer people to teach them.










It’s a slap in the face to the nurses that go to work every day doing our very best to care for our patients. 


– Sandy Reding, a president of the California Nurses Association


Many advanced-degree nursing faculty are retiring. Nursing schools reported more than 2,100 full-time faculty vacancies in 2022, according to the American Nurses Association — leading to roughly 80,000 students being turned away.
States are already grappling with workforce shortfalls caused by exhausting work conditions that have led many nurses to burn out and leave the field, or leave bedside care to teach, nurses told Stateline.
In response to an uproar from nursing associations and others in health care, the Department of Education released a rebuttal last week defending its proposal, saying it is not a “value judgement about the importance of programs.”
It also said it may make changes in response to public comments. The new limits would take effect July 1, 2026.
Rural and underserved communities
Advanced practice registered nurses, known as APRNs, fill gaps in rural communities where there aren’t enough clinicians. For example, nurses needed for surgeries — nurse anesthetists, or CRNAs — make up 80% of anesthesia providers in rural counties. About a fifth of APRNs nationwide worked in rural areas in 2022, according to one survey of more than 18,800 APRNs.
“The nurse practitioners, APRNs, are a needed lifeline to help fill those gaps,” said Heidi Lucas, executive director of the Missouri Rural Health Association and former director of the state’s nurses association. “Putting barriers in the way to keep [nurses] from getting degrees — that’s just going to exacerbate the problems that we already have.”
She said Missouri will be short about 2,000 physicians next year.
The new rule cutting options for federal student loans would only worsen staffing shortages amid tenuous rural hospital budgets, said state-level observers. Hospitals already are grappling with millions of dollars in looming Medicaid cuts over the next 10 years, said Rich Rasmussen, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association.
Nurse practitioners often serve as primary care providers, writing prescriptions and managing patient care. About 80% of them see Medicaid and Medicare patients, according to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, citing federal data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
States hope to use rural health money to keep doctors, combat chronic disease

The proposal to deny advanced practice nurse practitioners the more generous loan options ignores the nation’s needs, said nurse practitioner Valerie Fuller, president of the association.
“At a time when America needs more health care providers, we can’t afford to put more obstacles in place for nurse practitioner students who want to go on and further their education and take care of the patients that need care,” said Fuller, former president of the Maine Nurse Practitioner Association. “We know it’s going to harm our workforce.”
‘Clipping the wings’
Rasmussen, of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said he is concerned about the effect the rule will have on the pipeline for certified nurse midwives and the state’s already dwindling rural maternal health care options.
“We are clipping the wings of rural [obstetrics] to be able to blossom in our state if we’re going to put these types of restrictions on the borrowing capability of nurses who want to pursue obstetrical services in nursing as well,” he said. He added that the rules will force nurses to seek private sector loans — which don’t qualify for federal loan forgiveness programs that encourage clinicians to come work in rural areas.
Teshieka Curtis-Pugh, executive director of the South Carolina Nurses Association, is also concerned about nurse midwives. South Carolina is expected to see a shortage of 3,200 physicians by 2030.
“We also live in a state that has very poor maternal outcomes, especially for women of color. So think about, how does that impact them?” she said. “That means we don’t get the certified nurse midwives who are masters prepared, some of them are doctorally prepared, who are able to fill that gap for birth in that area.”
Diversity and opportunity for students from marginalized groups could also take a hit, said Curtis-Pugh, a registered nurse with a master’s of science in nursing. And for those going back to school while juggling parenting, federal loan dollars can help beyond tuition, she noted.
“They help that mom be able to supplement child care for their child, so that they can have child care while they go to school,” she said. “There’s tuition, there’s books, there’s keeping the lights on. They’re feeding the family they’re getting to and from.”
The exclusion from the higher, “professional” category of student loan options is especially galling after nurses’ work during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Reding, of National Nurses United.
“We were all heroes in 2020. Now, what are we?” Reding asked. “It’s a slap in the face to the nurses that go to work every day doing our very best to care for our patients, even under very adverse conditions and even facing deadly viruses.”

Clarke, the registered nurse considering a post-bachelor’s degree, said nurses’ pandemic-era devotion influenced her own career path.
“When I saw the nurses and the health care workers really working hard for their communities and sacrificing a lot, I was really inspired by that,” Clarke said. “And that’s why I went to school.”

LifeWise is operating in more than 260 of the state’s 607 districts. It plans to be in about 300 school districts across the state by the end of the school year. 
In January, LifeWise was in about 160 Ohio school districts, making its growth this year a 62.5% increase. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This growth comes as Ohio school districts are now required to have a religious release time policy, which has helped pave the way for an expansion of LifeWise Academy. 
The new law took effect in April. Previously, the law merely permitted a religious release time policy. 
“The new release time religious education law in Ohio clarifies the rights for schools and parents to offer release time programs like LifeWise making the path to implementing these programs more straightforward for many districts,” LifeWise said in a statement to the Ohio Capital Journal. 
LifeWise is in 31 states and is approved to launch in six more states by the end of 2026. The nonprofit hopes to reach 100,000 students nationally in 2026. 
While critics of LifeWise are not surprised by the growth because of the new Ohio law, they have concerns. 
According to Education Week, at least 12 states require school districts to offer religious release time upon a parent’s request: Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
“It doesn’t seem like people are necessarily interested when you have to go change the laws because schools are telling you no and you’re taking that option away from them,” said Zach Parrish, a parent who had LifeWise file a lawsuit against him. “Of course, you’re going to grow.”  
Parrish now lives in Indiana, but his daughter was a student in Defiance City Schools in Northwest Ohio and she was bullied and ostracized for not attending LifeWise.
The United States Supreme Court upheld release time laws during the 1952 Zorach v. Clauson case, which allowed a school district to have students leave school for part of the day to receive religious instruction.
Religious release time instruction must meet three criteria: the courses must take place off school property, be privately funded, and students must have parental permission.
Northeast Ohio
LifeWise started a program at Vermilion Schools in Northeast Ohio this fall after the school district originally said no to LifeWise back in 2023, said Kitty Schwanitz, an organizer for the Secular Education Association.  
“If religion needs to be such a big part of their life, I think that they should take their kid to church, to Sunday school,” Schwanitz said. “I just think that local, organic religious instruction on parents time is best.”
The program in Vermilion currently only has three elementary students in it, she said. 
“It can’t be sustainable when you’re running numbers that low,” Parrish said. 
Schwanitz said some parents don’t know what they are getting into when they agree to let their children go to LifeWise. 
“A lot of (parents) aren’t looking at the fine print of what they’re signing up for,” she said. “And when they do they realize what their kids are being taught, and then they have to pull their kids, their kids are crying, and then they’re getting bullied. … It breaks my heart every time I read a story about another kid who is being bullied.” 
Schwanitz said her high school twins are not religious. 
“I really wanted my children to be raised without any pressure from any kind of religious organization at all,” she said. “A group like LifeWise would absolutely want to target my kids.”
Casey Bellis used to attend St. Mary Catholic Church in Vermilion, but was told by the pastor she was no longer welcome there after she started questioning why the pastor supported LifeWise. Now, she attends St. Peter Catholic Church in Huron. 
“Our pastor there is very much against (LifeWise),” Bellis said. 
St. Peter’s Pastor Rev. J. Douglas Garand wrote a letter to the parish in 2024 saying the church does not support LifeWise. 
“Let the local churches educate the member children of their communities of faith, in the ways of faith,” he wrote in the letter.

Matt Hollar’s daughters used to attend LifeWise at a Northwest Ohio school district.
“My older daughter — she was probably eight at the time, maybe nine — came home reciting Old Testament scripture, not understanding the ‘strict’ meaning, and certainly not capable at that age of interpreting a deeper meaning” Hollar said.
His daughter also told him she learned at LifeWise that the 2022 Pixar movie “Turning Red” was “against God’s teachings and should not be watched because it was focused on worshiping false idols.” 
“I didn’t agree and also thought it suggested that they were teaching my children at a very young age to question their own beliefs, and those I was trying to instill,” he said. 
“LifeWise makes it very clear in their own material that if the parents’ belief systems differ from LifeWise, the students are to assume that LifeWise is right and their parents, and anyone else, are wrong.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Lawyers with a reproductive rights initiative are asking the Ohio Supreme Court to intervene in a dispute against the Ohio Department of Health, in which they say the agency is withholding records related to the licensure of a clinic providing abortions.
Members of the Reproductive Rights Law Initiative at Case Western Reserve University joined with the ACLU of Ohio in a lawsuit filed Dec. 3 with the state’s highest court.
The groups said the department of health should be required to release public records related to the Toledo Women’s Center, after the agency “unreasonably delayed … granting their Jan. 2025 application to provide procedural abortions in addition to medication abortions,” the groups said in a press release.
“Transparency between citizens and government institutions remains a cornerstone of our democratic processes,” said Katie Corwin, legal fellow with the initiative. “Without it, we run the risk of losing trust and accountability.”
The center is regulated by the Ohio Department of Health as an ambulatory surgical facility.
According to the department’s database, a license for the center was issued June 24 of this year, and expires in June of 2026.
The center’s website notes a new service added, surgical abortions from five weeks to 17 weeks gestation.
The facility provides medication abortions up to 12 weeks, according to the center.

Corwin is listed as the plaintiff in the new complaint, in which she tells the court about nine public records request made starting in May of this year, asking for any emails and communications “sent or received that mention or refer to the Toledo Women’s Center” starting at the beginning of 2025.
The requests were made to the department’s chief of health care compliance, the bureau chief for the agency, and its bureau of regulatory operations, according to court documents.
She claims the Ohio Department of Health responded in June to the requests with “groundless objections” that the requests were “overly broad,” that Corwin requested “information rather than specific records” and that records were protected under attorney-client privilege.
One such rejection letter, dated June 5, said the request “does not identify specific records being sought with reasonable clarity and is too voluminous, vague, or indefinite to be properly acted on.”
“All of (the agency’s) objections are legally untenable,” Corwin said in her official complaint to the Ohio Supreme Court.
She asked the court to order that the agency provide her the records under Ohio’s Public Records Act.
Following the June denial, the attorney asked to meet with the department’s legal counsel, and submitted three “updated” requests.
In July, records were released to Corwin by the department from a previous records request, and the meeting was cancelled.
That same month, the Ohio Department of Health reiterated their objections to certain records requests, but legal counsel provided several email records “in the interest of transparency,” records that the legal counsel said the department “was able to identify based on the current wording of your request,” according to court documents.
After further back and forth between the agency, Corwin and another attorney from the initiative, the department’s legal counsel “declined to produce further emails … stating only that in ODH’s view (the requests) were ‘legally insufficient.'”
Corwin told the state supreme court that the Ohio Department of Health “has a clear legal duty” to provide the records under the public records law, and because the Toledo Women’s Center is regulated and licensed by the department.
Because of that oversight duty, the requests relate to the department of health’s “‘functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office’ and are therefore unquestionably public records.”
The Ohio Department of Health has 21 days to file a response to the complaint before the supreme court decides whether to take up the case.
If taken up by the court, the case would likely move into 2026 before further developments.
The last oral arguments of the year are scheduled for Dec. 9 and Dec. 10, and the court already has arguments scheduled through Jan. 8.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of a former Ohio State University doctor protested outside the school’s Board of Trustees meeting this past Thursday.
The university has already settled cases with nearly 300 survivors of Dr. Richard Strauss to the tune of $60 million. But hundreds more survivors have so far refused to settle.
In August, the federal judge overseeing the five remaining lawsuits sent the dispute to mediation.
“It has become obvious,” Judge Michael Watson wrote, “that any litigation victory for plaintiffs may be pyrrhic.”
“The best way for plaintiffs to close this horrific chapter of their lives, and for Ohio State to move forward as a respectable institution of higher education,” he continued, “is through a mutual resolution short of trial.”
Survivors have deposed several prominent public figures in relation to the case, including Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan — an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State during Strauss’ tenure, former athletic director Andy Geiger and two-time Heisman trophy winner Archie Griffin, who served as assistant athletic director.

But they’ve so far been unable to depose Les Wexner, the former L Brands CEO, Jeffrey Epstein confidante and perhaps Ohio State’s greatest benefactor.
Wexner’s first term on the board of trustees overlapped with Strauss’ tenure and he was chairman of the board in 1996 when disciplinary proceedings against the doctor saw him barred from treating patients in the athletics department and student health services.
The doctor remained a tenured faculty member until 1998, though, and he quickly set up a private off-campus clinic where he continued to sexually abuse patients.
When he retired, Strauss was granted emeritus status.

Survivors’ protest
Outside the trustees meeting, survivors like Stephen Snyder-Hill waved signs reading “Where’s Wexner.”
Board chairman, John Zeiger, used to be Wexner’s attorney. His son and law partner Matthew Zeiger now represents Wexner.
“I think our biggest beef right now is that there’s a lot of really gross internal conflicts, in our opinion,” Snyder-Hill said.
“Because Zeiger, his kid, represents Wexner, who’s on our list to be subpoenaed, and his kid is not letting him take a subpoena, so they’re just evading the law, and he sits in there on the board.”
Thursday’s meeting was the first they’ve attended since OSU President Ted Carter assumed his office.
But Snyder-Hill didn’t sound optimistic about his impact on court-ordered mediation. He pointed to Carter’s comments to The Lantern early this year about a different lawsuit.
The school was forced to move hundreds of students after finding mold in a residential tower. But when he was asked about a lawsuit tied to the incident, Carter said “most people are going to find we don’t settle.”
Adding to survivors’ frustration is the recent hire of E. Gordon Gee. The former OSU president led the school at the time of disciplinary actions against Strauss, and the doctor twice appealed to Gee directly in hopes of having his privileges to see students on-campus reinstated.
Gee’s administration didn’t let Strauss back, but neither did it pursue the matter further.
Tom Lisy speaking to reporters. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)
When attorneys working on OSU’s internal investigation spoke to Gee, he couldn’t recall the correspondence from Strauss. But Gee said his staffers “would have briefed him on Strauss’ situation at the time, and that he ‘would have directed them to handle it.’”
“And then Ted Carter calls him his ‘wing man?’” Snyder-Hill said in disbelief. “I’m like, that’s a poor choice of words right now, especially if he had any knowledge of this back then, and he did.”
Tom Lisy graduated from Ohio State in 1991. As a freshman on the wrestling team, he explained, Strauss assaulted him on two occasions. Like Snyder-Hill, he isn’t expecting mediation to reach an agreement that leaves both sides feeling whole.
“I don’t think it’s possible for us to feel whole,” he said. “I mean, based on what we’ve been through as students, and based on now what we’ve been through as alumni.”
“On the front side, they had a chance to try to mend fences, in a sense, and that time has passed.” Lisy added.
He sees the university’s obstinance as a misguided exercise in brand protection. The school pursued a bid to dismiss cases under the statute limitations all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But after the justices declined to hear Ohio State’s appeal the cases were able to go forward.
That pyrrhic victory Judge Watson talked about? That’s on school leaders, Lisy said.
“They’ve already done damage the university. They’ve done damage to the student body. They’ve done damage to the image,” he said. “When they first found out about Strauss, that was the time to do something, and they didn’t do it.”

The meeting
After an hour outside in the cold, the demonstrators filed inside to the meeting — grumbling somewhat at school officials asking them to remove their signs’ wooden handles.
They stood in the back quietly holding their signs while President Carter read his report and the board moved through its agenda. There were no outbursts and the whole thing was over in less than half an hour.
Any hopes of speaking directly to President Carter were disappointed. He left through a back door. Board chair John Zeiger declined to speak to the press.
In a written statement, university spokesman Ben Johnson noted the school has already settled with more than half of those who have come forward with claims.
“All male students who filed lawsuits have been offered the opportunity to settle,” he wrote. “In addition, the university continues to cover the cost of professionally certified counseling services and other medical treatment, including reimbursement for counseling and treatment received in the past.”
“Ohio State led the effort to investigate and expose Richard Strauss, and we express our deep regret and apologies to all who experienced Strauss’ abuse,” Johnson added.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The Kansas Republican Party has pickled itself in a brackish brine of racism, homophobia and intolerance.
Officials can dissemble all they want, but the party can’t hope to represent everyday Kansans while tasting so sour. Poorly canned pickles can give you botulism, remember.
This distasteful metaphor suggested itself as the party staggered from embarrassment to embarrassment in recent months. You’ll recall the racist and white supremacist texts shared by young Republicans. GOP officials condemned the rhetoric. But on Nov. 28, the state party’s social media accounts posted a screed against democratic Gov. Laura Kelly from Ellis County GOP chairman Adam Peters.
Kansas Reflector readers might remember him as a central figure in our 2023 Church and State series. In recordings obtained by Kansas Reflector, Peters called for turning Kansas into a conservative sanctuary.
“If you can make it hostile to that group of people, that small sliver of society, and have them move elsewhere, that does a huge amount to shut this down,” he said of liberal Kansans.
While decrying “Antifa tactics,” Peters also told his audience: “We need to use the tools that are at our disposal. You know, if we look in scripture, there was a time when the nation of Israel had to take up arms in defense of themselves.”
He offered an offensive jumble of takes about race, suggesting all humans shared a common ancestry while saying “the main reason why Black suspects are disproportionately killed by the police is they disproportionately tried to kill the police.” He hinted that pastors who supported LGBTQ+ people had signed contracts with Satan.
The Ellis County party tried to deny that Peters had made such statements. But they were recorded for all to hear and judge.
No sane party seeking to appeal to mainstream voters would elevate someone like Peters. His apparent beliefs, as reported more than two years ago, should raise alarm bells for anyone. On the other hand, he said mean things about Kelly, so perhaps all was forgiven.
I reached out to state Republican Party Chairwoman Danedri Herbert for comment Friday evening. She didn’t respond by press time.
Meanwhile, one of the young Republicans at the center of the texting scandal made an unwelcome return to public view. The New York Times, of all outlets, elevated William Hendrix in a bewildering profile from Sabrina Tavernise and Georgia Gee. The organization’s former vice chairman used the words “n–ga” and “n–guh” and noted that “Missouri doesn’t like f–s.” I’m not sure why the Times decided to broadcast Hendrix’s self justifications across the nation. A slow news day, perhaps?
Hendrix, apparently unlike those of us who don’t text racist epithets to one another, just wants to support his family and live his life. The rest of us don’t have the opportunity to have our profiles boosted by the nation’s newspaper of record.
Regardless of my quibbles, state GOP leaders promptly exiled Hendrix and dissolved the Young Republicans after Politico exposed texts. They destroyed his future in the party. Yet just a few weeks later, they elevated Peters, whose comments were made at a public forum and shared throughout the state.
I’ve written this before and I’ll write it again: The Kansas Republican Party cannot have it both ways. It cannot claim to despise discrimination while tolerating a host of hatreds within its ranks.
Don’t believe me? Try Republican condemnation of supposedly homophobic remarks directed toward Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchison. Its detestation of homophobia lasts until the point when lawmakers are asked to support gay children. The Kansas GOP also opposes racism, until a Black Democrat calls out double standards on the House floor and gets hauled into a disciplinary hearing.
Not all Republicans behave this way or believe these things. That’s what makes it bad.
When I lived for more than a decade in New Hampshire, I knew prominent Republicans. They believed in racial equality. They supported gay rights. They supported fiscal discipline, personal moderation and loathing of income taxes. They would have unhesitatingly purged their beloved party of the kind of vile nihilism you see in Kansas.
I might not have agreed with New Hampshire Republicans’ ideology. But their lack of overt hate sure made them more appealing. I suspect swing voters liked them, too.
The First Amendment still applies, of course. Anyone should feel free to believe anything they want as long as it does not involve physically harming or threatening others. Political parties have the same freedom. However, every one of us has the choice to coddle or confront. If members of your coalition hold offensive and destructive beliefs, you can make it clear they’re not welcome. Republicans can survive and thrive without white supremacists, homophobes and Groypers.
 If the Republican brand has truly been pickled beyond palatability, voters can make their own choice. Pick a fresh cucumber and start again.

(Photo by Denis Smith)Bob Dylan got it right years ago. “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,” the folk music icon opined, particularly when it comes to detecting the views of Ohio school board members.
Indeed, there wasn’t a meteorologist in sight when more than 6,500 school board members, superintendents, and district treasurers gathered at the Columbus Convention Center for the annual Capital Conference of the Ohio School Boards Association.  
According to reports, attendees represented 89% of the state’s 607 school districts and provide a good sample to gauge the level of current thinking among school boards and their administrative leadership about the major issues facing public education.
Ready for a surprise? 
The top issue facing Ohio schools isn’t a shortage of bus drivers, scarce substitute teachers, or funding for aging school buses. 
It’s the expanded universal private school voucher program that is devastating the long-range viability of public education and diverting more than $1 billion annually from the state treasury to support private and religious schools.
That concern about dwindling state support for public education came through loud and clear from school board members who stopped by the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding and Vouchers Hurt Ohio exhibit booth to offer their concerns about the expansion of vouchers and the harm they inflict on public schools. 
As a volunteer at the conference for the last fourteen years, there is no question that the response from board members I spoke with last week about the Ohio legislature’s continued bad behavior directed at public education was the strongest during this time period. 
A few examples:
“I’m a lifelong Republican,” a school board member from Southwest Ohio told me, “but the harm being done to public education by the legislature has to stop.” 
He spoke to me as we stood in front of an easel that displayed the heart of the lawsuit against educational vouchers and the legislature’s unconstitutional support for religious schools.
Another board member, also from Southwest Ohio, stopped by the Ohio E&A/Vouchers Hurt Ohio exhibit booth to express her strong feelings about the voucher expansion and its support of religious schools. 
As a board member, she related, “I’ve personally supported Catholic schools over the years, but vouchers are wrong and are harming public education.”
That board member’s words reflect the general mood of the attendees who represent a cross-section of Ohioans from rural, urban, and suburban areas. 
This year, they are more forthcoming on how they feel about vouchers. 
Here’s why.
Display seen at Ohio School Board Association Conference. (Photo by Denis Smith)
On June 24, Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Jaiza Page ruled in a 47-page decision that educational vouchers are violative of the state constitution because they create multiple school systems rather than a common system open to all children, fail to adequately fund a thorough and efficient system, and transfer public funds to religious schools in violation of Article VI, Section 2. 
The plaintiffs had argued that more than 90% of the private schools in the state are religious institutions, thus a clear constitutional violation.
The ruling supported the plaintiffs on three of the five counts in the lawsuit. 
Judge Page’s decision was appealed by the State Defendants and will be considered by the 10th District Court of Appeals. 
Ultimately, the case will be decided by the Ohio Supreme Court.
An added incentive driving more districts to join the lawsuit was the inaction of the legislature to address the Cupp-Patterson funding plan that was introduced into the state budget in 2022.  
William Phillis, a former deputy state superintendent of schools and executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding, weighed in on the legislature’s neglect of duty in maintaining the constitution’s requirement to guarantee “a thorough and efficient system of common schools.”
“There were high hopes that the Cupp-Patterson plan would be fully phased in for FY2026 and beyond, but the legislature scuttled the plan and punished school districts in a plethora of ways. Meanwhile, the trial court judge ruled EdChoice vouchers unconstitutional. The court decision and the legislature’s failure to adopt a completely phased-in Cupp-Patterson plan turned many school district leaders toward the EdChoice voucher litigation. So interest in the litigation was at a higher level among school district leadership personnel than in previous years.”
Phillis has led the fight for adequate school funding since the landmark 1997 DeRolph v Ohio decision, where the state Supreme Court found that reliance on local property taxes to fund schools created inherently unequal educational outcomes because of the varying level of assessed value among local school districts. 
His role during the last quarter-century as a watchdog on the legislature to ensure that schools are properly funded has made him an eminent figure who inspired the formation of other groups to assist him in supporting public education.
Shortly after the conclusion of the OSBA conference, I spoke with Jeanne Melvin, President of Public Education Partners (Disclosure: I am also a PEP member) who, like me, also volunteered in the exhibit booth. She also saw a decided change in mood among board members, particularly those from rural districts, where their constituents don’t have private schools to choose from but see larger school districts that have nearby private and religious schools benefiting from this decided imbalance.
“I have had the opportunity to speak with school board members, superintendents, and school treasurers in the Vouchers Hurt Ohio booth at the Ohio School Boards Conference for a few years,” Melvin stated. 
“In the past, I was disappointed at the number of education leaders that told me school vouchers were here to stay, and there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.” 
That was then. But things have changed among board members and school leaders. 
Melvin has also seen a change in the prevailing wind direction.
“Ever since the judge ruled in June that Ohio’s EdChoice voucher program is unconstitutional, opinion has changed. School district leaders and residents finally realize that the voucher agenda was created by a legislature that seeks to privatize our system of public schools, and they are angry. The success of pro-public education board candidates and school levies this election cycle has ignited a passion to fight back.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Indeed, school boards are fighting back, and with the recent election that saw a number of school board candidates defeat conservatives who were otherwise acquiescent on the voucher imbroglio, even more districts are expected to join the anti-voucher lawsuit.
“Parents are concerned about the long-term effects of district tax money being funneled to unaccountable private schools,” Jeanne Melvin think. “ Taxpayers are speaking up and demanding that their local public schools be protected.”
As the Voucher Hurt Ohio banner at the OSBA Capital Conference proclaimed, “We are winning!”
Those who support their community’s schools, the bedrock of so many zipcodes on the map, would agree. 
Let’s hope that the Supreme Court will stand in support of defending the Ohio Constitution and its clear language in affirming that “no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any parts of the school funds of this State.”
If the Supremes have trouble with comprehending these unambiguous words, they need to be enrolled in a Science of Reading class. 
The question about whether the universal voucher program is constitutional or not means that the Supreme Court must rise above politics and apply the law as it is clearly spelled out in Article VI, Sec. 2 of the Ohio Constitution.

WILMINGTON —  It’s time for the Governor’s  Volunteer Service Awards as we enters the holiday season. State leaders are urging residents to take a moment to recognize the thousands of volunteers whose time, talent and compassion fuel community programs year-round — from food banks and senior centers to youth sports, arts organizations, environmental groups and neighborhood nonprofits.
That spirit of service is at the heart of the 2026 Delaware Governor’s Volunteer Service Awards, with nominations now open through January 10, 2026. The awards, now in their 44th year, honor individuals and groups whose work strengthens communities across all three counties.
“Every day in Delaware, volunteers step forward without expecting recognition,” state officials said in announcing the launch of this year’s nomination cycle. “These awards allow us to shine a light on those who make our state stronger, kinder and more connected.”
Celebrating the People Behind Delaware’s Volunteer Network
Nonprofits and community groups across the state say the need for volunteers is never greater than during the holiday season, when food insecurity rises, seniors face greater isolation and families turn to local organizations for support.
From youth mentors and environmental stewards to medical volunteers, library helpers and neighborhood organizers, Delaware’s volunteer corps reflects a broad range of skills and passions. Past honorees have included:


Adult volunteers leading long-term mentoring and community health projects.


Youth volunteers creating school-based service programs and organizing donation drives.


Service groups and nonprofits coordinating food distribution, literacy initiatives and environmental cleanup efforts.


Lifetime achievers who have spent decades improving their communities through consistent, selfless service.


Over the past four decades, hundreds of Delawareans have been honored as role models who inspire others to give back.
How the 2026 Nomination Process Works
The Governor’s Volunteer Service Awards are administered by the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) through the State Office of Volunteerism.
Key details include:


Nominations opened: December 2, 2025


Deadline: January 10, 2026


Award Ceremony: May 2026


Eligibility: Individuals, youth, groups, and organizations that have performed exceptional volunteer service in Delaware.


Categories typically include:


Adult Volunteer


Youth Volunteer


Group/Organization


Lifetime Achievement




Nominations may highlight contributions in areas such as community well-being, youth and families, health services, arts and culture, environmental protection, or nonprofit capacity-building.
Officials encourage Delawareans to nominate volunteers who have demonstrated leadership, creativity, compassion and measurable impact in their communities.
A Call to Recognize Local Heroes
As holiday events, charity drives and community gatherings continue throughout December, state leaders say this is an ideal time to showcase the importance of volunteerism.
“Delaware’s volunteers are the heartbeat of our state,” officials said. “By nominating someone for the Governor’s Volunteer Service Awards, you’re helping to tell the stories of people who give of themselves quietly, consistently and with tremendous heart.”
Nomination forms and full guidelines are available through the State Office of Volunteerism.

Surely, those headlines evoked some rage — a word that these days covers the gamut from snit to, well, actual rage.
Speaking of which, we also had this recently: The Oxford English Dictionary announced that “rage bait” was its Word of the Year. If you’re keeping score at home, the dictionary folks define rage bait as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular webpage or social media account.” Chuffing for clicks, if you will.
No word on whether any lexicographer among the judges had cast a vote for “waste, fraud and abuse,” a tried and true bit of tedious phraseology too often used to slash and burn valuable government programs, which help millions. Babies and bathwater, that sort of thing.
Food as a ‘bargaining chip’
Any thought on “waste, fraud, and abuse” also lent itself to this space revisiting the current administration’s continued occupation of the moral lowground, a place it found to its liking during an extended government shutdown. Withholding food became a cruel negotiating strategy during those dark days.
The White House is back … and food is once again a bargaining chip.
Since last summer, the U.S. Department of Agriculture — citing efforts to eliminate the aforementioned “waste, fraud and abuse” — has demanded that states forward the names, dates of birth, home addresses, Social Security numbers and benefit totals of those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. About 42 million Americans, including 150,000 Nebraskans, depend on SNAP to put food on their tables.
Twenty-eight states with Republican governors — including Nebraska — have forwarded the data. The others have resisted, backed by a federal judge’s October decision barring the feds from collecting the information. Now, USDA has given the recalcitrants until this week to send the particulars or it would start withholding SNAP payments in those states, which happen to have Democratic governors. Go figure. 
Fraud does happen
To be clear: We have waste, fraud and abuse in government. SNAP is no exception. No one is arguing otherwise. USDA hasn’t released verifiable numbers but has thrown out figures gleaned from the states that have reported data to the feds to make its case for the rest of the data. Running those amounts rounded out to about 3% of recipients misusing funds. 
Also, the Government Accounting Office reports that EBT benefit cards, which lack chip technology, are prime targets for theft through cloning, skimming and other schemes. How obtaining states’ recipients data addresses those problems remains unclear.
Nor does the latest full frontal federal foray into combatting real or imagined financial inefficiencies inspire much confidence. The now-defunct Department of Government Efficiency, unaffectionately known as DOGE, promised taxpayers $1 trillion in savings by ferreting out “waste, fraud and abuse.” By the time the coders-doing-the-work-of-auditors logged out, however, the net gain wasn’t in the ballpark. DOGE itself estimated the number was $180 billion, but others, including NPR, could verify only a $2.3 billion savings.
Think about impacts
The cuts come with human costs, too. A Boston University epidemiologist and infectious disease researcher estimated that after DOGE shuttered the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, in July, more than 600,000 people had already died as a result of the cut.
Finally, wide and polychromatic is the palette of those who benefit from government programs through direct benefits, tax breaks, health insurance programs, subsidies, bailouts and forgivable loans. All those programs mean our tax dollars benefit people from the most vulnerable, who live paycheck to paycheck or homeless shelter to homeless shelter, to those inC-suites noodling how to use tax laws and regulatory processes to increase their bottom lines, to the millions of us in between. Surely we need all their data, too?
But that’s not really the question or the point. This is: Somehow, under the guise of finding the wasteful, the fraudulent and the abusive allegedly fleecing the USDA, our best idea is to threaten the food security of millions of Americans? 
We can’t do any better administratively? Morally? If that’s the bait that ignites rage, perhaps more of us should take it, insisting as we do that those with the power to find solutions to modern problems do so without the cruelty.

Cleo Fields was one of three candidates to sign up to run for the new 6th Congressional district race.  (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Board of Ethics fined Congressman Cleo Fields $2,500 Friday for not submitting a report documenting the remaining funds and debts for the campaign account from his Public Service Commission run more than 20 years ago. 
Fields, who was elected to his current term in Congress in 2024, declined to comment on the fine when reached by phone Friday. 
The Baton Rouge Democrat lost the District 3 public service commissioner race to Lambert Boissiere in a 2004 runoff election. The missing report, due in February of this year, would have documented any spending or debt forgiveness in 2024 from that campaign. 
For several years, elected officials have been required to file reports for old election accounts as long as more than $2,500 in contributions or debts remain in them. In June, Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers adjusted this reporting standard, raising the threshold to $5,000. 

Fields’s old account meets the standards for reporting regardless of the threshold in place. At the end of 2023, it had $3,470 in leftover contributions and $317,000 in outstanding loans made from Fields personally, according to a report he previously submitted. 

Through a letter, the congressman had asked the ethics board to waive the fine. Its members declined to do so at the recommendation of the ethics board staff. 

The board did not discuss why they chose not to waive or reduce Fields’ fine, but they frequently turn down such requests if the elected official or candidate has previously missed deadlines for campaign finance reporting. 

Fields’ had missed a campaign finance deadline in 2019, when he filed a report for his successful Louisiana Senate election 10 days late. He also paid late fees when he missed campaign finance reporting deadlines by two months each for state senate elections in 1995, 1997 and 1999, according to the ethics board staff. Those fines totaled $2,980 and were paid in full years ago.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_1620-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 02:56:24.959780

Overview of the Redding Consortium
The Redding Consortium for Educational Equity is a state-appointed advisory body established in 2019 under Delaware House Bill 222. Its primary mandate is to recommend policies and practices to the Governor and General Assembly to improve educational equity and outcomes for Pre-K through grade 12 students in Wilmington and northern New Castle County. A core focus is redistricting the fragmented school boundaries in the area, which currently involve portions of four districts—Brandywine, Colonial, Christina, and Red Clay—serving Wilmington students. This fragmentation has led to long bus rides, resource inequities, and challenges in serving high-needs students, including English learners and low-income families. The consortium’s efforts build on prior failed attempts, such as the 2015 Wilmington Education Improvement Commission (WEIC) plan.
In addition to redistricting, the consortium supports broader initiatives like expanding early childhood education, in-school health services, wraparound programs (e.g., before/after-school and summer supports), teacher premium pay in high-needs schools, and specialized magnet programs in elementary schools. For fiscal year 2025, it allocated a $14.6 million budget, including $3.7 million for pre-K expansion, $5.7 million for health and extended-time services, and $1.6 million specifically for redistricting planning related to the Christina School District.
Redistricting Plans for New Castle County School Districts
The consortium’s redistricting work aims to consolidate districts, reduce socioeconomic segregation, improve access to resources, and shorten commutes for Wilmington students (who are often bused to suburban schools as far as Glasgow High School). An interim plan was approved in May 2024, recommending the removal of Christina School District from serving Wilmington (due to its non-contiguous boundaries and low enrollment from the city—only 41% of potential students opt in). This interim framework outlines boundary shifts, immediate supports for city schools, a public engagement timeline, and policy reforms.
As of November 2025, the consortium has narrowed its options to three models for reshaping northern New Castle County districts. A vote to select one is scheduled for December 16, 2025, followed by drafting a full plan in January 2026, public hearings in February (at least one per affected district, with two in Wilmington), and State Board of Education review from March to May 2026. Implementation, if approved by the General Assembly and Governor via joint resolution, would not occur until 3–5 years later (likely 2028–2030). The models exclude Colonial and Christina from future Wilmington service in most cases, aligning with the “River Plan” supported by Wilmington city officials for geographic proximity and reduced travel times.
Key Redistricting Models Under Consideration
Two-District Option (Brandywine and Red Clay Split)
Splits the City of Wilmington between Brandywine and Red Clay districts (e.g., along Market Street, with Brandywine taking the east and Red Clay the west). Brandywine and Red Clay remain separate; Colonial and Christina serve only suburban areas.
Metropolitan Wilmington District
Merges Brandywine, Red Clay, and Wilmington (including Christina’s four city schools: Bayard, Pritchett, Pulaski, Stubbs) into one new district. Colonial and Christina continue serving suburbs only.
Northern New Castle County Consolidated District
Full merger of all four districts (Brandywine, Christina, Colonial, Red Clay) into one mega-district covering northern New Castle County.
These models must align with 13 stipulations in Delaware Code, including reducing low-income student concentration, enhancing supports for at-risk students, and ensuring cooperation from districts and charters (e.g., data sharing on students, finances, and facilities). The selected model will incorporate community feedback from ongoing town halls, such as the December 4, 2025, Christina Board workshop.
Broader Equity Initiatives Tied to Redistricting
While redistricting is central, the consortium’s plans emphasize holistic supports:

Early Learning and Wraparounds: Expanding pre-K slots and funding before/after-school programs.
Teacher Incentives: Premium pay for educators in high-needs schools, building on Christina-Wilmington pilots.
Specialized Programs: Magnet options in elementaries and better English learner services.
Collaborations: Initiatives like Boost ’22–’26 for cross-district graduation improvements and the Wilmington Learning Collaborative for targeted city supports.

Political divisions persist—e.g., between Gov. Meyer’s preference for consolidation and concerns from former Governor (now, Mayor of Wilmington) John Carney’s allies—but the December vote marks a pivotal step after years of delays.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)ST PETERSBURG — Could Gwen Graham add heft to David Jolly’s candidacy for governor by becoming his running mate in Florida next year?
That question occurred when the former Tallahassee-based U.S. representative appeared with Jolly last week during a political rally in Pinellas County that drew 400-plus attendees.
Jolly has been crisscrossing the Sunshine State since entering the Democratic race for governor in June, and the event at 535 Nova — a wedding venue — was his 130th public gathering since he entered the contest, but the first time he appeared with Graham, the closest thing to Florida Democratic Party royalty. She’s a daughter of Bob Graham, the former Florida governor and U.S. senator who died last year at 87.
In an interview before the Thursday event, Gwen Graham, who served in Congress with Jolly from 2015-2017, said it was a “no-brainer” that she would support the former Republican for governor.
“I would not be standing here if I didn’t know he could win,” she said. “This election is too important. We’ve got to have a candidate in November who can win so we can start reversing the damage that has been done to the state that I love and my father loved, and David can win. So, I’m going to do whatever I can to help him do that.”
Many political analysts considered Graham the favorite to capture the Democratic nomination for governor in 2018, but she ended up losing to then Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by three percentage points in that year’s primary election. She went on to serve in President Joe Biden’s administration as assistant secretary for legislation and congressional affairs at the U.S. Department of Education from 2021 to 2025.
In introducing Jolly to the audience in St. Petersburg last week, Graham said she was nervous because it was her first public appearance since the death of her father, who served as Florida’s 38th governor from 1979 to 1987 and in the U.S. Senate from 1987 to 2005.
“I hear my dad’s voice in David’s commitment to the values that I have grown up with and lived,” she said in her speech. 
“I hear David’s voice talking about what he cares about for the future of this state. So, while David knows this race will be difficult, the moment is too important. We must all stand together and do our part to define what Florida will look like as a state for the next century.”
Jolly deflected when asked before the event whether he was considering Graham to serve as his running mate, but did say, “We’re going to name a lieutenant governor candidate very early. We’re not going to wait until the primary. And I hope we see Gwen Graham in office again in the state of Florida.”
Considering a Jolly-Graham ticket
Longtime Hillsborough County Democratic strategist Victor DiMaio served at one time as a press secretary for Bob Graham. Having Gwen Graham on Jolly’s ticket makes sense on several levels, he said.
“Gwen would be an excellent choice if that’s what [Jolly] decides to do,” he said. “It didn’t hurt other governors who have selected women as lieutenant governors.”
Angela Birdsong, president of the Hillsborough County Democratic Black Caucus, believes Gillum would have defeated Ron DeSantis in 2018 if he had selected Graham, instead of Chris King, to serve as his running mate.
“She would bring in more conservative Democrats, and independents would love her,” Birdsong said of Graham’s appeal in 2026. When asked if that ticket might prove to be too moderate for Florida Democrats, Birdsong disagreed. “I’m with Jasmine Crockett — I think that we’re going to have to run some vanilla candidates for a while.”
(Crockett. a progressive Democratic member of Congress from Texas, said in an interview on Sirius/XM radio in May that, following the Democratic Party’s losses to Donald Trump with Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, “we just want to win.”
(She added, “So, there’s a lot of people that are like, ‘You know what? Like, let’s go find the safest white boy we can find.’ I mean, I’m just saying.”)
Some political consultants believe a Democratic gubernatorial ticket consisting of Jolly, a former Republican, and Graham, a political moderate, may offer a general election appeal to a Florida electorate that has moved considerably to the political right during the past eight years.
But it might be a dead letter within the more progressive precincts of the Florida Democratic Party.
Carolina Ampudia is a former chair of the Democratic Progressive Caucus in Florida. She sees a Jolly-Graham ticket as “a pathetic retreat, not a step forward.”
“Jolly has a Republican record and ties to Scientology. Graham voted to fast-track the Keystone pipeline and built her career on centrism. Neither of them represents the communities that have been fighting on the frontlines for labor rights, racial justice, LGBTQ+ protections, public education, or environmental survival,” she said in a text message.
“Florida doesn’t need a rebranded Republican and a legacy name,” she continued. “We need leadership that reflects the courage and clarity of the people — not the fears of consultants and donors.”
Florida’s last two elected governors, Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott, both named women as their running mates (DeSantis selected Jeanette Nuñez in 2018 and Scott picked Jennifer Carroll in 2010). Charlie Crist selected female running mates in his two unsuccessful bids as a Democrat for governor in 2014 and 2022 (Annette Taddeo in ’14 and Karla Hernández-Mats in ’22).
Meanwhile, discussion about a potential running mate for Jolly comes amid a challenge for the Democratic nomination by Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, who announced his candidacy a month ago. No major polls comparing the two Democrats have been published since his entry.
Uphill climb
On the GOP side, southwest Florida U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds is dominating in the polling. According to a survey of 800 likely Republican voters conducted by Florida pollster Ryan Tyson for the American Promise last month, Donalds, who has been endorsed by President Trump, received 43% support while a majority of the electorate (51%) remained unsure. Former House Speaker Paul Renner received 2% of the vote. Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, who has not formally entered the race, received 1%.
A poll conducted by the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab of 728 likely voters between Donalds and Jolly in October (before Demings entered the contest) showed Donalds leading both Jolly and Demings by double digits.
The eventual Democratic nominee will be a decided underdog. Florida has not elected a Democrat to lead the state since Lawton Chiles in 1994.
Even before he entered the race for governor in June, Jolly had been talking about affordability, which has emerged as a buzzword in U.S. politics following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayor’s race last month.
Thursday night, Jolly said concerns about the quality of life for everyday Floridians encompasses “more than affordability.”
“Affordability is, ‘Am I going to be able to afford rent or housing this week or this month.’ That is real. That’s a crisis. But we’re at a generational inflection point,” he said. 
“I think that if Republicans continue with their policies, we’re going to lose the middle in the state of Florida and people are going to begin leaving at a quicker rate than we’re already seeing.”
Among the issues he addressed during his 50-minute-plus speech was the state’s universal school choice program, which expanded significantly in 2023 and was found by a state audit to feature “a myriad of accountability problems.”
“They don’t have to provide an individual education program,” Jolly said of private schools that accept state tuition subsidies.
“They don’t have to provide excellence in academics. Trigonometry in the 10th grade. Access to the trades. Access to the arts. They don’t have to provide any of that because there’s no standards on our choice schools. And so, just like Jeb Bush 25 years ago made the argument that he’s siding with Florida’s kids and families, guess what? Now we are. Because he used to say that public schools were leaving the kids behind. Now are choice schools leaving your kids behind? That’s what’s happening in the state of Florida.”
A plan to add funding for public education 
Jolly has proposed a “10-year renaissance” in public education, advocating for a proposed constitutional amendment that would steer a portion of tourist development tax receipts into public education to pay teachers 30% more.
Tourist development taxes are levied in 62 of  Florida’s 67 counties with rates ranging from 2% to 6% on sales. State law requires at least 40% of all tourist development tax revenues collected in a county to be spent to promote and advertise tourism.
“We build convention centers with it. We advertise beaches on the Chicago ‘L’ in January. … But guess what? We don’t have a crisis of convention centers in the state of Florida, we have a crisis in education,” Jolly said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-2-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 00:58:13.641834

I am the mother of a caring 11-year-old boy who loves screen time, and it is a constant struggle to get him to disconnect from the screens. During the COVID-19 pandemic, screens became essential for school and socialization, but the habit never truly ended.  Now, children use electronics more than ever at home, in classrooms, and during downtime. 
I often see parents, including myself, overwhelmed by the challenge of setting limits. This reality highlights the urgent need for healthcare providers to offer families practical tools and resources, like the American Academy of Pediatrics’ (AAP) Family Media Plan (FMP), to help balance technology use from the comfort of one’s home. Supporting families through using this tool can make a meaningful difference in restoring health and awareness in reducing screen time.
Excessive screen time has become a growing public health concern, and I have witnessed how this affects children’s health. On average, children spend four to six hours daily on screens, exceeding the AAP’s recommendations of no more than one to two hours per day.  
Following COVID-19, digital use for both learning and leisure has continued to rise, contributing to obesity, poor sleep, poor posture, myopia, and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Many families struggle to manage screen use, highlighting the need for structured guidance such as the AAP’s family medical plan. 


Some may argue that screen time is an unavoidable part of modern education and social connection. On average, the typical child receives their first phone at 11 years old. Certainly, technology can support learning, creativity, and communication when used appropriately. However, the problem arises when recreational use exceeds healthy limits, leading to negative effects on sleep, attention, and physical health. The goal of the family medical plan is not to eliminate technology but to find the balance in its intentional use. By setting clear boundaries, families can ensure their benefits while reducing harm to children.
A policy-based solution to excessive screen time is the integration of the AAP’s family medical plan into primary care practice. Using this evidence-based approach may help families in setting screen time limits, scheduling tech-free activities, and promoting healthier digital habits.. By implementing the plan during routine wellness visits, providers can educate parents, support prevention, and reduce potential risks such as obesity and behavioral issues that come with excessive screen time. Standardizing its use and plan across pediatric settings ensures consistent guidance for all families and helps children reduce the risk of future mental and physical challenges.

It’s a true story, and it’s the basis for the children’s book And Tango Makes Three. 
The book tells the story of two male chinstrap penguins, Roy and Silo, who built a nest, took turns brooding an egg, and raised the female chick that hatched from it named Tango. The message of love and its depiction of diverse families, however, proved too controversial. Parents, school boards, and other groups across the United States attacked the book, arguing that its representation of a same-sex relationship was “anti-family” and unsuitable for young children. 



This book, and thousands of others, have faced widespread attacks across the United States and in local communities, signalling an alarming trend toward censorship of gender identity, sexual orientation, and marginalized groups. 
Book banning is not a new phenomenon. The United States has a long and reprehensible history of book banning. Historically, books were banned on the grounds of sexual imagery, violence, or obscenity, though defining these terms remains controversial and debated today. This legacy is powerful, and though the practice is not new, it should never be normalized. 
The rise of book banning in the 21st century is startling, as bans have extended farther in reach and scale in recent years. Book banning in the United States is just one example of a striking turn to authoritarianism. For instance, the anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiment that often drives book banning threatens democratic norms. This is emblematic of broader authoritarian attacks in the United States against racial justice, reproductive rights, political dissent, and more. 
Since 2021, there have been 23,000 book bans in public schools in the United States. A national study carried out by PEN America found that in just one academic year, from 2024 to 2025, there were 6,780 instances of book bans. Of these titles, a large number of books dealt with LGBTQIA+ topics or had LGBTQIA+ protagonists or characters. 

Elizabeth York

Another study found that, out of 1,154 books banned in a nine-month period, 33% dealt with LGBTQIA+ topics, and 41% of the fiction novels and non-fiction books featured protagonists of color. 
But the problem of book banning can be felt much closer to home. 
In March of this year, in my hometown of Suffield, Connecticut, the Library Commission considered a proposal that would remove books with subject matter related to gender identity from the children’s section of Kent Memorial Library. 
This is not the first time the small town has seen controversy over its censorship in the public library. In 2023, the Director of Kent Memorial Library, Julie Styles, resigned from her role on the basis of political interference.
Suffield First Selectman Colin Moll forced Styles to remove the book “What Are Your Words” from display in the children’s section of Kent Memorial Library after complaints from town residents about its content on gender-inclusive pronouns.
 In a farewell letter published in The Suffield Observer, Styles wrote that she was also asked to tag all LGBTQIA+ books with warning labels and to limit displays that featured books on current affairs or that were representative of marginalized communities. 
In 2022, Connecticut saw 29 reported library title challenges according to the American Library Association. Just one year later, that number was 117. 
These numbers are alarming. More worrying, though, is that they actually are modest measurements. Underreporting of book bans and challenges means that books continue to be censored with little to no coverage from the media, leaving us with little knowledge of the true extent of book bans both in Connecticut and at the national level. 
Statistics are telling, but they don’t speak about the child who sees their identity weaponized. 
“When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative, or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part,” says ​​Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop, ​​professor emerita of Education at The Ohio State University and known as the “mother of” multicultural children’s literature.
Recently, the Connecticut General Assembly passed legislation containing provisions on public libraries’ collection and review policies. After the provisions were added to the state budget, the law required school boards across the state to adopt various policies on issues such as displays, material reviews, and more. Importantly, the law prevents books from being abruptly pulled from shelves, requiring proper school material reconsideration. The law also states that reconsideration requests can only be submitted by parents and guardians of students in a given school district. 
This is a positive step, but it is not enough. 
Across the state, books continue to face challenges. Local communities must remain vigilant. At the same time, there is a national trend toward the normalization of censoring certain topics. Just four days after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a statement condemning “Biden’s Book Ban Hoax.” 
Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said, “By dismissing these complaints and eliminating the position and authorities of a so-called ‘book ban coordinator,’ the department is beginning the process of restoring the fundamental rights of parents to direct their children’s education.”
The argument in defense of book bans, invoking parents’ rights, is common. Certainly, parental rights are a rhetorically powerful political argument. Yet, it does not hold. Political expression is a fundamental protection in the United States, as is freedom of speech. That right is for all, not some. Parental rights do not mean a parent of one child has the right to dictate what the child of another parent reads in their local public library. 
The issue of book banning has become of dire importance. Book bans privilege distinct ideological views while censoring and demonizing gender identity, sexual orientation, and the stories of marginalized groups. 
It is critical, now more than ever, that communities in Connecticut continue to protect diverse perspectives in their public libraries and schools. There are many ways to fight against book banning, and action is crucial at the local level. Vote in your local elections. Attend local school board meetings and local town halls. Report book bans to organizations like PEN America, the American Library Association, or the National Coalition Against Censorship. Most importantly, read banned books. Without these books, stories are lost.

Recent weeks have brought good news about vaccines, with studies indicating that flu vaccination reduces heart disease, shingles vaccines can prevent or slow dementia, and a single human papillomavirus shot protects a girl from cervical cancer for the rest of her life.
But in the upside-down world of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., vaccines are on the ropes. A vaccine committee dominated by skeptics he chose for the panel voted 8-to-3 Friday to end a 34-year recommendation to inoculate newborns against hepatitis B, a practice that helped reduce childhood infections of the virus by 99%, from around 16,000 in 1991 to only seven in 2023.
While the committee went about its deliberations, the peril of abandoning vaccines was plain to see. The country’s worst year since 1992 for measles — an entirely vaccine-preventable illness — continued with flare-ups in Utah, Arizona, and South Carolina. A two-year outbreak of whooping cough, which vaccines can also check, has caused about 60,000 reported cases — including at least six infant deaths.
But neither of those diseases was discussed on the first day of the meeting by members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The panel’s chartered purpose is to determine vaccination policies to counter such risks, but under Kennedy, it has focused on responding to doubts from vaccine skeptics and opponents.
Like previous gatherings of the committee, which was handpicked by Kennedy after he fired the panel’s 17 incumbent experts in June, the session was chaotically at odds with past practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kennedy has described the agency as a “cesspool of corruption.”
The committee’s chair, epidemiologist Martin Kulldorff, left three days before the meeting and was named to a senior HHS position. His successor, Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who has claimed that the mRNA technology used to make covid vaccines is “the biggest threat to humanity,” was on a plane or in Asia for most of the meeting, leaving Vice Chair Robert Malone holding the reins. Malone opposes vaccine mandates and became a darling of the anti-vaccine movement when he told podcast host Joe Rogan in 2021 that Americans were “basically being hypnotized” into taking the covid vaccine.
Typically, slides and data for the panel’s meetings are posted on the CDC’s website several days beforehand. This time they weren’t posted at all.
The committee’s working group that studied hepatitis B vaccines did not include recognized hepatitis experts. When a few panel members expressed reservations during the ACIP meeting, CDC hepatitis specialist Adam Langer was brought in to answer questions. He frowned on the proposed changes.
Surprising choice of experts
At 8 a.m. Dec. 4, the CDC finally listed the names of the meeting’s presenters. Aaron Siri, one of Kennedy’s former lawyers and a strident legal foe of vaccination, was set to headline Friday’s discussion of the pediatric immunization schedule.
Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and physician who cast a deciding vote for Kennedy to win confirmation to his job, said on the social platform X: “Aaron Siri is a trial attorney who makes his living suing vaccine manufacturers. He is presenting as if an expert on childhood vaccines. The ACIP is totally discredited. They are not protecting children.”
In replies to his post, some people demanded to know what Cassidy planned to do about it. While he has publicly criticized some of Kennedy’s moves on vaccines, the senator has made no visible effort to reverse them.
As the meeting began, Malone revealed that Vicky Pebsworth, a senior officer at the National Vaccine Information Center, a four-decade-old cornerstone of vaccine skepticism, was chairing a committee that is reviewing the entire childhood vaccine schedule. That’s the repository of ACIP recommendations that protect American children from measles, pertussis, influenza, tetanus, chickenpox, meningitis, and a host of other diseases.
Typically, seasoned CDC and FDA experts on vaccines and infectious disease present data about a disease and the options for its prevention before ACIP votes on a policy. Instead, Pebsworth, vaccine-skeptical climate scientist Cynthia Nevison, and businessperson Mark Blaxill, who helped lead another anti-vaccine group, presented the case — a negative one — on the hepatitis B vaccine on Dec. 4.
Sports medicine doctor Tracy Beth Høeg, who parlayed a year working with University of California-San Francisco epidemiologist Vinay Prasad, now the FDA’s vaccine chief, into a leading role at the agency, frequently chimed in. Nevison and Blaxill were co-authors of a 2021 autism study retracted for data misrepresentation and other problems.
Unsurprisingly, the picture they painted Dec. 4 suggested that the hepatitis B birth dose wasn’t necessary, and might be dangerous, notwithstanding years of scientific consensus to the contrary.
The presentations stunned Cody Meissner, an infectious disease specialist and one of the only vaccinologists on the CDC panel. “There were so many statements that I don’t agree with that it’s hard to be succinct,” he said.
Yvonne Maldonado, a Stanford University infectious disease specialist and one of the former ACIP members ejected in June, said she found it horrifying to watch unvetted presentations by nonexpert nonphysicians.
“Almost every statement made by this committee was misinformation, disinformation, or outright lies,” she said. “They are cherry-picking data, pulling up fringe papers, misunderstanding good papers. They are not the right people to be making decisions.”
Pebsworth said the committee was taking up the birth dose issue because of “pressure coming from stakeholder groups” — presumably including Kennedy and his allies. The U.S. is an “outlier” in its universal recommendation, she erroneously said.
In fact, the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is given in 115 countries and is recommended by the World Health Organization. Many Western European countries limit the birth dose to targeted groups, however.
Arguments for the birth dose
Nevison said targeted measures to stop the virus in the 1980s, including promoting safer sex, increasing blood screening, and vaccinating the babies of hepatitis B-positive mothers, had achieved most of the reduction in cases since then. But most experts say the birth dose played a key role. And the virus remains a threat, with an estimated 640,000 carriers in the U.S.
The birth dose “is a safety net,” Meissner said. “It’s really for chronically infected mothers who for one reason or another do not get tested.”
“Where is the evidence of harm?” asked another panelist, psychiatrist Joseph Hibbeln.
In the years since the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine was recommended, it has caused vanishingly few confirmed major side effects.
Blaxill, who 25 years ago helped advance the since-disproven theory that traces of mercury in vaccines were causing an epidemic of autism, said that hepatitis B vaccines were inadequately studied. He pointed to a study that showed high fevers in some children after the shot, which he said suggested brain inflammation.
Maldonado said that’s wrong. “I’ve seen thousands of children with fevers,” she said. “It’s not the same as encephalitis.”
Nevison said that a small number of vaccine court awards proved at least some harm by hepatitis B vaccinations. Reed Grimes, director of the Division of Injury Compensation Programs at the Health Resources and Services Administration, explained that an award does not necessarily signify proof of injury, but rather that the government decided not to contest a claim.
Speculation bloomed. Panelist Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician, posited that rising cases of inflammatory bowel disease might be related to a medium — brewer’s yeast — used in the production of the hepatitis B vaccine. She did not cite a source for the idea.
Babies born with hepatitis B infections have a 90% chance of chronic liver infection later in life, and 25% of those with a chronic infection will die prematurely with chronic liver disease.
Panel members pushing to end the universal birth dose argued that blood tests of pregnant women should show who needs the shot. But only 35% of women who test positive receive all recommended follow-up care, and the virus can spread easily through contacts as common as a toothbrush or a bath towel. Ending the birth dose could result in nearly 500 deaths a year, according to a recent study.
The meeting was preceded by a heavy round of briefings for journalists and “prebunking” papers from established medical experts who view the new ACIP as a sounding board for anti-vaccine views — “inflating speculative risks while downplaying well-established vaccine benefits,” as three recent CDC officials wrote.
They noted that the hepatitis B birth dose is already optional, although doctors strongly recommend it. But recommending that it be a shared decision based on individual choice, as the ACIP voted Dec. 5, could add paperwork for doctors and introduce doubts in parents’ minds.
ACIP recommendations aren’t binding but have been used by health insurers in the past to establish coverage decisions. Federal agencies and private insurers will in most cases continue to pay for the hepatitis B vaccination if parents want it, said Andrew Johnson, who represented the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services during the meeting. But studies have shown that ambiguous advice leads to lower vaccination rates, said Kathryn Edwards, a Vanderbilt University vaccinologist.
Anti-vaccine activists have long targeted the hepatitis B birth dose. At one time they baselessly claimed it caused sudden infant death syndrome.
But within a decade of the universal dose implementation, the rate of SIDS had fallen by nearly half. That was thanks to an HHS-American Academy of Pediatrics’ “back to sleep” campaign, which urged parents to avoid suffocation risk by not letting their babies go to sleep on their stomachs.

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The next speaker of the House of Delegates will likely be a woman and immigrant.
Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) appears to have a clear path within the Democratic Caucus to become the next speaker. A vote is scheduled for Dec. 16.
Three of the four leading candidates to succeed former Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) have bowed out — Appropriations Committee Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), Economic Matters Committee Chair C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) and Legislative Black Caucus Chair Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery) — effectively clearing the field for Peña-Melnyk, Maryland Matters has learned.
“I am really honored and very moved that Chairman Barnes … Black Caucus Chair Wilkins and the chair of the Economic Matters Committee … C.T. Wilson, have decided to support my candidacy for speaker,” Peña-Melnyk said in a brief phone interview Sunday night.
“They have decided to withdraw their candidacy to allow me to move ahead. The vote is scheduled for the 16th [of December], and at that time, I will have the opportunity to make my case to the entire caucus,” she said. “As you know, there’s 102 members, and I hope to make my case and to be able to get their support. I’m very humbled and moved, and we’ll see what happens on the 16th.”
While it’s not official until the Dec. 16 vote, Barnes left little doubt Sunday about who the next speaker would be.
Jones steps down, ending historic era as House Speaker

“I’m 100% in support of our new speaker, Joseline Peña-Melnyk. She has the toughness, intelligence and grit to be a great speaker. I know she will be,” Barnes said. “I’m going to support her any way I can.”
Barnes, who represents the same district as Peña-Melnyk, said they came to the legislature together 20 years ago and he called her “a great friend” and “like a big sister to me. I can’t wait to get to work with her.”
Wilkins, in a phone call late Sunday, confirmed that she has withdrawn her candidacy and is supporting Peña-Melnyk.
Peña-Melnyk would become the second woman to lead a chamber of the Maryland General Assembly. She would also be the first person born in the Dominican Republic to lead either the House or Senate.
Her ascendance to the rostrum makes her the highest-ranking Afro-Latino in the history of the General Assembly.
Peña-Melnyk assumes the top House spot in the last year of a four-year term. She’ll immediately face a $1.5 billion budget deficit as well as a caucus anxious to pass midcycle congressional redistricting, despite opposition in the Senate.
She will have to guide the House as it considers overrides of vetoes issued by Gov. Wes Moore (D), including a bill on the creation of a reparations commission. Peña-Melnyk defended that bill on the floor of the House last year.
She also takes over amid growing worries among immigrants in Maryland and heightened enforcement by federal agents who are prosecuting President Donald Trump’s pledge to carry out mass arrests and deportations.
Peña-Melnyk succeeds Jones, who last week announced she would give up the position she was first elected to in 2019. Jones said she would remain in the House.
She did not give a reason for her decision. She also did not attend the meeting Thursday where her top lieutenants, the chairs of the House standing committees, were informed of her decision.
Jones’ announcement last week touched off a flurry of activity. A number of candidates expressed interest in the slot, with Barnes, Wilson and Peña-Melnyk considered the frontrunners.
Peña-Melnyk has been a member of the House since 2007. She became chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee in 2022. Prior to that she served three years as the panel’s vice chair.
Peña-Melnyk, 59, was born in the Dominican Republic. She immigrated to the U.S. as a small child and grew up in New York, graduating from high school in the Bronx.
She earned her law degree from the University at Buffalo School of Law, State University of New York. She later worked as both a federal prosecutor and a public defender. She also worked as a child neglect lawyer.
She is the mother of three, including twins.
Her political career includes three years on the College Park City Council. She was elected to the House of Delegates in 2006.
During her time in the House she’s built a reputation as a major player on health care policy issues. During her time as vice chair of HGO she took on greater responsibility for running committee hearings and defending bills in recent years.
In 2016, she ran unsuccessfully for the 4th District congressional seat. She placed third, receiving 19% of the vote in the Democratic primary.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230322TorresPenaMelnyk01-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-07 22:56:24.381164

StebbinsMichelle Lynn Kahn, University of Richmond

How can society police the global spread of online far-right extremism while still protecting free speech? That’s a question policymakers and watchdog organizations confronted as early as the 1980s and ’90s – and it hasn’t gone away.
Decades before artificial intelligence, Telegram and white nationalist Nick Fuentes’ livestreams, far-right extremists embraced the early days of home computing and the internet. These new technologies offered them a bastion of free speech and a global platform. They could share propaganda, spew hatred, incite violence and gain international followers like never before.
Before the digital era, far-right extremists radicalized each other primarily using print propaganda. They wrote their own newsletters and reprinted far-right tracts such as Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” and American neo-Nazi William Pierce’s “The Turner Diaries,” a dystopian work of fiction describing a race war. Then, they mailed this propaganda to supporters at home and abroad.
I’m a historian who studies neo-Nazis and far-right extremism. As my research shows, most of the neo-Nazi propaganda confiscated in Germany from the 1970s through the 1990s came from the United States. American neo-Nazis exploited their free speech under the First Amendment to bypass German censorship laws. German neo-Nazis then picked up this print propaganda and distributed it throughout the country.
This strategy wasn’t foolproof, however. Print propaganda could get lost in the mail or be confiscated, especially when crossing into Germany. Producing and shipping it was also expensive and time-consuming, and far-right organizations were chronically understaffed and strapped for cash.
 Going digital

Computers, which entered the mass market in 1977, promised to help resolve these problems. In 1981, Matt Koehl, head of the National Socialist White People’s Party in the United States, solicited donations to “Help the Party Enter The Computer Age.” The American neo-Nazi Harold Covington begged for a printer, scanner and “serious PC” that could run WordPerfect word processing software. “Our multifarious enemies already possess this technology,” he noted, referring to Jews and government officials.
Soon, far-right extremists figured out how to connect their computers to one another. They did so by using online bulletin board systems, or BBSes, a precursor to the internet. A BBS was hosted on a personal computer, and other computers could dial in to the BBS using a modem and a terminal software program, allowing users to exchange messages, documents and software.
With BBSes, anyone interested in accessing far-right propaganda could simply turn on their computer and dial in to an organization’s advertised phone number. Once connected, they could read the organization’s public posts, exchange messages and upload and download files.
The first far-right bulletin board system, the Aryan Nations Liberty Net, was established in 1984 by Louis Beam, a high-ranking member of the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nations. Beam explained: “Imagine, if you can, a single computer to which all leaders and strategists of the patriotic movement are connected. Imagine further that any patriot in the country is able to tap into this computer at will in order to reap the benefit of all accumulative knowledge and wisdom of the leaders. ‘Someday,’ you may say? How about today?”
Then came violent neo-Nazi computer games. Neo-Nazis in the United States and elsewhere could upload and download these games via bulletin board systems, copy them onto disks and distribute them widely, especially to schoolchildren.
In the German computer game KZ Manager, players role-played as a commandant in a Nazi concentration camp that murdered Jews, Sinti and Roma, and Turkish immigrants. An early 1990s poll revealed that 39% of Austrian high schoolers knew of such games and 22% had seen them.
 Arrival of the web

By the mid-1990s, with the introduction of the more user-friendly World Wide Web, bulletin boards fell out of favor. The first major racial hate website on the internet, Stormfront, was founded in 1995 by the American white supremacist Don Black. The civil rights organization Southern Poverty Law Center found that almost 100 murders were linked to Stormfront.
By 2000, the German government had discovered, and banned, over 300 German websites with right-wing content – a tenfold increase within just four years.
In response, American white supremacists again exploited their free speech rights to bypass German censorship bans. They gave international far-right extremists the opportunity to host their websites safely and anonymously on unregulated American servers – a strategy that continues today.
 Up next: AI

The next frontier for far-right extremists is AI. They are using AI tools to create targeted propaganda, manipulate images, audio and videos, and evade detection. The far-right social network Gab created a Hitler chatbot that users can talk to.
AI chatbots are also adopting the far-right views of social media users. Grok, the chatbot on Elon Musk’s X, recently called itself “MechaHitler,” spewed antisemitic hate speech and denied the Holocaust.
 Countering extremism

Combating online hate is a global imperative. It requires comprehensive international cooperation among governments, nongovernmental organizations, watchdog organizations, communities and tech corporations.
Far-right extremists have long pioneered innovative ways to exploit technological progress and free speech. Efforts to counter this radicalization are challenged to stay one step ahead of the far right’s technological advances.

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 5, 2025, agreed to review the long-simmering controversy over birthright citizenship. It will likely hand down a ruling next summer.
In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order removing the recognition of citizenship for the U.S.-born children of both immigrants here illegally and visitors here only temporarily. The new rule is not retroactive. This change in long-standing U.S. policy sparked a wave of litigation culminating in Trump v. Washington, an appeal by Trump to remove the injunction put in place by federal courts.
When the justices weigh the arguments, they will focus on the meaning of the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, known as the citizenship clause: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Both sides agree that to be granted birthright citizenship under the Constitution, a child must be born inside U.S. borders and the parents must be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. However, each side will give a very different interpretation of what the second requirement means. Who falls under “the jurisdiction” of the United States in this context?
As a close observer of the court, I anticipate a divided outcome grounded in strong arguments from each side.
Arguments for automatic citizenship
Simply put, the argument against the Trump administration is that the 14th Amendment’s expansion of citizenship after the eradication of slavery was meant to be broad rather than narrow, encompassing not only formerly enslaved Black people but all persons who arrived on U.S. soil under the protection of the Constitution.
The Civil War amendments – the 13th, 14th and 15th – established inherent equality as a constitutional value, which embraced all persons born in the nation without reference to race, ethnicity or origin.
One of the strongest arguments that automatic citizenship is the meaning of the Constitution is long-standing practice. Citizenship by birth regardless of parental status – with few exceptions – has been the effective rule since the time of America’s founding.
Advocates also point to precedent: the landmark case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898. When an American-born descendant of resident noncitizens sued after being refused re-entry to San Francisco under the Chinese Exclusion Act, the court recognized his natural-born citizenship.
If we read the Constitution in a living fashion – emphasizing the evolution of American beliefs and values over time – the constitutional commitment to broad citizenship grounded in equality, regardless of ethnicity or economic status, seems even more clear.
However, advocates must try to convince the court’s originalists – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who read the Constitution based on its meaning when it was adopted.
The originalist argument in favor of birthright citizenship is that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to invoke only a small set of exceptions found in traditional British common law. In the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the court relied on this “customary law of England, brought to America by the colonists.”
One exception to birthright citizenship covered by this line of rulings is the child of a foreign diplomat, whose parents represent the interests of another country. Another exception is the children of invading foreign armies. A third exception discussed explicitly by the framers of the 14th Amendment was Native Americans, who at the time were understood to be under the jurisdiction of their tribal government as a separate sovereign. That category of exclusion faded away after Congress recognized the citizenship of Native Americans in 1924.
The advocates of automatic birthright citizenship conclude that whether the 14th Amendment is interpreted in a living or in an original way, its small set of exceptions do not override its broad message of citizenship grounded in human equality.
Opposition to birthright citizenship
The opposing argument begins with a simple intuition: In a society defined by self-government, as America is, there is no such thing as citizenship without consent. In the same way that an American citizen cannot declare himself a French citizen and vote in French elections without consent from the French government, a foreign national cannot declare himself a U.S. citizen without consent.
This argument emphasizes that citizenship in a democracy means holding equal political power over our collective decisions. That is something only existing citizens hold the right to offer to others, something which must be decided through elections and the lawmaking process.
The court’s ruling in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884 – just 16 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment – endorses “the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent.” By making entry into the United States without approval a federal offense, Congress has effectively denied that consent.
Scholars who support this view argue that the 14th Amendment does not provide this consent. Instead it sets a limitation. To the authors of the 14th Amendment, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” conveyed a limit to natural citizenship grounded in mutual allegiance. That means if people are free to deny their old national allegiance, and an independent nation is free to decide its own membership, the recognition of a new national identity must be mutual.
Immigrants living in the United States illegally have not accepted the sovereignty of the nation’s laws. On the other side of the coin, the government has not officially accepted them as residents under its protection.
President Donald Trump speaks on recent Supreme Court rulings in the briefing room at the White House on June 27, 2025. The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that individual judges cannot grant nationwide injunctions to block executive orders, including the injunction on Trump’s effort to eliminate birthright citizenship in the U.S. The justices did not rule on Trump’s order to end birthright citizenship but stopped his order from taking effect for 30 days.

If mutual recognition of allegiance is the meaning of the 14th Amendment, the Trump administration has not violated it.
The opponents of birthright citizenship argue that the Wong Kim Ark ruling has been misrepresented. In that case, the court only considered permanent legal residents like Wong Kim Ark’s parents, but not residents here illegally or temporarily. The focus on British common law in that ruling is simply misguided because the findings of Calvin’s Case or any other precedents dealing with British subjects were voided by the American Revolution.
In this view, the Declaration of Independence replaced subjects with citizens. The power to determine national membership was taken away from kings and placed in the hands of democratic majorities.
For opponents of birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment does not take that power away from citizens but instead codifies the rule that mutual consent is the touchstone of admission. The requirement to be “subject to the jurisdiction” provides the mechanism of that consent.
Congress can determine who is accepted as a member of the national community under its jurisdiction. In this view, Congress – and the American people – have spoken: Current federal laws make entry into U.S. borders without permission a crime rather than a forced acceptance of political membership.
What might happen
The court will likely announce a ruling in summer 2026 before early July, just in time for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The court will ultimately decide whether the Constitution endorses the declaration’s invocation of essential equality or its creation of a sovereign people empowered to determine the boundaries of national membership.
The court’s three Democratic-appointed justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – will surely side against the Trump administration. The six Republican-appointed justices seem likely to divide, a symptom of disagreements within the originalist camp.
The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship. This will likely be some combination of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
The Trump administration will prevail only if five out of the six conservatives reject the British common law foundations of the Wong Kim Ark ruling in favor of citizenship by consent alone.
America should know by July Fourth.

(Getty Images)Nothing in Gov. Joe Lombardo’s proclamation calling a legislative special session last month gave “special” attention to the economic pressures and aggravations Nevadans are trying to deal with right now.
Uninspired leadership, perhaps. But it also reflects a default presumption that whatever financial pains are being suffered in Nevada households, there isn’t really much Nevada state government can do about it.
What Lombardo fondly calls the “Nevada way” is laced with surrenderism.
For starters…
In an October poll, Nevada respondents blamed the Las Vegas tourism slump on the destination being too expensive.
That’s a convenient poll result for the Republican governor and many Democrats seeking election to statewide office. If the economy is the industry’s fault, then it’s up to the industry, not state elected officials, to fix it, so neener neener, they’re off the hook.
The industry’s not going to fix the Las Vegas economy for the same reason it’s — at least in part — responsible for breaking it: The Las Vegas casino-hotel industry’s commitment to customers pales in comparison to its commitment to shareholders.
But it’s mistaken to assume dire area economic conditions are unique to Las Vegas or the tourism industry. The marketplace is becoming more aggravating, infuriating, and expensive in nearly every economic sector, not just in Nevada but nationwide.
Nevada’s prosperity and lack thereof is infamous for its dependence on the national economy. That’s another convenience for state-level elected officials. They’re not in charge of the national economy. And Nevada’s state government is deliberately built to to prevent passage of economic policy unless it’s focused on providing assistance to business. So nobody expects state elected officials to do much if anything about daily financial pressures crushing their constituents.
There are of course a lot of state-level policy initiatives and reforms that would improve the financial wherewithal of working households in Nevada: lower the state’s high insurance tax and sales tax rates; provide working families with state-level tax rebates and child tax credits; fund public transit to liberate people from the cost of cars (one of the highest households expenses behind housing); fund child care (one of the other highest household expenses); pay for all those things and other long-neglected Nevada services and programs A) with a billionaire tax, and B) by raising taxes on a gambling industry that currently spends more on stock buybacks to enrich shareholders the world over than it pays in state gaming taxes; cap rent increases (to be fair, state legislative Democrats have taken modest swings at that); enact laws assuring paid leave; raise the pathetically low minimum wage.
Those are just for starters.
It could get worse before it gets better
The most recently reported inflation rate was the same as it was when Trump was inaugurated, 3%, according to the September consumer price index report. (Due to the government shutdown, no CPI report was released for October; the November inflation report is scheduled to be released Dec. 18.)
As painful as continuously rising prices are, Trump’s policies stoked fears that inflation would be even worse than it has been, especially after he launched his global war on trade in April.
Worse could still be in the cards.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics released a paper more than a year ago, before Trump was elected, which attempted to model economic impacts of tariffs, deportation of immigrants, and revoking the Federal Reserve Board’s independence.
Under the models, inflation and unemployment were projected to begin rising significantly — but not until at least about a year after Trump’s policies went into effect.
“None of us expected it to be immediate,” the Peterson Institute’s president, Adam Posen, told a Financial Times podcast this week.
If you were among business executives reacting to tariffs, you “had to make very difficult decisions about your supply chains,” Posen said. “Even if you’re Toyota or Caterpillar or somebody incredibly sophisticated like that, it’s still difficult to decide ‘okay, given the tariffs, what stuff do we bring home, what stuff do we put in Mexico versus China, where are our alternative suppliers, who do we use, what do we invest in the U.S.?’ And if that’s true for these companies, just imagine what it’s like … for all the middle-sized companies.”
“So there were a lot of good reasons to think that the tariffs are going to take a while to take effect,” Posen said.
Though acknowledging his is not a consensus view, Posen said he expects “inflation is going to be significantly higher than the current forecasts by a year from now, probably by the third quarter of 2026.”
The Peterson Institute is considered one of the world’s better think tanks, and especially among those with an economics focus.
That doesn’t mean Posen’s right.
And by his own admission his view isn’t aligned with other mainstream forecasts, which see the inflation rate (but not prices) beginning to decline next year.
But Posen’s forecast appears to be somewhat in sync with the wisdom of crowds. Though improving slightly this month, consumer sentiment remains dramatically down from what it was a year ago, and consumers expect inflation to go higher than it is now, both short-term and long-term.
Direct, indirect, and maybe some day
Those who place an outsized faith in the goodness of market forces — a club to which most Nevada politicians of both parties belong — assume inflation will eventually stop freaking everybody out and the economy will become more hospitable, eventually. Everybody just has to soldier on and wait it out.
In another convenient turn for Nevada politicians, that assumption dovetails with the conventionally held (if rarely publicly articulated) view that Nevada is powerless to do anything of much consequence to improve the day-to-day economic wherewithal of its residents.
Next year is a campaign year. Polling in Nevada, as nationwide, consistently finds the economy is far and away the top concern of voters.
Voters should keep an eye out to see which Nevada candidates outline specific proposals designed to address the financial stability of Nevada households directly, and which candidates trot out the fundamental premise of the “Nevada way,” i.e., help powerful industries and wait patiently for prosperity to ripple out to everyone else.
And voters should also watch to see which candidates, when asked about economic pressures facing households, claim impotence, recite a platitude, and change the subject.

There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.
It’s becoming more common for South Dakotans to kill themselves with a gun, according to new data. 
The number of South Dakotans who took their own lives with a firearm rose to 116 last year, and the proportion of South Dakota suicides involving a gun rose to 59%, according to the state Department of Health. The state’s gun-suicide rate rose to 12.6 per 100,000 people. All three numbers are the highest in recent years’ data for the state.
Suicide prevention workers say the numbers underscore the need for real-life connection and safe gun storage in a state where firearm ownership is common and legal gun restrictions are minimal.
Sioux Falls Police Chief John Thum cautioned against attributing the trends to a single cause, because local investigations encounter factors ranging from terminal illness to relationship struggles, chronic depression and substance use. 
But access and lethality also matter.
“There’s a definite sense of finality to a gunshot attempt,” Thum said. “If we look at some of the other suicide attempts that we have — overdose, and some of the other ones — the level of absolutism to a firearm is there.” 
Gun laws and lawmaking in Pierre
According to estimates by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit policy think tank, more than half of adults in South Dakota live in a household with a firearm. A separate analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, shows South Dakota has some of the loosest gun restrictions in the country, and “more than twice as many suicides by firearm occur in states with the fewest gun laws, relative to states with the most laws.”
South Dakota requires no permit or background check for private gun sales, allows for the carrying of concealed pistols without a permit, allows concealed pistols in bars and on public college campuses, allows concealed pistols in the state Capitol with prior approval and notification, does not have a firearm registration system, and lacks a “red flag law,” which in other states allows temporary firearm removals from people in crisis.
Democratic former state lawmaker Linda Duba, of Sioux Falls, unsuccessfully proposed what she described as two “modest firearm safety bills” during the 2024 legislative session. She said one of her goals was to lower firearm suicides in the state.
One bill would have required gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms. The other would have required firearms not in use to be locked away with a gun lock or in a safe. Duba said she had seen research that locked-up firearms were less likely to be used in a suicide. 
Duba said some Republican legislators privately supported the measures, but refused to back them publicly because they feared political retaliation from the National Rifle Association. She said the association makes it impossible to convince Republican legislators to support “even the most reasonable regulations.”
“It’s going to take someone being personally impacted before they wake up,” Duba said.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, is a retired sheriff, former state Department of Corrections secretary and a member of the National Guard. He was one of a handful of Republican lawmakers earlier this year to vote against the legislation that now allows for the carrying of concealed pistols on technical college and public university campuses. He said many Republicans in Pierre fear negative campaign postcards from the National Rifle Association showing up in their constituents’ mailboxes.
“Nobody wants a ‘D,’ ‘C,’ or even a ‘B’ grade,” from the NRA, Reisch said. “These scorecards are ridiculous. It’s one person’s opinion. But in the end, come election season, sound bites matter. It’s ‘Reisch is soft on crime.’ And those things weigh heavily in the minds of some legislators who really want to keep getting elected.”  
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

Former state trooper Rep. Jim Halverson, R-Winner, also voted against the bill allowing concealed pistols on campus.
“I’m a Second Amendment lover, I really am,” he said. “I just believe there are places where it’s not a good idea.”
Halverson said college is a place where students may experience their first big failure, first major breakup, and first experiences with drugs and alcohol. All of that, and being away from the support of family at home, makes for an environment where suicides could become more likely, he said. 
Halverson said “unless these people have seen somebody who’s been shot themselves, seen someone who has taken their life, they don’t get it.”
“They haven’t had to go pick up a body,” he said. “Or go to somebody’s house and say, ‘Your son or daughter is not coming home tonight.’”
Retired law enforcement officer Rep. Kevin Van Diepen, R-Huron, voted in favor of the pistols-on-campus bill. He said it was a Second Amendment issue, and it would have been unconstitutional to restrict students’ rights. 
Van Diepen said suicide “is a mental health issue.” 
“If they didn’t have a gun, they would use some other means,” he said. 
Storage, loneliness and stigma
Lost & Found is a Sioux Falls-based suicide prevention nonprofit. Researcher Cody Ingle said suicide is not always linked to mental illness. Sometimes it’s an impulsive decision brought on by stress or crisis. He said things like gun locks can be the difference between people pulling the trigger in the heat of the moment, and just a few more breaths that can save their life. 
“We’ve had individuals come up to us and say, ‘This gun lock saved my life,’” Ingle said. “We’re not saying guns are bad, but creating time and space between someone in a difficult headspace and a firearm can save lives.”
Safe gun storage, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, includes locking up guns in a safe with a trigger lock and keeping ammunition separately stored. Keys and codes should be secured.










They haven’t had to go pick up a body. Or go to somebody’s house and say, ‘Your son or daughter is not coming home tonight.’


– Rep. Jim Halverson, R-Winner


Loneliness and isolation — which the U.S. surgeon general declared a public health crisis in 2023 — is also playing a role in the gun suicide trend, said Carrie Jorgensen, executive director of Lost & Found. 
“People are not connecting like they used to,” she said. “And in the online, virtual space, it’s not the same. You can still feel incredibly lonely, even if you have 10 conversations happening at the same time.” 
She said stigma around mental health remains strong in South Dakota, where cultural norms can discourage seeking help, particularly among men. 
“That idea of ‘pull yourself up by your bootstraps, just grin and bear it,’ continues to exist, especially within that population,” Jorgensen said. 
The male suicide death rate in the U.S. is about four times higher than the female rate, and 57% of male suicides in South Dakota from 2015 to 2024 involved a firearm, according to the state Department of Health. 
Jorgensen advised South Dakotans to take the time to maintain real-life friendships and a sense of community, and not to be too proud to ask for help from friends, family or suicide prevention and mental health professionals.

(Photo courtesy of Emma Yerkey)As farmers face historic headwinds and market hardships, calls to the national Farm Aid hotline and the Iowa Concern hotline — where farmers can get support in times of mental health crisis or need — are increasing.
This fall, the Iowa Concern hotline saw four to five times the number of calls it had in the same months last year, said Tammy Jacobs, the hotline’s manager.
The Farm Aid hotline is also seeing a change in the urgency of calls.
“We’re seeing more established farmers calling in — people who know how to play the game and how to access programs. They’re calling more often now, because even with all that institutional knowledge, they’re still running into issues for the first time that are more complex and difficult to solve,” said Lori Mercer, a Farm Aid hotline operator. “The system that’s in place is simply letting them down. There’s just no further safety net.” 
Research shows farmers die by suicide at least twice as often as people in the general population, so there’s urgency to address the uptick in need. 
“It’s a huge issue. I mean, we’ve known at least three families this year whose loved ones died by suicide,” said Emma Yerkey, who’s part of the Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a monthly meetup for ag producers around the Quad-Cities to talk about their struggles.
Farmers experience a lot of stressors and uncertainty that they can’t control — isolation, weather changes, and financial pressures — along with low access to mental health care in rural areas and stigma that may make them keep their pain to themselves. Market conditions made worse by a trade war and inflation are adding to the stress. Mental health professionals are thinking outside the box to get producers care. 
Understanding the stress
Yerkey’s family farms corn, soybeans, and hay in Geneseo, Illinois, on land they’ve owned since the Civil War. The farm is filled with memories, especially of her dad, Tim Yerkey.

She played baseball with him in their driveway, the family ate meals together in the home, and, one year, her father helped her raise a ribbon-winning calf. 
“That was a really good memory that I have with him,” Yerkey said.
But the farm could be stressful, too. Tim Yerkey worked the land with his family, but at times had to take outside jobs to make ends meet. In 2011, he’d been struggling for about a year when spring floods left fields underwater. He’d reached out to friends and visited the emergency room seeking help, only to be told there were no beds, Yerkey said. He died by suicide in June 2011. 
“I miss my dad, and I don’t want anybody else — or any other family — to go through that,” Yerkey said.
But many farming families experience similar pain. Between 2003 and 2017, more than 1600 farmers died by suicide, the majority older white men.  
Experts say factors that contribute to stress and higher suicide rates among farmers include isolation, easy access to guns, a cultural expectation of toughness, stigma around seeking mental health care, worries about who will take over the farm, and a lack of recognition for their hard work.
Financial losses and stress are also significant risks for depressive symptoms. And right now, times are tough for farmers. 
Producers have endured high inflation and growing input costs on farms since at least 2020. The spread of COVID and, more recently, policy decisions like President Donald Trump’s tariffs and increases in immigration enforcement have all increased operating costs. At the same time, prices for major commodities are low — lower than the cost to grow them. Corn prices are about $0.85 below the break even point and soybeans are about $2 below. 
This year, many states are expecting a record corn crop, but farmers aren’t celebrating.
“It’s very discouraging for farmers to think that they’ve done all the things right in their fields and have put innovations in place and made good decisions, but yet, even with strong yields, they’re gonna be facing a loss on what they’re producing,” said Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union.
In 2024, the U.S. exported about 42% of its soybeans, most of it to China. With China not buying in the midst of the trade war, some farmers who usually send their crop abroad have struggled to find new markets. The U.S. in November struck a new deal with China, potentially extending a lifeline to producers still scrambling to move their harvest, but it remains to be seen what China will actually buy.
Some programs that helped connect farmers to domestic markets, like the Local Food Purchase Assistance initiative, have also been cut by the USDA. 
“Since the beginning of the year, the farmers have just been thrown into a different level of uncertainty with policy things like losing access to some markets through tariffs, losing access to staff and programming with the government shutdown, and the funding freezes. A big one we’re hearing about is losing access to labor with the ICE raids, etcetera,” said Mercer, with Farm Aid. “I was just speaking to a farmer the other day who was basically watching his crops rot on the vines because his usual labor support was just too afraid to show up this year.” 
In addition to all of the financial stress, farmers say they feel the work can be thankless. 
“This work is incredibly hard, and nobody understands where their food comes from. Nobody knows that [farmers] work 20 hours a day so that they can have a strawberry,” said Anna Scheyett, a retired professor of social work who studied farmer stress and suicide at the University of Georgia.
Meeting farmers where they are
Despite the many struggles, some families are finding hope and community in turbulent times. To honor her dad, Yerkey joined the new Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a Quad-Cities nonprofit that provides mental health resources, education, and safe spaces.

Gray Matters hosts monthly Barn Talks, where participants can share what’s weighing on them, whether it’s stress, depression, anxiety, or other struggles, and receive support from others. The organizers hope to build a sense of community and normalize talking about mental health. 
“Feeling comfortable and safe to say that — ‘Hey, I am stressed out, or I am really hurting right now. Maybe I am depressed, maybe I have some anxiety,’ — whatever it might be,” said Heather Gritton, one of the group leaders.
Offering spaces where farmers can meet and take some of that load off their shoulders can help break down the stigma around getting help, said Sara Kohlbeck, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin. 
It’s key for those spaces to be easily accessible to farmers. 
“Bringing that support to the farmers — or to the rural communities — rather than expecting those folks to come and get those resources for themselves is really important,” Kohlbeck said. “Otherwise, you know, we’ve got folks that are kind of suffering in silence because they just don’t have the time. Sometimes there’s stigma, and there’s kind of that pride issue.” 
There are also practical barriers. Telehealth isn’t a viable option for many farmers, as cell and internet reception in rural areas are limited. Driving long distances to see a counselor can also be impractical, especially during the busy harvest season. 
Another approach to reaching farmers has been to train people who farmers trust and regularly interact with — such as suppliers, lenders, large animal veterinarians, and spouses — to recognize when someone may be dealing with mental health challenges and teach them how to support them and direct them to resources. 
For example, Scheyett has trained agricultural lenders to recognize warning signs of suicide ideation and taught them how to respond. She’s also trained extension agents to take a few minutes at the beginning of agricultural production meetings to talk about stress and offer resources, something she says can make a real difference for farmers.
In one study, Scheyett and her co-authors found that farmers who were present at meetings where about 10 minutes were dedicated to talking about stress management walked away with new ideas for managing stress and a higher level of commitment to doing it. 
Sometimes, offering practical and logistical solutions to big problems can be a part of mental health services, too. 
“If a farmer has not really looked and done a deep dive into their farm financial system, we have a program that’s called farm financial associates, and they’ll come out to the farm, do a big evaluation over the farming operation to see where the hard points are and is there a way to switch things around, diversify, in order to help offset some of the farming losses and costs,” Jacobs, with the Iowa Concern hotline, said.

Where to call
Farmers can reach out to the 988 Lifeline or 1-800-FARM-AID for help. Help is also available in Spanish.
The Iowa Concern hotline is available 24/7 via chat, email, call, or text at 800-447-1985.

For farmers facing grain storage challenges, Jacobs suggested partnering with other farmers as an alternative to traditional co-op arrangements.
Scheyett suggests everybody can help by thanking farmers the same way we do with the military.
“Every time I see a farmer, I say thank you — thank you for your service, because what you do keeps us healthy, fed, and clothed,” Scheyett said.
It’s all in the hopes of providing care and saving lives.
“Even if you can save one life, I mean, that’s so worth it,” Yerkey said. “I feel very passionate about it.”

As a volunteer for The Vermont Afghan Alliance, I have gotten to know many of the recent Afghan arrivals here in Burlington and Montpelier.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Barbara Benton: Do not judge an entire group of people based on the actions of one individual.","This commentary is by Barbara Benton. She is a licensed clinical mental health counselor in Burlington, as well as a volunteer for the Vermont Afghan Alliance and other local organizations. 
In light of the recent violence in Washington, D.C. and the heightened anti-immigrant sentiment being promoted at the highest levels of this country, I want to reflect to Vermonters some of my experiences with the Afghans I have come to know.
My association with Afghanistan started about 16 years ago when I hosted a 16-year-old Afghan teenager in my home for almost a full year. He had received a scholarship from the U.S. government to study for one academic year in the U.S.
Despite propaganda to the contrary, his family hoped and trusted that he would be treated well in the US. I came to know him as one of the kindest and most thoughtful human beings I have met, and also came to truly understand that he was this way because his family valued those qualities, no less than I and my family did.
How enlightening to me that my family and his shared these values, despite differences in culture, customs and religion. And no surprise to me at all that his family and mine wanted their kids to be safe and cared for. He was eventually able to return to the U.S. on a student visa.
Today he lives in another state and was so proud to become a U.S. citizen. I consider him to be a part of my family and know him to still be the kind and thoughtful person I met half his life ago.
As a volunteer for The Vermont Afghan Alliance, I have gotten to know many of the recent Afghan arrivals here in Burlington and Montpelier. What I see is that they also, while being a diverse group of human beings, care about others and are so appreciative of the opportunity to work and live, and become a part of the social fabric here in the US.
Personal connections with Americans who care about their well-being, even a smile from a stranger, help so much in the process of welcoming newcomers and helping them integrate into our community. 
So please do not be inclined to judge an entire group of people based on the actions of one apparently troubled individual. Remember that we can share values of kindness and inclusion across cultures and diverse lifestyles.
And, were they to be returned to Afghanistan, they would face persecution and death because of their loyalty to the U.S.
Please stand with the Vermont Afghan Alliance, with me and with our Afghan allies as we continue to welcome them as valued members of our community. Let Vermont set the right tone in this time when some would try to tear us apart from each other and from our own humanity.

For some legislative supporters of providing public funds to private schools, the conditions being demanded by those private schools are OK. At least that seems to be the message, based on recent hearings at the Mississippi Capitol in advance of the 2026 legislative session.
“I don’t want to force our Christian schools to teach secular curriculum,” Rep. Jansen Owen, a Pearl River County Republican and co-chair of a House school choice select committee, said after an October meeting with the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools. ”I don’t want the state’s involvement to infringe on that in any way.”
Sure, it is highly likely many Mississippi legislators would support spending public funds on the teaching of “Christian values” and even campaign on that expenditure in their next election.
But what if the school receiving public funds was teaching Muslim values or Hindu values or Wiccan values?
What if the school accepted students only if they would pledge allegiance to the Prophet Muhammad?

Would it be OK with Mississippi politicians if the school taught tolerance and respect for LGBTQ people? What if the school allowed boys and girls to compete against each other in sports?
Would they support public funds going to those private schools?
Mississippi has a law preventing public schools from teaching diversity, equity and inclusion. Private schools are free to teach a DEI curriculum because they are, duh, private. But what if the private school teaching DEI was receiving public funds through vouchers, tax credits or some other scheme?
Many politicians also do not like the teaching of what is known as critical race theory or in general terms instruction on the impact of race on what happened in the past and what is occurring now. What if a private school wanted to construct its curriculum around the teaching of critical race theory? Would that be OK with Mississippi politicians who support providing vouchers to private schools?
Surely it would be.
After all, Mississippi politicians are known for their open mindedness. Look up the phrase open mindedness in Webster’s, and there is a photo of the Mississippi Legislature.
But such is not the case in Florida.
According to an article on the website of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, many Florida school choice supporters are concerned that Muslim schools are receiving public funds.
The article quotes Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, the former president of the state Senate, explaining that schools “‘that indoctrinate Sharia law should not be a part of our taxpayer-funded school voucher program.’”
Many Mississippi school choice proponents argue that the private schools receiving public funds should not be required to face the same oversight and rules and regulations of public schools.
When state Auditor Shad White, whose job is to provide accountability of the spending of public funds, was asked back in March whether private schools receiving public funds should be subject to governmental oversight, he said, “They are held accountable by the parents who choose to send their kids there.” 
So, if the private schools receiving those public funds want to teach “Sharia law” or the virtues of LGBTQ rights and the parents do not object, is that OK with politicians like Auditor White, House Speaker Jason White and Gov. Tate Reeves who all support passing a school choice bill during the upcoming 2026 legislative session?
If so, they are indeed open minded. We just didn’t know.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15220206/State-Capitol-2.jpg,,,2025-12-07 07:56:15.927891

The remote and undeveloped area is mainly the domain of wildlife, logging trucks, hunters and snowmobilers.
Recently, however, increasing numbers of rock climbers have frequented a stunning band of chiseled granite towers set in the middle of the Kingdom Heritage Lands, at a cliff 30 minutes south of the Canadian border and on the northern edge of the Nulhegan basin.

“As soon as you reach the cliff, your jaw drops,” Mischa Tourin, executive director of the Climbing Resource Access Group of Vermont — or CRAG-VT — said last week. “It all is perfect 90-degree angles, like it was built by rock climbers with rock climbing in mind.”
Climbers first explored the cliff, known as Black Mountain (not to be mistaken for Black Mountain Natural Area in Dummerston), around 2005, but only visited it sporadically until it was added to the second edition of Vermont’s comprehensive outdoor climbing guidebook, “Vermont Rock,” in 2022.
Alongside the subsequent increase in use of the cliff, the nonprofit CRAG-VT has spent the past few years working with landowners and easement-holders to preserve access, including creating a climbing management plan and establishing rock climbing as an “acceptable form of recreation” on the Kingdom Heritage Lands.
As part of that effort, six weeks of trail work on the area’s rugged and steep approach trail have been completed over the last two years by NorthWoods Stewardship Center, with significant funding from the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
According to Tourin, outdoor rock climbing in Vermont was, for a long time, defined by the schist that runs along the spine of the Green Mountains — a unique rock covered with tiny impressions, used by rock climbers as “holds.” In contrast, Black Mountain is made up of strong granite covered in “perfect” parallel cracks of varying sizes, Tourin said, which geologically has more in common with the White Mountains of New Hampshire or world-class climbing areas like Yosemite.

Those cracks, Tourin said, are very conducive to “traditional” climbing, where participants jam their hands and feet into the crack to move upward and place expansion gear — attached to a rope — in the cracks to catch a fall or help facilitate a descent.
“I think I feel comfortable saying that (Black Mountain) is the best place in the Northeast for crack climbing, as far as the number of crack climbs in one cliff,” the longtime climber and guide said. About 70 different routes have been established at the area, most of them of moderate or advanced difficulty.
However, reaching “Vermont’s premiere crack climbing mecca” can be quite the trek.
Black Mountain is located about a three-hour drive from Burlington, on the edge of Averill (population 21) and Lewis (population 0). Following a GPS will likely lead to a dead end, and a high-clearance vehicle is recommended.
The cliff is even a sizable distance from the Northeast Kingdom towns of St. Johnsbury (one hour and 30 minutes) or Newport (one hour), since users generally drive all the way up to the Canadian border in Norton before traveling 6.2 miles south on a slow, rocky power-line access road to reach Black Mountain’s parking area.
“It’s definitely far away,” Tourin said. “The last few times I’ve been there, it certainly seems like more folks in Canada have noticed that it’s a pretty good climbing resource because it’s only a couple miles south of the border.”
Before CRAG-VT’s involvement, the ordeal to reach the base of the cliff didn’t stop at the parking area. Up until a couple of years ago, visitors had to try and locate the access trail, which was steep, prone to erosion, often muddy and lined with prickly plants that latched onto any nearby pants leg.
As of last month, however, trail workers have fully established a sustainable approach trail that includes a welcome kiosk, 38 stone steps, four wooden ladders and 160 feet of retaining wall, a recent CRAG-VT newsletter explained.

“Next phases will continue base-of-cliff stabilization, assess more complex gully issues, and explore parking improvements,” the newsletter read. “This work moves us closer to a fully sustainable Black Mountain for years to come.”
According to Tourin, CRAG-VT’s work lies not only in securing access to climbing and stewarding cliffs but also in building community. To that end, the group held weekend member meetups titled Kingdom Climbing Weekend this year and last, renting out cottages at Quimby Country resort in Averill.
“We started it off maybe as a one-time thing to celebrate the start of (CRAG-VT’s) corridor manager agreement,” said Tourin, adding that most of those 40 participants wanted to return the next year to what he described as a “magical little family camp” on a lake.
“It’s a pretty great event and a pretty cool way to bring, I think, a little bit of money into the local community there,” he said.
While the remoteness of Black Mountain can be a draw, Tourin said it’s hard to gauge the future of the climbing area due to its location.
“It’s an amazing cliff,” he said. “I don’t know if it will ever be super crowded, just because it’s so far tucked away in the corner of the state, but it’s definitely a resource worth traveling to.”

This story by Liberty Darr was fist published in the Other Paper on Dec. 4, 2025.
Raymond and Elsie Whitney take good care of the lawn outside of their South Burlington home. In the summer months, it is alive with a blossoming display of zinnias and in the winter months, steadily manicured until the first snowfall, but through it all, a giant 50-foot Colorado Blue Spruce has remained a key marker to the home built in 1986.
But now, just a stump remains of what was once that “magnificent specimen.”
The couple, after several years of being pleaded with, decided to donate their tree for display on Church Street in Burlington during the holiday season this year. But for the couple, the donation holds a much greater mission than just greeting Church Street goers with some holiday cheer.
“Elsie has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease,” Raymond said, looking at his wife sitting next to him in their kitchen. “It seemed like a good time, because we wanted to not only just light up Church Street, we wanted to shine a light on Alzheimer’s disease too.”
The Whitney’s built their house and moved into it on Halloween night in 1986. As Raymond recalls, they were one of the first few settlers in the area that is now a sprawling development with several neighboring homes.
Just a few days later that same year, Raymond made the trek up to South Hero to buy a sapling, which, in just under four decades, would grow into the giant that they came to love. At the time, though, it stood only about five feet tall, Raymond said, pointing to an old photo of their home with the tree out front.
“Every single thing on this property, I put on it, every blade of grass, every plant and I plant this place stuffed with flowers,” Raymond said.
And every year, for at least the past few, the couple has been greeted by the Church Street Marketplace crew, asking if they would be open to donating their tree for the lighting ceremony. But every year, Raymond would quip about the birds having paid their rent for the year.
And in a sense, that sentiment is true. For the years that have followed, the tree has been home to birds and squirrels, which have been quite the pest for the couple in recent years. And as the couple has grown older, maintenance has become more and more tiresome, particularly in ensuring that their roof is free of nests.
Plus, the neighbors don’t look too happily at a 79-year-old man high up on a ladder cleaning out his gutters, Raymond said, letting out a laugh.
Coupled with Elsie’s recent diagnosis, the Whitneys decided now was the time to finally say ‘yes’ once the yearly ask came in.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of people living with Alzheimer’s in 2020 was nearly seven million and that number is only set to double come 2060. With the help of the Alzheimer’s Association chapter in Vermont, the couple has launched a fundraiser with a goal of $1,500, where people can donate under Elsie’s name.
Just days before the tree would make its home on Burlington’s most iconic street, a crowd of roughly 40 people gathered outside the Whitney’s home to send it off with some cheers and, of course, a champagne toast.
“It was just a special thing to see everybody with family,” Raymond said. “All the neighbors were out here with their kids. And we toasted our tree and said, ‘See you on Church Street.’”
But the celebrations weren’t just one-sided. The tree also put on a show for the crowd, doing a pirouette dance as it was lifted into the air, a gesture that the Whitney’s took personally.
“It danced for us,” Raymond said, looking fondly at Elsie, who was looking, in the same way, back at him.

Alive
Astrid Longstreth, 16, West Bolton
The stars are reflected in the glimmer of the headlamps’ light on the snow,
and the air is frozen – it feels like the sensation of holding your hand under water so burning-hot that it begins to feel cold,
somehow.
Nothing could be more perfect than feeling air rush in and out of your lungs, feeling alive when all is still.
I am alive.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)I’ve been thinking a lot about what it really costs to stay alive in this country. Not in the spiritual sense – in the literal one. The bills. The trade-offs. The quiet math families do when pain meets the price tag.
When I was 20, I broke my ankle. I had insurance. I did everything I was supposed to. Still, I’m paying for it – literally – years later. The surgery cost nearly $50,000. Even with insurance, I owed more than $10,000 out of pocket – payments that stretched on long after my leg healed.
More recently, I hurt my wrist chopping firewood to heat our home. My first thought wasn’t “how bad is it?” it was “can I afford to get this looked at?”
That’s the part people outside this reality don’t understand. It’s not the injury that breaks you, it’s the hesitation. The pause before asking for help because you already know the answer: it depends on your deductible.
Across the Shenandoah Valley where I live, people make this same calculation. Can I afford to get better?
We don’t talk about it much, but the numbers tell the story plain: about four in 10 adults in America carry medical or dental debt, and rural folks are more likely to struggle with it than people living in urban areas. Research shows medical problems and bills are among the leading contributors to personal bankruptcy. And for about seven in 10 adults with health care debt, the bills came from a one-time or short-term medical expense – a single hospital visit, an ER trip, or an unexpected procedure. One broken bone. One bad diagnosis. One stroke of bad luck, and your whole future can tip.
You learn to live smaller after that, to stretch prescriptions, to work through pain, to keep quiet about what hurts. To walk around with the silent fear that your body might betray your budget.
We’ve all become experts at pretending the system is normal, because it’s the only one we’ve ever known. But it’s not normal, it’s a choice.
Other nations – Norway, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, just to name a few – have made different choices about how to care for their people. None of them are perfect, and they’re not all the same. But they’ve each decided on one simple idea: getting sick shouldn’t mean going broke.
These countries pay for it in different ways, some through higher taxes, some through shared insurance systems, but the result is the same: people don’t have to hesitate before calling a doctor when something’s wrong. It’s not socialism. It’s just a society deciding that health care is part of the common good – like roads, schools, or clean water.
When I spoke recently with journalists from Norway and Sweden, they told me what care looks like where they live.
In Norway, a hospital stay doesn’t come with a payment plan. Education is free, prescriptions are affordable, and families don’t go bankrupt because a child gets sick.
People still work hard – farmers, factory workers, teachers – but they do it knowing one injury or illness won’t destroy everything they’ve built.
They pay more in taxes, but what they get in return is peace of mind. They don’t hesitate before calling the doctor. They don’t lie awake wondering if this month’s paycheck will cover both medicine and the electric bill.
It’s not a perfect system, none are, but it’s one built on the idea that care is a shared responsibility, not a luxury.
Here in America, we’ve built something powerful – some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world. But access to them depends on what’s in your wallet.
Unfortunately, we also end up paying more for worse results by almost every measure: lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, and higher rates of chronic illness than other wealthy nations. In the country with the largest economy in the world, we still treat health care like a privilege to be earned. We’ve built a system where survival comes with fine print, where you can buy a truck on credit more easily than you can see a specialist.
I don’t bring this up as a political argument. This isn’t about right or left, it’s about right or wrong.
It’s about neighbors, parents, co-workers – about the next time you hear someone cough in a quiet room and realize how fragile we all are – how easily health can become debt.
When I think about the future I think about my children and how I want them to inherit something better than this quiet cruelty. I want them to live in a country where care isn’t a privilege you earn but a promise we keep to one another.
Because someday, it won’t just be a headline. It’ll be someone you love sitting in an exam room, staring at a clipboard, doing the math in their head.
Wondering if healing is something they can afford.
We can do better than that.
We have to.
Because in the land of plenty, no one should have to go broke just to stay alive.

Built after the previous one was destroyed by Hurricane Ida, residents can now go there for free therapy, paid for with funds from the parish’s cut of Louisiana’s opioid settlement money.
“We really wanted to make sure that when people wanted the help they had someone they could call,” says Nicole Bourgeois, a Lafourche Parish native who filled different mental health related roles for the parish until the new funding enabled them to pay her as a full-time counselor.
The free counseling program is a rare example of opioid money directly reaching people in Louisiana who need help. Three years into the process of paying out funds from landmark settlements reached between states and major opioid producers and distributors, it’s hard to see what Louisiana has done to combat addiction with the roughly $100 million disbursed across the state.
Meanwhile, the opioid crisis continues to claim hundreds of lives every year in the state alone.

The devastation had led municipalities across the country to sue companies like Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma and Walgreens. Together they secured billions in settlements from the industry and created a system where each state drew up its own rules for spending the money.
While there are national guidelines that feature in each state’s approach, the resulting programs vary widely state-by-state, primarily in the way funds are distributed and spending is overseen.
Louisiana took a decentralized approach, dispersing money to local jurisdictions who operate with little oversight from a task force and supporting state-run nonprofit established by then-Attorney General Jeff Landry.
No other state gives as much of its power to fund opioid abatement directly to local law enforcement. Louisiana is also the only state with no state-level program, apart from operating costs for the nonprofit and task force, while directing 20% of the funds to local sheriffs.

Spending some of the funding on law enforcement and the criminal justice system at large is sensible, says Jason Stoltman founder and director of the Opioid Policy Institute, which he founded in 2020 to bridge the gap between knowledge and action about opioid addiction. Recently, the institute co-created a website where suspected waste, fraud and abuse can be reported.
In Louisiana, reports include a complaint about the 20% allocation to sheriffs and a $250,000 full-body X-ray purchased by the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office for the local jail.
“I have no problem with even a good chunk of money going to law enforcement,” he notes. “I do want them to find the people who are making pressed fentanyl pills that are killing people. If it goes to investigations, if it goes to the correctional system to help people with opioid use disorder in the correctional system — great, whatever,” he adds. “But it can’t be all.”
The money allocated to law enforcement doesn’t end with the $20.2 million distributed to Louisiana sheriffs so far. Most parishes have allocated a majority of their funding to local courts and district attorney’s offices. Police departments, too, are vying for the funds. All of Terrebonne Parish’s expenditures reported as of this year, close to $1 million, went to the Houma Police Department.

Funds allocated to courts or DA’s offices primarily go toward drug-court related expenses, according to reports obtained by The Current, although it’s unclear to what extent they fund additional positions or reduce associated costs for participants in drug court or pre-trial diversion programs.
“We’ve always tried to do what we can,” says Beauregard Parish District Attorney Brian Lestage, referring to his staff’s commitment to exploring alternative options for those facing criminal charges and living with addiction. His office receives $2,200 per month from the local police jury, paid out of the parish’s opioid funds. “It allows accountability and focus that you’re going to spend those hours,” he asserts.
In many cases that spending is labeled as “treatment,” including in Beauregard, despite none of the funds going directly toward treating people suffering from opioid addiction. “It’s hard to drill down and be like: Did it actually go to real treatment that helps people?” Stoltman says. Over the first two years of reported spending, $1.6 million worth have been labeled as treatment-related expenses, despite a significant portion of those funds going to DA’s offices.
“We would expect any community organization to get this money, to show what the impact is,” he points out. “I expect that of law enforcement.”

Toothless
Transparency on how funding is spent, however, is severely lacking in Louisiana.
Sheriffs aren’t required to publicly report their spending, leaving it up to state auditors, who otherwise have little involvement with opioid abatement, to find evidence of misuse. Parishes are supposed to report their spending to the Louisiana Opioid Abatement Task Force.
To date, only 35 parishes have filed reports for the first two years worth of funds, with only 23 reporting any funds spent.
The Louisiana Opioid Abatement Administration Corp., the nonprofit created to receive and administer settlement funds, and support the task force in carrying out its responsibilities, says it’s still analyzing the latest reports covering the third year of funding, which were due in March of this year. It is unclear how many of those reports have been filed by parishes so far. Administrators haven’t furnished the reports in response to several records requests by The Current.
Meanwhile, the task force’s primary role is to advise parishes on spending priorities and review their spending by way of reports. But it’s functionally toothless. The memorandum of understanding establishing the task force doesn’t equip it with any enforcement tools.
“They don’t have the authority to intercept funds,” says Vic Franckiewicz, the task force’s outside legal counsel.
Still, administrators say they’re working with parishes that haven’t yet filed their reports to identify and clear any issues they might face. They also say they’re putting together a report on the task force’s activities, the first since its board first met three years ago.
This leaves a power vacuum that creates no meaningful oversight, a May report by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor pointed out. “No entity has been specifically tasked with enforcing the terms of the opioid settlement agreements in Louisiana,” auditors concluded.
“I think the task force has the ability to do this,” says Otha “Curtis” Nelson, the corporation’s executive counsel. “We’re just into year five of this entire process.”
Even in states where funding is allocated directly to local governments, it’s possible to create a transparent system that allows for public oversight and offers opportunities for a wide variety of groups to apply.

‘People’s money’
In November 2022, the same month that Louisiana’s task force first met, in neighboring Arkansas, cities and counties banded together to create the Arkansas Opioid Recovery Partnership to administer their share of the money.
The partnership reviews and then approves or denies projects proposed across the state, publishing every decision, along with project descriptions, on a dedicated website.
“Being that you’re dealing with people’s money, we wanted to be very transparent,” says Kirk Lane, the partnership’s director and a former chief of police of Benton, Arkansas. “We didn’t want anything slipping through the cracks.”
As of October, the partnership has received 513 applications requesting a total of $424 million, of which 208 projects at a cost of $32 million were approved, funding purchases of the overdose-reversing drug Naloxone, hundreds of sober living beds and peer recovery specialists, among a plethora of other prevention, treatment and recovery projects.
Every county in the state currently has at least one project funded through the partnership’s portion of Arkansas’ opioid abatement funds. Where the state was investing heavily in for-profit treatment providers, Lane says the partnership decided to focus on the nonprofit space and recovery programming, especially in rural and underserved areas.
“Because we’re trying to build new arrows in that quiver that could really help the population that was there,” he explains the partnership’s approach. “They don’t have to travel across three or four counties or parishes to get help. They could actually go right there where they live.”
Louisiana has a pot of money that could fund a similar program but has been slow to spend that too.
As of Oct. 2024, Louisiana had set aside $3.7 million (the equivalent of 3% of total settlement funds) for administrative costs, less than half a million of which had been spent, according to the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report.
For comparison, in Arkansas, the cost of operating several websites, an app that provides training on how to use Naloxone, and the partnership’s four-person staff has come in at just under $1.5 million so far, representing less than 2% of the state’s settlement funds.
Meanwhile, local recipients in Louisiana say they could use the help.
Long hours, inconsistent schedules and weeks spent away from home working on oil rigs and tugboats are a common fact of life for many of Louisiana’s coastal residents, putting a strain on mental health and family structures that can contribute to addiction. (Photo by Alena Maschke/The Current)
In need of guidance
Parishes and sheriff’s offices say they could use some help too. Several that have not spent funds said they are looking to the state’s task force for direction, according to a legislative auditor’s survey.
Whether the current task force is equipped to provide that guidance is doubtful.
Unlike Lane in Arkansas, none of Louisiana’s task force members appointed to represent local governments have a track record of working specifically on the issue of drugs or opioids. There are two physicians. One of which had to recently clarify to a task force member that fentanyl is an opioid, as the group weighed creating an “opioid czar.”
Outside of the two physicians, the remaining task force members are appointed by the Louisiana Municipal Association, the Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association and the Police Jury Association of Louisiana. Administrative support is provided by the Louisiana District Attorney’s Association.
If left unused, any funds set aside for administrative expenses would eventually also be distributed to the parishes and sheriffs, the auditor’s report notes.
The slow pace at which Louisiana and other states have moved in spending their funds is frustrating to experts like Stoltman. “It’s an active crisis,” he says. “Nobody’s acting with the speed that’s needed.”
Since the Louisiana Opioid Abatement Administration Corp. recorded its first deposit of opioid settlement funds at the end of 2022, over 2,000 Louisianans have died from opioid-related overdoses.
Seeing the opioid settlement funds simply as positions in a budget and an administrative task to tackle risks its potential to save lives and keep families whole, Lane notes. “Early on we called it blood money,” he says. “You got to look at it as hope.”

Erin Stewart is betting it is.,"Erin Stewart is chronically unfiltered, casually profane and rarely off the record. Over coffee at Cafe Busy Bean, a brisk one-minute walk from her recently vacated office in New Britain’s City Hall, Stewart inquired about the recording app on a reporter’s iPhone. She wanted to make sure it was on.
For the past dozen years, Stewart has been viewed in political circles as occupying a space between curiosity and bona fide phenomenon — a young, white Republican woman elected mayor at age 26 in a Democratic city of 74,000, where 63% of the population are people of color.
Now 38, she is one of two declared candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, hell-bent on testing the notion that the Grand Old Party is ready to be led by a firefighter’s salty daughter, a blue-collar product of New Britain’s public schools and its Central Connecticut State University.
She is a digital native who began posting an edgy series of YouTube videos 11 months ago titled, “Erin It Out.” In the debut, she described a drunken alderman questioning her legitimacy as mayor, bullying her with vulgarities that Stewart quoted in full. Another off-color episode was titled, “WTF?”
Her campaign video announcement posted on Nov. 18, a week after exiting City Hall with an undefeated record in six mayoral elections. It was devoid of f-bombs but opened with a 10-second parody mocking typical campaign promises and pieties, followed by a pivot to a candidate promising something different.

“When we were talking about what we wanted to do, I said, ‘I don’t want to do some cookie-cutter bullshit.’ I just want to be me,” Stewart said. “If you think that anybody’s gonna not let me be me, I got a problem, and I’m out. I can’t. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to pretend to be somebody that I’m not.”
In her first public campaign event, a rally two days later in the chilly concourse of the New Britain ballpark abandoned in 2015 by the Colorado Rockies Double-A affiliate for flashier new digs in Hartford, she told supporters that the rationale for her campaign was simple.
“You are going to hear this a lot,” Stewart said. “Because it’s time for something different.”
Something different. 
Much is packed into those two words. 
“Oh, God, so much,” Stewart said. “I mean, just first off, look at me, right? My age, my background as a 12-year mayor of a very Democrat city in Connecticut. I mean, I’m a mom of two, working mom of two young kids — or maybe not so working anymore.”

Laughing, she corrected herself. Since noon on Nov. 12, she’s been jobless: “An unemployed mom of two young kids, and I gonna have to lean into that, right?”
Stewart says she already has been asked in a radio interview how she will manage as a candidate and mother, a question she rarely hears posed to men. (John G. Rowland was 33 and the father of three young children when he won the GOP nomination in 1990.)
She is married to Domenic Mutone, a city employee whom she met rom-com-cute on a ride-along with a snow-plow driver during her first big snowstorm as mayor. Their engagement picture was taken on the plow. Through what she called non-mayoral promotions, he became a general foreman and then a superintendent in the city’s public works department. They are parents of a boy and girl, ages 2 and 5.
Something different also is a gibe at the two rich businessmen who led Republicans to defeat in Connecticut’s past four gubernatorial elections: Tom Foley losing to Dannel P. Malloy in 2010 and 2014, and Bob Stefanowski losing to Ned Lamont in 2018 and 2022. They also are a dig at Lamont, 71, a beneficiary of both generational and entrepreneurial wealth whose home is Greenwich. 
Neither Foley nor Stefanowski had previously sought elective office, but both brought a willingness to spend their own funds, as did Lamont. Stewart intends to the use the state’s public financing program.
Her rival for the GOP nomination is a younger son of Greenwich, state Sen. Ryan Fazio. He is a 35-year-old investment advisor and graduate of Greenwich High School and Northwestern University. In his third term, he has been endorsed by the leaders of the legislature’s Republican minorities, Sen. Stephen Harding of Brookfield and Rep. Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford.
And Stefanowski, who considered Stewart as a running mate in 2022, extended an informal endorsement of Fazio on Lee Elci’s radio show, a popular venue for Republicans. Stefanowski is a foil in one of the stories Stewart tells about her being different, someone who might expand the GOP base.

“My God, I have to tell this story,” Stewart said. “It’s, like, embarrassing, but I have to tell it.”
And she does.
Stewart described Stefanowski and his wife, Amy, accepting her invitation to her inaugural ball in 2021, a fundraiser for charity.
“This was when I was being rumored as running as his lieutenant governor. I was going through a whole other thing with that,” Stewart said. “And he looks to me, and he comes up to me with someone else, and they go, ‘There’s so many people of color in the room, Erin.’ And I looked at them, and I just kind of I took a deep breath, and I go, ‘That’s what winning looks like.’”
Stefanowski had no comment.
Stewart’s appeal to a demographic atypical of Republican candidates was undeniable during her six runs for mayor, but is it scalable? Or reflective of an instinctive retail politician’s ability to engage in a smallish city where everyone seems to know everyone else?
She said she believes both can be true, while readily acknowledging that social circles in New Britain can be surprisingly small. Her Democratic successor, Bobby Sanchez, is the uncle of Stewart’s old boyfriend, Manny Sanchez, now a Democratic state representative.

Her father, Timothy Stewart, a retired firefighter, is a former mayor who left office in 2011. Only two years — and a one-term Democrat she unseated — separate her tenure from his. Her great uncle was Dominic J. Badolato, an AFSCME leader who represented New Britain in the General Assembly for two decades, winning collective bargaining for state and municipal employees.
“One of the things about growing up in a community like New Britain, which I think that people who live in urban centers can relate to, is that you learn how to shift and adapt pretty quickly to your environment to make it by,” Stewart said. “You can put me in the middle of Greenwich or Darien, and I’ll be OK. Certainly not going to be using terminology that I would use here. There would be a refined version of what you see. But, not, you know, not too much.”
Her opening message included an appeal to urban voters, at least on the issue of school choice, less so on the prospect of nudging suburbs to be more open to affordable housing. At the ballpark, she spoke of Connecticut as a rich state with a deficit of opportunities.
“The opportunity to live here and retire here without getting shackled by taxes and the highest cost of living in the country. Or to pay electric bills without having to win the damn lottery. The opportunity for a mother in Bridgeport to send her kid to school knowing that they’re getting a great education, and if she can’t, then the opportunity for that mom to send her kids to a school who can,” Stewart said. “How about the opportunity to live in a town where zoning decisions aren’t being made by Ned Lamont and the Hartford clowns?”

What does she mean about giving that Bridgeport mom a choice? Does that mean the right to send her child to a school in neighboring Fairfield if there is room? Does it mean more charter schools?
“It could mean any of that,” Stewart said. 
Stewart pronounces herself a fan of  “Waiting for Superman,” a 2010 documentary that follows five children vying for entrance into competitive urban charter schools seen as a ticket out of failing public schools. It was made by Davis Guggenheim, the documentarian who won the 2007 Oscar for “An Inconvenient Truth.”
As one of Connecticut’s 10 lowest-performing school districts, New Britain is deemed an Opportunity District by the state, eligible for extra funding intended to promote innovation.  Stewart complained that success can mean a punishing loss of funds. In her view, Connecticut’s system for funding education, primarily through an Education Cost Sharing formula that largely dictates where state education aid goes, is “completely broken.”
Two weeks into her campaign, Stewart is not ready to propose changes, nor disclose who is advising her. 
“You won’t see it yet. OK, we have been meeting extensively about details of the platform, that’s for sure,” Stewart said, adding that her goal is “restructuring the formula of how school districts are given their state education money.”
The run for governor is her second. She briefly was a candidate for the nomination in 2018, abandoned to compete in a three-way primary for lieutenant governor. She finished second.
Her campaign announcement last month came at a dark time for Republicans, hard on the heels of a blue wave in municipal contests that were the first general elections since Donald Trump returned to the White House. A similar result in 2017, the president’s first year office, was followed by a Democratic sweep the next year in Connecticut.
“All I can control is my message,” she said.

That message includes sharing that she voted for Trump in all three of his presidential elections while insisting she should not be defined by him. She said she views his efforts to control border security as a success but questions the depth and breadth of the crackdown on undocumented immigrants.
“Pulling people out of Home Depot to … fill a quota? I could do without that,” she said.
Stewart said she shares Trump’s skepticism about wind power, mainly because she sees it as too expensive. But she disagreed with his administration issuing a stop-work order on Revolution Wind, an off-shore project that was 80% complete.
“To be that far along in the process and then just pull a plug on something just to prove a point was pretty, pretty foolish. And then what happens to the workers there?” Stewart said.
“I’m OK with talking about those things, because I don’t believe that feeling like that makes me any less Republican than anyone else,” Stewart said. “However, there are others that are like, I’m supposed to be like Braveheart in the front lines,  carrying the banner.”
In Trump’s first term, Stewart was invited to the White House as an urban mayor happy to applaud his “opportunity zone” policy providing tax incentives in distressed communities. She said they have been a factor in drawing new housing and other developments to New Britain, as have state grants obtained working with the administrations of Lamont and Malloy.
In April, she attended the signing of an executive order “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” It was an opportunity to meet the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, and talk about policies that might bring down the cost of electricity in Connecticut.

She used the visit to make a dig at Fazio, the ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. Stewart said he declined her invitation to join her, fearful of being seen at a Trump administration event.
“And I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’” she said.
Fazio, who did not become a candidate until four months later, recalls the conversation with Stewart differently: there was a discussion about energy issues, not an invitation. Like Stewart, he says he, too, voted three times for Trump.
Lamont has no plan to question either candidate’s fealty to the president.

(Photo from University of Denver)When the attack came, Black Kettle believed it must have been a mistake. The old chief gathered a 33-star United States flag that had been given to him a few years before as a sign of friendship with the federal government and, along with a white flag, hoisted them above his tipi.
But the dawn attack on the Cheyenne and Arapaho encampment at Big Sandy Creek on the cold and snowy high plains of eastern Colorado was no mistake, as would be testified to later at an Army inquiry and a Congressional investigation. The intent of Col. John M. Chivington, commanding more than 700 Union troops that day, was slaughter.
“I long to be wading in gore,” Chivington had declared just days before.
We know what happened next that day from the Army’s perspective largely because of one man, a 26-year-old captain named Silas Soule who refused an unlawful order and stood down his cavalry company while the rest engaged in carnage and worse.
The question of resisting illegal orders becomes a flash point in American politics every generation or so — just think of the My Lai Massacre of 1968 — and it comes today because of revelations about the Trump administration’s boat strikes in international waters. As first reported by The Washington Post, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s spoken order directing the first boat attack was “kill them all.” When two survivors were seen clinging to burning wreckage, missiles were launched to kill them, too.
It is a war crime to kill shipwrecked combatants under the international laws of war, as understood by the U.S. military. The situation is further compounded because no war has been declared in the action that has killed more than 80 individuals alleged to have been drug traffickers, without any evidence given to Congress or the public.
In addition, six Democratic lawmakers, all with prior service, are under investigation by Trump’s FBI for recording a video reminding service members they have a duty to refuse unlawful orders. The video doesn’t mention the boat strikes, but it doesn’t have to.
What is sickening about the threads that runs through Sand Creek, My Lai, and the supposed drug boat strikes, is the inherent racism and coordinated cruelty. In each case, the U.S. military targeted non-white groups of civilians. After annihilating them with superior firepower, their villages were burned to the ground or their boats turned into flotsam, all without trial. But in the cases of Sand Creek and My Lai, there were service members who resisted.
At Sand Creek, it was Silas Soule.
On March 16, 1968, it was 25-year-old helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson Jr. who flew over My Lai and noted the bodies of women and children in an irrigation ditch. He landed and asked Lt. William Calley what was going on.
“Just following orders,” Calley replied.
“Orders? Whose orders?”
“Just following …”
“But these are human beings,” Thompson argued, “unarmed civilians, sir.”
Thompson and his crew got back into their chopper. Those still alive in the ditch were being executed and some of the women raped. At the edge of the village, he spotted soldiers going after about 10 villagers who were running for a bomb shelter. Realizing he was about to witness murder, Thompson landed his helicopter between the soldiers and the villagers. His intervention ended the massacre.
Thompson reported the atrocities to superiors, but his complaints were ignored until news of the massacre broke in the American press. There is no official count of the dead at My Lai, but estimates place the number between 300 and 500. Calley was eventually tried in 1970 and convicted of 22 murders. Calley was one of 25 charged in the case, but the only one convicted.

The Sand Creek Massacre of Nov. 29, 1864, is among the darkest chapters in American history, in which hundreds of Indigenous people — mostly women and children — were slaughtered as retribution for the murder of a family of white settlers at their cabin on Box Elder Creek, more than 100 miles to the northwest. It was assumed they had been killed by an Arapaho raiding party. The mutilated bodies of the four Hungates had been exhumed and put on display in downtown Denver, whipping the city into hysteria. But there was no conclusive evidence that linked the attack to the Arapahos or any other first nation.
In winter 1864, the Civil War was winding down in the states — Colorado was still a frontier territory — and what would come to be known as the Plains Indian Wars was just getting started. Territorial Gov. John Evans had placed Chivington in command of an Indian-fighting regiment, one mostly composed of soldiers who had enlisted for just 100 days and others who were in volunteer companies who had fought the confederates at Glorietta Pass in New Mexico Territory and elsewhere.
Silas Soule was born in Maine and was a radical abolitionist, like his parents. The family came to Lawrence in Kansas Territory in October 1855, settling into a cabin along Coal Creek. Silas became a friend of John Brown and was among the “Immortal Ten” who freed an operator of the Underground Railroad from a Missouri jail.
Silas had sought his fortune during the Pikes Peak gold rush, but at the start of the Civil War he enlisted in a Colorado infantry company. He saw action in New Mexico Territory against the Confederates, including the 1862 battle at Glorieta Pass. By 1864, Soule was captain of a cavalry company assigned to Fort Lyon on the Santa Fe Trail. With his commanding officer, Maj. Edward Wynkoop, he attended several significant peace talks with Cheyenne and Arapaho leaders, including one at Camp Weld at Denver with Black Kettle.
Black Kettle was a leading advocate for peace for his people.
“All we ask is that we have peace with the white,” he said during the Camp Weld Conference, according to the National Park Service page about his life. “We want to hold you by the hand.”
The Cheyenne and other nations were feeling the pressure from white settlement, were buffeted by the volatility of the Civil War, and faced a scarcity of food on the barren lands to which they were increasingly confined. The new reserve at Big Sandy Creek offered a meager bounty. Some of the First Peoples had turned to cattle theft to keep from starving, while others engaged in a shooting war and sometimes took white hostages. There were scores of dead on both sides.
In late November 1864, Chivington — who wanted a victory against the Indians to launch a political career — decided to attack the encampment at Big Sandy Creek. Black Kettle thought the camp was safe from attack because he had reported to Fort Lyon and had been told to return to his camp to await an official delegation.
Chivington, the “fighting parson,” had been a Methodist missionary in Kansas and Nebraska but allowed his men to drink heavily the night before the attack. Along the way, he had posted guards at farms and outposts to prevent anyone from warning Black Kettle. He also had a heated argument with Soule, who said he thought the encampment of Cheyenne and Arapaho were not preparing for war.
“Any man that would take part in the murders, knowing the circumstances as we do, is a low-lived cowardly son of a bitch,” Soule said.
Chivington accused Soule of inciting mutiny and threatened to have him hanged. During the attack, Soule refused to take part and led his company of about 100 men a distance away, across the creek.
Barking dogs alerted the village of Chivington’s approach.
Chivington’s troops circled the village and separated the inhabitants from their pony herds. He then fired withering volleys of grape shot from his quartet of 12-pounder mountain howitzers. Then for the next eight hours — using artillery, rifles, pistols, hatchets and knives — his troops slaughtered hundreds of men, women and children.
Soule may not have interfered because his company was outnumbered by Chivington’s men 6 to 1.
There is no definitive count of the dead, but estimates range from 150 to 600. The National Park Service places the number at 230. Some warriors resisted the onslaught, but most of those in the encampment ran for their lives, seeking refuge in crevices along the banks of the Big Sandy or farther out on the plains. Others fled down the creek and dug sand pits for protection. They were blasted with more cannon fire.
Some of Chivington’s men raped the village women, killed babies, and mutilated bodies. Chivington had illegally ordered his men to take scalps, but a few also hacked genitalia from their female victims as trophies and later displayed them in Denver.
“When the Indians found there was no hope for them they went for the Creek and got under the banks and some of the (men) got their bows and a few rifles and defended themselves as well as they could,” Soule would later write his friend, Wynkoop. “By this time there was no organization among our troops. They were a perfect mob — every man on his own hook. My (company) was the only one that kept their formation, and we did not fire a shot.”
He described some of the atrocities that followed.
“I tell you, Ned, it was hard to see little children on their knees have their brains beat out by men professing to be civilized,” he wrote. “One (woman) was wounded a fellow took a hatchet to finish her, and he cut one arm off, and held the other with one hand and dashed the hatchet through her brain. One squaw with her two children, were on their knees, begging for the lives … the (mother) took a knife and cut the throats of both children and then killed herself.”
Although the killings were initially reported as a victory in Denver, reports of a massacre began to circulate. Investigations were launched, and Soule was the star witness. Chivington claimed the village was hostile and that the sand pits were actually pre-dug rifle pits, but the evidence was overwhelmingly against him. Although Chivington was condemned by a military justice panel, no charges were brought — against him or anyone else.
Black Kettle survived the massacre, as did his wife Medicine Woman Later, who was wounded nine times. Both were shot to death four years later by Custer’s Seventh Cavalry at the Battle of the Washita River near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma. It should be noted that the Cheyenne and Arapaho have their own histories of Sand Creek, which differ in significant ways from the predominantly white military narrative. I referred to some of these accounts in a chapter in my 2018 University Press of Kansas book, “Elevations.”
Soule lived only a few months after Sand Creek. He was killed by an assassin outside his Denver home on April 23, 1865.
Soule and Thompson have been called heroes, but the term falls short. They had courage, either to stand down or to stand up, but to describe their actions as heroic fails the element of basic human decency behind their decisions. They did what a rational person, familiar with American law and military custom, should do in similar circumstances. They were citizens, sworn to the U.S. Constitution, and beholden to an ideal instead of a commander. War is an awful business, fraught with moral ambiguity, but atrocities like Sand Creek and My Lai present a bright clear line of duty and conscience.
Seldom has that line been so apparent, and crossed so fragrantly as in the current boat attacks.
Assuming the boats were transporting drugs — and again, there has been no evidence presented to support that claim — the military should not be used as an execution force at the whim of politicians. We are not engaged in a war with drug traffickers. Annihilating a boat in the Caribbean is not the same as sending Seal Team 6 to kill Osama bin Laden, who personally directed the hijackers responsible the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
The continuing drug boat executions is contrary to the ideals of American democracy, military code and international law. But this time the atrocities are coming not from commanders on the ground but from the very top, the secretary of defense. In doing so, Hegseth displays a chilling embrace of killing civilians for political capital. His disproportionate use of power is the point.
A recent closed-door viewing by lawmakers of video from the Sept. 2 “double tap” strike that killed the shipwrecked survivors raised new questions, according to reporting by The New York Times. The men were monitored for up to an hour before the second attack, clinging to the bow of their capsized boat and trying in vain to right it. They were also seen in the video waving, although it wasn’t clear whether they were trying to summon help or ward off another attack.
Adm. Mitch Bradley, the operation’s commander, reportedly told lawmakers in the closed session that Hegseth hadn’t issued a “no quarter” order when it came to survivors. Trump administration explanations for the second strike have ranged from sinking the boat so it wouldn’t be a navigation hazard to stopping the men from recovering floating bales of drugs and continuing their mission.
But eliminating witnesses to the murders of other civilians might be the real motive. Somebody, somewhere, should have had the guts to try to stop this atrocity.
What allowed Soule and Thompson and others unknown to make the difficult choice to place themselves in physical and political jeopardy was a belief in the limits of force. These men were not pacifists. But they understood the civic sin of indiscriminate killing and wanton slaughter. In this, they separated themselves — and us — from those whose only excuse was that they were just following orders.

Maybe you missed this news, perhaps disturbed (yet unsurprised) by our President’s daily tirades… attacking Somalis as “garbage” one day, pardoning a convicted drug smuggler the next or his continued threats of invading Venezuela.  How easily we miss the closer-to-home news by getting distracted by these “bright, shiny objects.”
We all know that Connecticut drivers must cope with some of the highest gas prices, longest commutes, and oldest highways in the Northeast.  Now Washington has decided to dramatically weaken fuel-economy standards for new cars, cutting the 2031 target from roughly 50 mpg to about 34.  This threatens to make things worse for everyone, especially current and future electric-vehicle owners.
On the surface, the rollback is pitched by the White House as a win for “affordable cars,” claiming that these relaxed miles-per-gallon rules will shave maybe $900 off the cost of a new gas-powered SUV.  But for Connecticut commuters who routinely log 12,000–15,000 miles a year, those savings will evaporate quickly:  cars that burn more fuel cost more to operate, and in a pricey state like ours, the pump always gets paid.
But the bigger, less obvious impact of the mileage rules will be on electric-vehicle drivers– the very people who bought into the promise of lower operating costs, cleaner air, and a modernized transportation system.
According to the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles, there are 2.7 million cars and trucks in our small state.  But only about 60,000 of them are EVs.
For those current EV owners, the MPG rollback creates more uncertainty… beyond just finding a charging station.  EV resale values depend on strong future demand.  So when Washington signals that gasoline-powered cars will stay dominant longer, that EV market may sputter.  Fewer people will shop for EVs, fewer choose them, and used EV prices will likely soften.  
Federal tax incentives (up to $7,500) for new EV buyers already expired this fall but some Connecticut rebates continue… for now.
Then there’s the EV charging network — or, more accurately, the charging network we were promised. Federal programs launched with great fanfare in 2021 pledged 500,000 publicly available chargers nationwide. But fewer than 400 federally funded chargers have actually been built under the $7.5 billion program.
In Connecticut, fast-charging deserts for thirsty EVs persist across Litchfield County, the Quiet Corner, and shoreline towns east of New Haven. Even Fairfield County’s charging stations, while more plentiful, are frequently congested or out of service.
For future EV buyers, the rollback removes one of the biggest forces pushing automakers to build affordable electric models.  Without strict fuel-economy rules, carmakers can meet federal requirements by selling profitable gas-powered SUVs rather than investing in lower-cost EVs that would appeal to everyday drivers. The result? Slower arrival of mid-priced EVs, the very models that would make ‘going electric’ a realistic choice for middle-class families in these tight times.
Remember four years ago when Elon Musk promised us a Tesla for $25,000? In fact the new entry-level models now cost about $37,000 or more.
Here in Connecticut, where we import every gallon of fuel we burn, a slowdown in EV adoption is more than an environmental setback. It’s an economic one. More money will leave the state for out-of-region fuel suppliers. And an unreliable, underbuilt charging network threatens to stall our transportation future.
The real bottom line? You may find new gas-powered cars will be cheaper, but the cost of driving them will go up in (exhaust) smoke.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tesla-charging.jpg,,,2025-12-07 04:57:43.984782

The report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) examines Gulf Correctional Institution near Wewahitchka, which houses approximately 1,600 men. Certain staff members contributed, the report says, to what the SPLC labels “the culture of violence” through overly harsh punishments and degradation of people under their supervision.
The specifics include:

Property restriction, stripping inmates in solitary confinement down to their underwear, taking all their property, and leaving them to sleep on a cold, steel bunk for up to three days.
Denying meals for innocuous misconduct and delivering “air trays” to people in solitary confinement; for the benefit of the prison cameras, officers deliver a meal tray covered by a lid, with no food under that lid.
“Standing on the grate,” a practice of forcing people to stand over the storm drains in the yard for hours, sometimes stripped to their underwear or with their arms and legs in uncomfortable positions.
“Catfishing,” a practice in which officers order barbers to shave off all of someone’s hair and eyebrows.
Administering chemical agents like pepper spray to various parts of the body, including the mouth, ears, groin, and buttocks.
Verbal abuse and harassment, including racial slurs and threats of physical and sexual violence.

The SPLC team identified at least 200 incarcerated victims or witnesses and interviewed 95 of them, the report says. They requested and reviewed more than 20,000 pages of prison, health care, and Office of Inspector General reports covering at least 1,100 incidents over the past decade.
The authors added that the FDC resisted their efforts to gather information.
“In response to public records requests, FDC demanded payment of exorbitant fees — often thousands of dollars — before production. After payment, FDC took months to produce records, only then revealing that it had frequently forced the SPLC to pay for duplicates, records that SPLC did not actually request, and unjustified redactions.”
The report adds that, despite those barriers, “for the 27 victims and witnesses at Gulf who had corroborating prison records and were willing to come forward, the team documented their stories in declarations sworn under penalty of perjury.”
Those first-person accounts are included in an appendix to the report.
“Officers respond to small and big provocations with vicious beatings — punching people all over their bodies,” said Kelly Knapp, a senior staff attorney for the SPLC, in a video interview provided in the online summary. “Hitting them with their walkie-talkies. Choking people. Spraying them at close range with pepper spray in their eyes and their mouth and their ears. Sometimes pulling down their pants and spraying pepper spray between their buttocks.”
“I think if one-tenth of that is true, it highlights the fact that we have a department of chaos, and that these institutions that are anemically understaffed are the worst actors, and the places where the state has failed its citizens the most,” former Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes told the Phoenix after reading the report.
Knapp said that with a vacancy rate for officers at around 50%, correction officers at Gulf are “overtaxed and overburdened.”
Staffing shortages
Florida prisons have faced significant staffing shortages throughout the years. They house more than 89,000 inmates, a population that has increased by more than 10,000 since 2021. That is expected to rise by another 4,100 over the next three years.
“We are managing today with relatively the same number of staff we had 10,000 inmates ago, so you can imagine what that’s doing to the staff and inmate ratios,” FCD Secretary Ricky Dixon told lawmakers in October.
The report says that as of September 2023, the operational staff vacancy rate at Gulf Correctional was 58%, tied for third highest in the state, according to consultants hired by FDC.
“The burden of overcrowding and understaffing often results in dangerous consequences for people incarcerated at Gulf,” the report says.
“Without adequate officer and investigator staffing, prison gangs thrive and perpetrate violence at the facility. Nearly every person interviewed reported that gangs essentially run the institution, with some officers afraid to intervene in attacks, indifferent to the violence, or complicit in their actions. For example, interviewees reported that certain officers frequently allowed people to enter through locked doors into dorms or cells without authorization to assault others at the facility or transfer contraband.”
Marc Caruso worked as a Florida corrections officer from 2010 to 2020.
“They need a whole new leadership from the top down,” he says in a video interview provided in the online summary of the report.
“The officers are tired. They’re burnt out. They know that we need new leadership. It’s the only way to make change in the department. You have to start at the top. You have to have a secretary that’s willing to take a bold stance on getting rid of the corruption in the department. And he has to have the backing of the governor. That’s the only way to do it.”
Since leaving the Legislature in 2022, Brandes founded and heads the Florida Policy Project, a think tank that focuses on statewide issues including criminal justice reform. He said the report “highlights how desperate the Department of Corrections is to address staffing and how, frankly, the Legislature has failed to adequately fund both the staffing and the oversight of these chronically understaffed facilities. “
“They’re setting themselves up for massive litigation over inmates being harmed because of the lack of staffing,” he adds. “At some juncture, it becomes unreasonable, and I think the courts would find that as well.”
The report lists three reforms that could reduce the level of violence in Florida prisons:

Reducing the prison population to “ensure a safe and management staff-to-prisoner ratio;
Investment in greater oversight of facilities and staff.
Improved working conditions and training for correctional staff.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)IOWA CITY — Academics, higher education leaders and Iowa lawmakers called the Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa a good first step in bringing back traditional values of education, intellectual freedom and debate, but they said it must be protected and tightly controlled if it’s going to last.
The center’s two-day inaugural event continued Saturday with discussions of past and current efforts to build similar centers elsewhere in the United States. Discussion also included and updates on how the center at the UI — required by law passed last legislative session and governed by the Iowa Board of Regents rather than the university — came to be and where it’s headed in the future.

Panelists said the fact that the center is on the UI campus and yet outside of the institution’s control is a unique, and positive, aspect of its structure as it shields the center somewhat from hostile acts taken by those within the university.
“If you’re strictly inside, you tend to be taken over by the same forces that have pushed everything else in a certain direction and have been a threat to intellectual freedom,” said Daniel Bonevac, a philosophy professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “If you’re on the outside, then you can largely do what you want, you have almost no impact on the campus.”
Evidence from past efforts inform the new center
Bonevac said the new center has already avoided many “potholes” in how it was set up, but there are others that those who handle the center need to see coming.
Expanding on the theory expressed by Friday panelist Joshua Katz about university faculties and leadership being mostly made up of “sheep” and “crazies,” Bonevac said there also are “fellow travelers” who don’t personally ascribe to radical ideas but who take those voices very seriously. He also described “careers” who will offer their true opinions behind closed doors but not stand up for their thoughts in public.
“Radicals” who want to disrupt programs they are against “find something to complain about,” he said, and often connect it with a specific person who they say needs to go. “Fellow travelers” become concerned not with the program, which they have no problem with, but with the fact that not everyone is happy with what is going on. “Fellow travelers” then talk to “sheep,” who follow their lead, and higher-ups end up getting rid of that person and finding someone who won’t make “waves.”
“In short, you accommodate and you end up looking like you’re controlled by a cabal of the enemies of your original mission,” Bonevac said.

Panel affected by fear of retribution, center head says
The first panel of the day was initially supposed to include three academics, center interim director Luciano de Castro said, but one of the panelists dropped out due to fear of retribution from his university. The sessions held Friday and Saturday morning were originally supposed to be closed from the public, he said, but due to Iowa’s open meetings laws and the fact that enough center advisory council members were attending to make a quorum necessitated opening them to the public.
De Castro said he wasn’t considering this situation as “good” or “bad,” but used it as an example of a “trade-off” that ended with losing someone’s perspective. Aiming to ensure all of what is discussed at the event is available for people to peruse, de Castro said panelists will write articles based on what they presented and have them combined into a book that will be available next year.


He’s seen this happen time and time again at his own university, Bonevac said, with different programs that offered alternative curriculum becoming more “radical” at different paces. He said this was due to original leadership being forced out or leaving for their own reasons and being replaced with those unwilling to defend their mission and letting the program turn into something it was never supposed to be.
One example he provided was of a program he and others tried to create in 2001 called “Western civilization and American institutions,” which garnered donor interest and support from “our people” but opposition from faculty in the history, American studies and English departments. Bonevac said “they made the faculty council not approve this at all” and accused the leader of the initiative of “financial improprieties,” which he called absurd.
The leader was replaced with someone else and, while the program was created, it does not hold its original name and wasn’t what they imagined.
“It’s a good program, but it’s not at all what we had in mind,” he said, “and in terms of the overall effect on the campus, it’s been minimal.”
The best leaders for centers like the one at the UI need to be fully committed to the center’s mission and willing to speak up in its defense, including when that makes people angry. They also need to have a vision of excellence that encompasses the moral and the intellectual, Bonevac said, and be ready to set up a successor before they leave.
Admissions must also be controlled to ensure students “are on board with the mission” of the center, he said.
Chris Clemens, former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill provost, posed four questions to those in the audience directly involved with the center — how will they hire, how will they reach people who aren’t already sympathetic to their goals, what will the center bring to campus and “what adjacent efforts can serve the reformers whose objectives and passions don’t fit to get to this particular focus.”
Rubrics for hiring should be made now and visibly, he said, and those leading the center should be prepared for the day when someone says something “disbelieving.” A communication plan and fallbacks for situations where things go wrong are also necessary to ensure the center stands strong in who is populating it.
Clemens said a common vision must be established for the center, and one of the things that went wrong at UNC was that the “philosophical and methodological differences” of those involved in initiatives were not figured out at the start.
“A center for intellectual freedom that has hiring preference and ideological filters is not a center for intellectual freedom,” Clemens said. “It lives with a contradiction in its soul that will kill it if you don’t resolve it now.”
Current efforts lend confidence to enduring strength
State and federal officials also took the panel stage Saturday to discuss the center’s inception and how they hope to help it succeed.
Regent Christine Hensley said “all the stars have aligned for this to come together,” with former regent and current Trump administration Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education David Barker and herself having both come onto the board with the idea for a center like the one now created and working together to make it a reality.
Barker, also a panelist with Hensley, state Rep. Taylor Collins and state Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, said there wasn’t much interest when he brought the idea forward after joining the board six years ago, due to both money concerns and the lack of awareness of “how bad things had gotten at a lot of universities.”
Collins also drove the creation of the center by discussing legislation to remove diversity, equity and inclusion programs at universities that led to directives to do just that from the board of regents, Barker said, as well as explore the possibility of opening centers “like this.” While the University of Northern Iowa and Iowa State University both developed initiatives as a result of this directive, Collins said there wasn’t much action from the UI.
Hensley said she’s heard from students, their families and “seven-figure donors” who aren’t happy with the political balance of the UI and the “direction of the university.” Multiple panelists said many at the UI are not happy with the center’s creation, and Hensley pointed out there were no UI administrators in attendance. There have been “challenges” in working with the university, she said, in terms of logistics and competing information.
Neither UI nor board of regents spokespeople could say whether anyone from the UI was invited to the event.
With an advisory committee and bylaws set for the center, Hensley said next steps include launching the national search for a permanent director and conducting a marketing study to learn more about what classes and other resources should be offered through the center.
“I am extremely confident that we’re going to be very, very successful,” Hensley said.
What gives Barker confidence in the center is the quality of its advisory board, he said, and he hopes the center will develop surveys similar to free speech surveys already taken by Iowa university students to see whether students and faculty feel comfortable sharing what they feel in the classroom.
A question directed at Hensley asked why, if UI officials aren’t cooperating, can’t the board of regents just remove those leaders, to which she responded that leadership on the board of regents has recently changed and she is “hopeful” that this can be dealt with.
“I think that we have past leadership that just were not willing to deal with those issues, and the change in the leadership will begin to address those,” she said.
University of Iowa graduate student Clara Reynen asked panelists how the idea of universities getting worse as older faculty bring in new people with the same ideas and beliefs, which was expressed in Friday’s panels, can coexist with the fact that advisory committee members were chosen by de Castro and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and approved by the board rather than through an application process or other means.
De Castro said there were discussions in the creation of the center about its director having too much power, and the advisory council was created to be “out of reach” of the director and made up of people who will not go along with the majority decision and disagree when necessary.
“I want to emphasize this — this center is not about politics, it’s not about ideology, it’s about truth,” de Castro said. “It’s about academic excellence, and this we’re going to strive for.”

Danville residents voted overwhelmingly on Saturday against shuttering high school grades at the Danville School.
Well over 500 residents cast paper ballot votes during a townwide referendum at Danville School, with 480 votes against a measure to close high school grades versus 75 in favor, according to Danville’s moderator Toby Balivet.
“I’m proud of the town for turning out, I’m ecstatic for the turnout,” Danville school board Chair Clayton Cargill said after the results were announced.
The results sent a loud and clear message to the Caledonia Central Supervisory Union and Danville school board officials to keep high school grades open. After the results were announced, Cargill said it’s “pretty obvious that this town wants to be a town that operates a high school.”
“The town is proud of the high school,” he said, adding that the school board would “take that advice to heart.”
The referendum was first spurred by a citizen’s petition to close high school grades by June 30 and instead pay tuition for those high school students to attend other public or private schools.
Peter Mantius, a Danville resident and St. Johnsbury Academy teacher, submitted the petition, signed by more than 100 residents, in October.

The effort was partly motivated by anxiety around the future of school choice. State Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia — a St. Johnsbury teacher — cautioned Cargill that legislation this upcoming session could limit school choice options in the future, and suggested the district should consider whether to shutter high school grades to maintain school-choice options in the future.
Cargill has since filed an ethics complaint against Beck, alleging he pushed for grade closures that would benefit the private school where he works.
School employees and officials, the community and students feared that closure would otherwise leave the region a public high school desert.
But the vote was complicated this week, when attorneys contracted by the district said the petition could not compel the Danville school board to move forward with closure — making Saturday’s referendum nonbinding.
School board officials previously said they would decide whether to go forward with closure based on the results of the referendum.

A poll released days later by the University of Massachusetts Amherst affirmed as much, with one in five respondents rating their own economic situation as “poor” and housing emerging as the most important issue facing Massachusetts.  
Yet while Massachusetts families struggle to make ends meet, Eversource’s CEO is boasting record quarterly earnings, driven by revenue collected from recent rate hikes. As we head into winter and heating bills climb, our leaders on Beacon Hill should stop quibbling about distant 2030 climate goals and instead focus on the root causes of rising energy costs today: runaway utility infrastructure spending, corporate greed, and an over-reliance on methane gas.  
Across the country, elected leaders are tackling affordability head-on.  
In New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani built his campaign around lowering the cost of living, from the lunch rush to the cost of rent. In New Jersey, where residents struggle with similar energy dilemmas as those facing Massachusetts, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill won handily by pledging to declare a state of emergency and freeze utility bills. In Georgia, the data center capital of the country, fed-up voters elected two pro-renewables candidates to the statewide Public Service Commission.  
Meanwhile, here in Massachusetts, Gov. Healey has put forward an energy affordability agenda, with her proposed legislation promising to result in $10 billion in savings. Legislators have similarly offered bills that will help bring energy costs down further by helping municipalities quickly deploy low-cost solar, ensuring new buildings use the latest energy efficiency standards, expanding the use of geothermal energy to heat our homes and buildings, and banning utilities from charging ratepayers for corporate travel, political activity, and advertising expenses.  
These solutions point to the reality we’re facing today: Better equipment and cheaper energy sources are critical to achieving that affordable energy future. And in 2025, as the index for natural gas is rising at nearly four times the rate of inflation, highly efficient electric alternatives like heat pumps powered by clean energy are how we bring down energy bills across Massachusetts. 
Knee-jerk reactions to double down on methane gas will set up Massachusetts families for more, not less, economic hardship. Not only has the price of methane gas risen to be the main source behind recent rate hike requests from Eversource and National Grid, but years of unchecked infrastructure spending has caused delivery charges to rise 20 percent each year since 2014.  
This isn’t just happening in Massachusetts: in 2024, two-thirds of the average gas bill nationwide went to delivery charges, and accelerated gas pipeline replacement spending is the main culprit. According to the American Gas Association, gas pipeline spending hit $49.1 billion in 2023, up 50 percent from the year prior.  
All this spending has sent utility corporate profits into the stratosphere, with Eversource’s electric side alone posting a $367 million profit for third quarter earnings. Eversource’s CEO, Joe Nolan, in 2023 took in almost $19 million from our bills and ranks among the highest paid utility executives in the country.  
Massachusetts has the tools to turn this around. Just as the Fair Share Amendment created free lunch in public schools and closed the MBTA’s operating budget gap by putting a tax on millionaires, Massachusetts can tap into excess corporate profits to create long-term solutions to bring down the cost of energy for working families.  
Our leaders should invest in solutions that ensure our low-income households don’t pay more than they deserve to get the latest, most efficient electric equipment, and landlords should be required to make their properties more affordable for renters by investing in energy efficiency and highly efficient heat pumps.  
There are already bright spots. All-electric building codes are spurring an affordable housing boom in Lexington. Boston’s decades-old steam loop is transitioning to highly efficient heat pumps powered by thermal energy from the Charles River, allowing hundreds of buildings to access cheap, clean heat. Thanks to the Department of Public Utilities, heat pump owners can expect to see more than $500 in savings this winter, and solar, wind, and batteries are driving down energy prices. And late last month, the DPU pushed back on Eversource’s 17 percent rate hike request, resulting in $45 million in savings for 303,000 customers.  
Our climate commitments are starting to crack down on utility overspending as well. This past spring, the DPU made an initial ruling to rein in gas utility pipeline spending, a move that is expected to cut the gas system enhancement plan, or GSEP, surcharge on utility bills by 17 percent. The department also proposed ending line extension allowances, an outdated practice that has allowed gas utilities to pass on the cost of adding new customers to its system to existing customers, a fee that costs ratepayers up to $160 million each year. 
As we head into colder weather and people grapple with higher and higher energy bills, the biggest tool our elected officials can use to help build a more affordable Massachusetts is efficient electric equipment powered by clean energy. It’s time they use it.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers sent a letter to House leadership seeking urgent reauthorization of the “Secure Rural Schools and Self-Determination Program,” which provided 32 Montana counties with $16 million from the U.S. Forest Service in 2023. 
All four members of Montana’s federal delegation signed on to the letter seeking the funding as a standalone measure or attached to broad, year-end funding legislation. 
But that funding expired in 2023, and was not reauthorized during budget negotiations last year. 
And despite a bill co-sponsored by Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Time Sheehy, passing the Senate in  June, the House has yet to take up a vote. 
The SRS program helps counties with large swaths of public, tax-exempt forest land that previously received revenue from timber sales. The federal government has a funding formula to share 25% of revenue generated on federal land based on economic activity, timber harvest levels and other considerations that vary by county, with payments going toward rural schools, road maintenance and other programs that serve the counties. 
“Rural counties, parishes, and boroughs across the country are already facing the impact of the program’s expiration,” the letter states. “The SRS program underscores the vital partnership between federal land management and local government services, supporting everything from wildfire mitigation and forest health to the maintenance of roads and support of public schools. With longstanding and strong bipartisan support behind SRS, Congress must reaffirm its commitment to these rural counties.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-06 19:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Pediatricians in Mississippi to still recommend Hep B vaccine for newborns despite CDC advisers’ vote,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/06/pediatricians-hep-b-vaccine/,Pediatricians in Mississippi are already witnessing a shift among parents  in how some choose to protect their children against infectious disease was underway even before a group of advisers for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention withdrew their recommendation for hepatitis B vaccines at birth this week.,"Dr. Patricia Tibbs said her pediatric practice in Laurel has gotten “so many rejections” for newborn hepatitis B vaccines in the last year, and she suspects some of those infants may end up with debilitating conditions as a result. 
“The problem with that is that if you are in the process of turning positive for hepatitis B and you did not know you were exposed, and if we don’t give the baby the vaccine at birth, then your baby has acquired it,” said Tibbs, president of the Mississippi chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Mississippi Today. “You can’t stop the process once it’s acquired.”
This shift among how parents choose to protect their children against infectious disease was underway even before a group of advisers convened for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week. Universal hepatitis B vaccines for infants are no longer recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel that advises the federal government on vaccination policy, as a result of a controversial vote Friday. 
The 8-3 vote brought an end to a longstanding recommendation to vaccinate all healthy newborns against hepatitis B, regardless of whether the mother tests positive for the virus. The current committee was hand-picked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he fired 17 former members. In June, Kennedy called his move a “clean sweep” that represents a broader movement to prioritize parental autonomy. Committee members also discussed the childhood immunization schedule but only voted on the recommendation for hepatitis B. 
Several national health associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have come out with statements reiterating the importance of continued recommendation of universal birth doses of the vaccine. On Friday, the American Medical Association called the panel’s decision “reckless.” 
Hepatitis B can spread through sexual contact and drug use, but it can also be transmitted from mothers to infants during childbirth. In infancy, the disease can be transmitted through contact with an infected person’s body fluids, such as their blood. The committee now recommends the vaccine only for babies whose mothers test positive for the virus. For other babies, it will be up to parents and doctors to decide whether a birth dose is appropriate. 
The virus attacks the liver, is often asymptomatic for years, and can present in adulthood as liver cancer, cirrhosis and death. The risks of these outcomes are much higher for people who get infected as infants. There is no cure.
Babies born to mothers who are negative at the time of birth are very unlikely to get the virus. However, if a mother tests negative before birth, she could still contract the virus between the time of testing and birth. Testing at birth is a mostly-effective alternative to immediate vaccination in large hospitals that do speedy in-house testing, but not in smaller, rural hospitals where tests can take days to come back, Tibbs said, adding that there is always a chance of a false negative or infection from someone other than the mother. The newborn vaccine is most effective when administered within 12 hours of birth, experts say. 
The recommendation changes will likely have a greater impact in rural areas. There, mothers are more likely to get tested for the first time at birth, the results may take a while to come back, and infants can miss the 12-hour window, Tibbs said.
“This particular decision is going to impact Mississippi especially a lot,” Tibbs said. “Because we already have issues with adequate prenatal care and places where people travel for hours to get good care.”

Panelists say the vaccine has come up now because the committee is required to periodically review vaccine safety. They say they deemed the hepatitis B vaccine the most important to examine since it is the earliest vaccine given to infants and contains aluminum adjuvants – salts that make some vaccines more effective by stimulating an immune response. 
“We have to be cognizant of the fact that the past several decades have seen an explosion in chronic disease, especially the highest rate in our children,” said ACIP member Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician and gynecologist in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Thursday. “Something is happening, and we have to address that … I’m not saying it is vaccines that is causing this, but vaccines is what we are tasked to explore, so we have to investigate these topics.” 
The new recommendations will not affect access or availability of the vaccine currently available, Andrew Johnson of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said during the meeting. The vaccine will continue to be covered by insurance at no out-of-pocket cost for all beneficiaries. 
“This vote to weaken the hepatitis B dose recommendation will be the first time in my 21 years of experience as a liaison to ACIP that ACIP is voting on a policy that based on all of the available and credible evidence regarding benefits versus harm, it actually put children in this country at higher risk rather than lower risk of disease and death,” said Dr. Amy Middleman, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Oklahoma’s College of Medicine, during the hearing.
Why this, why now?
In 1991, the U.S. pioneered its recommendation that all infants receive a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine on the day of birth. Between 1990 and 2019, reported cases of acute hepatitis B among children declined by 99%. 
Most parents today choose a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, with only 9% choosing to forego or delay it, according to the KFF/Washington Post Survey of Parents conducted last summer. 
About 30 vaccines, excluding flu and Covid shots, are recommended in the U.S. for children. The debate on childhood vaccination has become increasingly contentious as the country becomes more divided. Liberals are more inclined toward vaccination, seeing it as a matter of public health, and conservatives are less inclined toward vaccination, seeing it as a matter of individual freedom. Seventy-four percent of Democrats or those who lean Democrat feel confident that vaccines have been tested enough for safety, while only 35% of Republicans or those who lean Republican believe the same, according to an Oct. 20-26  survey conducted by the Pew Research Center.
Some of the people Kennedy replaced former committee members with are considered controversial for being vaccine skeptical. During this week’s meeting, members pushed back against decades-long practices in disease prevention.
“My personal bias is to err on the side of enabling individual decision making and individual rights over the rights of the collective,” said the committee’s vice president, Dr. Robert Malone, who has said he is not anti-vaccination and has worked in mRNA technology for years, during Friday’s deliberations over when to administer the hepatitis B vaccine. “This is not a trivial thing, and it reflects fundamental, frankly philosophical, disagreements about the role of public health and medical practice.”

“Your role is population health, not the individual,” shot back Dr. Jason Goldman, who has served as a liaison to the committee for the American College of Physicians for almost a decade. “We are looking at what are the population risks and how do we make those recommendations.”
In the two-day session, committee members called for more long-term vaccination studies, including placebo-controlled trials to look at causation with conditions such as asthma, allergies, ADHD and autoimmune disorders. Virologists have long considered it unethical once a vaccine is authorized for use to perform additional studies that withhold the vaccine from placebo patients. 
“Many vaccines have been in existence for decades. When the newer, next-generation vaccine comes along, we are obligated to use the standard of care as the control – not a placebo,” Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease physician-scientist at the University of Maryland Medical Center, told Mississippi Today. Chen was one of the 17 former committee members dismissed in June. 
Before Friday’s vote, the hepatitis B vaccine was recommended for all newborns but not mandated. However, in schools and some pediatricians’ offices, the vaccine is required. More than half of pediatricians’ offices in the U.S. included in a study published in the medical journal JAMA reported having a dismissal policy for families who do not vaccinate their children according to the immunization schedule. 
“I was trained in bioethics that these are things that are not acceptable,” said Malone. “The absence of coercion, compulsion and enticement is the essence of informed consent.”
Mississippi recently added religious exemption, allowing children who do not comply with the recommended immunization schedule to attend school. Before 2023, Mississippi was one of six states that did not allow religious exemption for childhood vaccines. 
Since the exemptions became allowed two years ago, Mississippi went from first in the nation for its rate of childhood immunization to third. 
“Historically, parents all got vaccines,” said Tibbs. “It’s not in my memory for people to reject vaccines until recently.”
The way forward
Two-thirds of Americans don’t trust the health care system today, according to a study from Johns Hopkins University study. That’s up 10 percentage points from 2021, the height of the Covid pandemic. 
Panelists who voted to pass the new hepatitis B recommendations said that increased parental autonomy is necessary to rebuild public trust in the medical industry. They also said that it has never been socially acceptable to talk about adverse effects of vaccines, leading to parents and individuals feeling gaslit and silenced. 
MaryJo Perry, co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights, called the new recommendations a win after she tried to bring these changes to Mississippi in 2017 through a bill authored by Rep. Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven. The bill would have prohibited the state’s Health Department from requiring the hepatitis B vaccine for all infants at the time of birth. 
“I think it’s a shift in the integrity behind the government and the way they represent vaccine science,” said Perry, whose group now has 14,000 followers on Facebook. Perry said most of the families she works with report feeling that their concerns are not taken seriously and are judged or penalized for exercising their right to choose. 
“They get shamed, they get bullied, they are fear-mongered and coerced,” Perry said. “When you have a brand-new baby, it’s supposed to be a wonderful time. And parents just are tired of that, and today’s young mamas are not putting up with it.”
Some doctors who spoke during the hearings expressed concerns that public distrust might grow, since there is now a rift between what ACIP now recommends and what various medical and pediatric associations recommend. They also described the hearings as chaotic and overly anecdotal. 
“These decisions really affect a lot of people’s lives, and we really are obligated to our countrymen to make sure that we do this in an organized process,” said Middleman, the ACIP liaison. “We can’t just dump a pile of unfolded laundry on the floor and then try to determine from that whether or not we need more T-shirts or more pants.”
Pediatricians also expressed their own confusion over how the new recommendations will change practice, if at all, considering the decision has always been up to parents. 
“Is it not going to change anything because people have always been able to opt out?” asked Tibbs, of the Mississippi chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “I won’t stick your baby if you don’t want the hepatitis B vaccine, right? So, is nothing changing?”
As of now, the hepatitis B vaccine will continue to be covered by insurance for all families who choose to receive a birth dose. But Tibbs worries about the possibility insurance companies will stop covering the vaccine down the road. 
“We as pediatricians will continue to follow the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation,” said Dr. Anita Henderson, past president of the group’s Mississippi chapter. “… We are not planning to make any changes to our recommendations, any changes to our policies. We will continue to recommend the vaccine.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/05173441/AP25253623716598.jpg,,,2025-12-06 14:56:52.316018

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.
In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.
The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.
But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.
One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.
After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe.


“We think it’ll probably take a few quarters for the market to stabilize, but the long-term outlook, the fundamentals, the decline in costs and the increasing cost reductions that we’re seeing, all those fundamentals remain solid,” he said.
He is looking ahead to the time when a customer can buy an EV at the same price, or less, compared to a gasoline vehicle with similar features. His organization thinks that will happen across most vehicle segments by 2028 or 2029.
But there will be some milestones before then. Among them is when the total cost of ownership of an EV is the same as or lower than that of a gasoline vehicle, reflecting that an EV has lower fuel and maintenance costs. He anticipates that this will happen several years before purchase-price parity—which is right about now.


Researchers use different methods to calculate the total cost of ownership, making this a challenging metric to agree on. (Car and Driver published an overview this summer of the factors to watch.)
But there is little debate that the costs of EVs will continue to decrease, even with cuts to subsidies.
Automakers, who think in decade-plus time horizons, can see the way things are going. Each company is making strategic choices about how much to maintain gasoline and hybrid vehicle lineups, even as they know electric drivetrains will dominate the long-term future.
“We think this transition is inevitable, and the automakers that can [best navigate] this transition are the ones that are likely to win the race,” Slowik said. “They stand to win big, both at home, in terms of their domestic manufacturing volumes, and their sales shares relative to other automakers, but then also abroad.”
ICCT is a useful resource for understanding this moment. For starters, check out a Nov. 17 blog post that offers data-backed commentary on U.S. policy.
Any attempt to make predictions carries risk. If you’d asked me a year ago, I would not have guessed that Trump would be able to pass a repeal of the EV tax credits.
The credits largely benefited U.S.-based companies such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors, helping them gain a competitive edge over models assembled in other countries that were not eligible.
It didn’t make sense to remove the tax credits—and do so with such suddenness—except for the odd political reality of this year and the way the debate in Congress was dominated by fiscal hardliners.
But the push and pull of adding or subtracting subsidies will ultimately matter less than larger factors, such as the long-term decline in battery costs and the increase in battery efficiency.
In the meantime, the rough sales numbers are going to continue. Let’s reconvene next year at this time and we’ll have a better sense of what the recovery looks like.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Maybe there are lessons to be learned from the federal government shutdown. One of those lessons might be the way the sudden lack of federal funding shines a light on the hidden problems of society that we don’t think about or don’t want to think about. One of those problems is hunger.
As the shutdown progressed, the deadline approached for funding to run out for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The federal SNAP program offers food assistance to 42 million low-income Americans. In South Dakota, it provides food assistance to 75,000 citizens.
That 75,000 number may be hard to quantify. Think of it this way: The combined populations of three of South Dakota’s largest communities totals about 75,000. If you live in Brookings, Aberdeen or Watertown, take a look around at your family, your neighbors, your co-workers. Now imagine them all hungry as the federal SNAP funds dry up. It’s hard to believe so many people in South Dakota are dependent on the federal government for food.
South Dakota won’t tap reserve funds to fill federal food assistance gap, governor says

Another lesson that emerged from the shutdown is the way that state government reacts to a problem. In the case of the SNAP fund, it was met with a shrug, excuses and an admonishment to be generous.
A cynic would say that politics played a role here. With President Donald Trump working overtime to make sure that SNAP funds were withheld from the people who need them, there was no sign that the state’s Republican leadership was going to make waves. There’s no telling that Trump is even aware that there’s a Republican gubernatorial primary brewing for June of next year in South Dakota. Still, the safest precaution for candidates hoping for his endorsement is to follow the big man’s lead for fear of incurring his wrath.
Gov. Larry Rhoden wrote a column about the impending SNAP crisis, blaming Democrats for the shutdown and asking South Dakotans to make donations to local food banks. He also repeated the oft-debunked claim that Democrats were holding government funding hostage in hopes of securing medical benefits for illegal immigrants.
SNAP benefits in South Dakota total $15 million a month, Rhoden explained, bemoaning the logistics of finding a way to replace the federal funds. In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, the governor said that any money the state invested in replacing SNAP funds wouldn’t be reimbursed by the federal government.
The precedent for investing in an emergency without any hope of reimbursement was set by Rhoden’s predecessor. The National Guard deployments that Kristi Noem ordered to the southern border were made with the full knowledge that Texas wasn’t going to reimburse the state for costs that exceeded $1 million.
Since the state’s hands were tied, Rhoden used his column to encourage South Dakotans to be generous, dig deeper and give to their local food pantries. That’s big talk from someone sitting on $413 million in reserve funds.
The reserves are often referred to as money that the state has set aside for a rainy day. Yet with a veritable monsoon of hunger bearing down on 75,000 South Dakotans, the state’s umbrellas and slickers remained safely tucked away.

The uncertainty of a federal government shutdown touches all citizens. Imagine how much better the state’s SNAP recipients would have felt if they knew that their government was doing something, anything, to recognize their plight.
No one would expect the state to reinvent the federal SNAP infrastructure that puts funds on payment cards that recipients can use to buy food. However, it wouldn’t take that much effort to pull together a loose coalition of state, local and tribal officials along with grocers and the people who run food pantries.
No one would expect the state to drop $15 million a month to replace the federal funds. However, someone in the coalition may have a million-dollar idea that makes it easier for grocers to give extra food to their local food banks. With the prospect of the state investing some money, it may be easier for food banks to ease their restrictions on how often someone can go to them for food.
Fortunately, the shutdown ended and federal funds flowed to SNAP accounts once again. However, as so many South Dakotans faced an uncertain future about how they were going to feed their families, it would have been comforting to know that their state government was doing something more substantial than just asking them to rely on the kindness of strangers.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9985-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-06 08:56:27.257343

(Courtesy of the Washington Legislature)Washington lawmakers are warming up for a sprint.
They’ve been pre-filing bills and holding press conferences this week, knowing they’ll have just 60 days to drive their policy ideas through the legislative process once next year’s session starts Jan. 12.
Being proactive, they hope, will get them on the radar of committee and caucus leaders who hold great sway on what legislation will be considered. Competition will be tough. Hundreds of bills introduced but not enacted in the last session are already well-positioned for early votes in the House or Senate.
Here’s a look at a few new bills now in the hopper.
Tax the protest
Not a single Republican legislator voted this year for a new law imposing the retail sales tax on more services, such as temporary staffing, certain digital advertising, and security services.
Now that this tax law is in effect, a Republican state senator wasted little time in pursuing a change to make sure it covers the profession of protesting.

With Senate Bill 5819, Sen. Leonard Christian, R-Spokane Valley, proposes to expand the definition of temporary staffing services to include “providing workers as paid protestors to any person, business, or other entity for limited periods of time to supplement or support a public protest.”
Coverage of protests at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland sparked Christian’s interest. “You see some people over and over on the protest lines,” he said.
If it’s happening here, or if a group is paying Washington residents to protest in Oregon, it probably should be subject to the tax, he said.
“This idea came from the other side of the aisle, saying there’s no such thing as a paid protester,” Christian said. “If the state thinks it can get some money, well, any money is better than nothing with the budget situation.”
Embracing nuclear power
Washington has doggedly pursued ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and curb the state’s appetite for fossil fuels.
It means securing greater supplies of clean energy to power homes, cars and businesses. Solar, wind and hydropower are cornerstones of the state’s strategy. Some heavyweight lawmakers from opposite sides of the aisle think nuclear energy should be one as well.
Identical bills pre-filed in the House and the Senate push the state to more aggressively embrace nuclear energy. They direct the state Department of Commerce to publish a “nuclear power strategic framework” identifying opportunities and obstacles to encouraging, enticing and permitting development of new fission nuclear power generation facilities.
Rep. Stephanie Barnard, R-Pasco, and House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, teamed up in the House while Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia and Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham, are the lead sponsors in the Senate.
There is a catch. Commerce will not get any state dollars. It must secure enough private funds to do the work, or it won’t get done.
Other tax matters
This week brought proposals to impose a new tax on businesses, restore a tax break on bullion and hike a fee used to help new car buyers.
Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah, wants to reinstate a tax exemption on the sale of precious metals and bullion. It is one of a handful of tax breaks Democrats eliminated last session with Senate Bill 5794. If the tax break comes back, the state would lose out on $129 million over the course of this budget and the next one.
Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, is forging ahead with his proposed new tax targeting large employers with high-paid workers. Under his bill, companies with more than 20 employees and $5 million in gross receipts would pay a tax on payroll expenses for those workers earning more than $125,000 a year. He held a press conference Tuesday to tout it.
Two Democratic senators filed the first fee increase proposed for the next session.  It comes at the request of the Attorney General Nick Brown. The bill from Sens. Marcus Riccelli of Spokane and Derek Stanford of Bothell would increase the fee auto buyers pay for the new motor vehicle arbitration account to $6. It is now $3. 
It would be the first update in over three decades to the fee, according to the attorney general’s office. Money is used to help new vehicle owners who have problems with warranty repairs. The account is projected to run into a deficit this fiscal year and an increase would ensure it remains financially solvent.
Tuition break
Washington’s higher education institutions are reeling from lawmakers’ handiwork last session that led to budget cuts, tuition hikes and a crimping of the state’s generous financial aid programs.
Enter Rep. Julia Reed, D-Seattle, with an attempt to reset the scales. 
Her legislation titled “Adjusting higher education funding” would cut tuition by 10% a year for three school years starting in the fall of 2027 and expand eligibility for the Washington College Grant program.
To pay for the changes, she proposes to erase the cap on annual payments of the state’s “advanced computing surcharge.” This may be a sticking point.
This tax is paid by firms with global revenue above $25 billion — think Microsoft and Amazon — and is spent to expand student access to higher education through efforts like the Washington College Grant. Under a law passed last session, the annual cap on payments, now $9 million, will rise to $75 million per taxpayer on Jan. 1.
The notion of erasing it completely came up last session. It may be too soon to revisit.
Political hate crimes
Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Auburn, is once again proposing to make it a hate crime to assault or threaten a person, or damage their property because of their “political affiliation.”
This isn’t his first attempt. Earlier this year, when the state Senate debated and approved an expansion of the state’s hate crime law, Fortunato offered an amendment to add political affiliation to the law’s roster of characteristics, such as race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation
At the time, Fortunato cited an incident at Washington State University in which a student, described as a Republican and member of Turning Point USA, was reportedly attacked by two university employees while wearing a “Trump 2024: Take America Back” hat.
“If we’re going to protect people from violence based on who they are or what they believe, then that must include political views,” Fortunato said at the time. “Otherwise, the law is just a political tool for the majority party.”
In Washington, hate crime offenses are a class C felony that carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years behind bars, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/hopper.jpg,,,2025-12-06 07:57:03.136111

Kennedy Jr. appears before the Senate Finance Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Sept. 4, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The United States is poised to lose its measles-free status next year. If that happens, the country will enter an era in which outbreaks are common again.
More children would be hospitalized because of this preventable disease. Some would lose their hearing. Some would die. Measles is also expensive. A new study — not yet published in a scientific journal — estimates that the public health response to outbreaks with only a couple of cases costs about $244,000. When a patient requires hospital care, costs average $58,600 per case. The study’s estimates suggest that an outbreak the size of the one in West Texas earlier this year, with 762 cases and 99 hospitalizations, costs about $12.6 million.
America’s status hinges on whether the country’s main outbreaks this year stemmed from the big one in West Texas that officially began Jan. 20. If these outbreaks are linked, and go on through Jan. 20 of next year, the U.S. will no longer be among nations that have banished the disease.
“A lot of people worked very hard for a very long time to achieve elimination — years of figuring out how to make vaccines available, get good vaccine coverage, and have a rapid response to outbreaks to limit their spread,” said Paul Rota, a microbiologist who recently retired from a nearly 40-year career at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Instead of acting fast to prevent a measles comeback, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine organization before taking the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services, has undermined the ability of public health officials to prevent and contain outbreaks by eroding trust in vaccines. The measles vaccine is safe and effective: Only 4% of nearly 1,800 confirmed U.S. cases of measles this year have been in people who had received two doses.
Kennedy has fired experts on the vaccine advisory committee to the CDC and has said, without evidence, that vaccines may cause autism, brain swelling, and death. On Nov. 19, scientific information on a CDC webpage about vaccines and autism was replaced with false claims. Kennedy told The New York Times that he ordered the change.
“Do we want to go back into a prevaccine era where 500 kids die of measles each year?” asked Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC’s national immunization center, who resigned in protest of Kennedy’s actions in August. He and other scientists said the Trump administration appears to be occupied more with downplaying the resurgence of measles than with curbing the disease.
HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that vaccination remains the most effective tool for preventing measles and that the “CDC and state and local health agencies continue to work together to assess transmission patterns and ensure an effective public health response.”
Looking for Links
CDC scientists are indeed tracking measles, alongside researchers at health departments and universities. To learn whether outbreaks are linked, they’re looking at the genomes of measles viruses, which contain all their genetic information. Genomic analyses could help reveal the origin of outbreaks and their true size, and alert officials to undetected spread.
Scientists have conducted genomic analyses of HIV, the flu, and covid for years, but it’s new for measles because the virus hasn’t been much of a problem in the U.S. for decades, said Samuel Scarpino, a public health specialist at Northeastern University in Boston. “It’s important to get a surveillance network into place so that we could scale up rapidly if and when we need it,” he said.
“We are working with the CDC and other states to determine whether what we’re seeing is one large outbreak with continued spread from state to state,” said Kelly Oakeson, a genomics researcher at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.
At first glance, the ongoing outbreak in Utah and Arizona, with 258 cases as of Dec. 1, seems linked to the one in Texas because they’re caused by the same strain of measles, D8-9171. But this strain is also spreading throughout Canada and Mexico, which means the outbreaks could have been sparked separately from people infected abroad. If that happened, this technicality could spare the U.S. from losing its status, Rota said. Being measles-free means the virus isn’t circulating in a country continuously year-round.
Canada lost its measles-elimination status in November because authorities couldn’t prove that various outbreaks from the D8-9171 strain were unrelated, said Daniel Salas, executive manager of the comprehensive immunization program at the Pan American Health Organization. The group, which works with the World Health Organization, includes health officials from countries in North, South, and Central America, and the Caribbean. It makes a call on measles elimination based on reports from scientists in the countries it represents.
Early next year, PAHO will hear from U.S. scientists. If their analyses suggest that measles has spread continuously for a year within the U.S., the organization’s director may revoke the country’s status as measles-free.
“We expect countries to be transparent about the information they have,” Salas said. “We will ask questions, like, ‘How did you determine your findings, and did you consider other angles?’”
In anticipation of PAHO’s assessment, Oakeson and other researchers are studying how closely the D8-9171 strains in Utah match others. Instead of looking at only a short snippet of genes that mark the strain, they’re analyzing the entire genome of the measles virus, about 16,000 genetic letters long. Genetic mutations occur naturally over time, and the accumulation of small changes can act like a clock, revealing how much time has ticked by between outbreaks. “This tells us the evolutionary history of samples,” Oakeson said.
For example, if one child directly infects another, the kids will have matching measles viruses. But measles viruses infecting people at the start of a large outbreak would be slightly different than those infecting people months later.
Although the Texas and Utah outbreaks are caused by the same strain, Oakeson said, “more fine-grained details are leading us to believe they aren’t super closely related.” To learn just how different they are from each other, scientists are comparing them with measles virus genomes from other states and countries.
Ideally scientists could pair genetic studies with shoe-leather investigations into how each outbreak started. However, many investigations have come up dry because the first people infected haven’t sought care or contacted health departments. As in West Texas, the outbreak in Utah and Arizona is concentrated in close-knit, undervaccinated communities that are leery of government authorities and mainstream medicine.
Researchers are also trying to learn how many measles cases have gone undetected. “Confirmed cases require testing, and in some communities, there’s a cost to going to the hospital to get tested: a tank of gas, finding a babysitter, missing work,” Andrew Pavia, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Utah, said. “If your kid has a measles rash but isn’t very sick, why would you bother?”
Subtle Surveillance
Pavia is part of a nationwide outbreak surveillance network led by the CDC. A straightforward way to figure out how large an outbreak is would be through surveys, but that’s complicated when communities don’t trust public health workers.
“In a collaborative setting, we could administer questionnaires asking if anyone in a household had a rash and other measles symptoms,” Pavia said, “but the same issues that make it difficult to get people to quarantine and vaccinate make this hard.”
Instead, Pavia and other researchers are analyzing genomes. A lot of variation suggests an outbreak spread for weeks or months before it was detected, infecting many more people than known.
A less intrusive mode of surveillance is through wastewater. This year, the CDC and state health departments have launched efforts to test sewage from households and buildings for measles viruses that infected people shed. A study in Texas found that this could function as an early warning system, alerting public health authorities to an outbreak before people show up in hospitals.
The quiet research of CDC scientists stands in stark contrast to its dearth of public-facing actions. The CDC hasn’t held a single press briefing on measles since President Donald Trump took office, and its last publication on measles in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report was in April.
Rather than act fast to limit the size of the Texas outbreak, the Trump administration impeded the CDC’s ability to communicate quickly with Texas officials and slowed the release of federal emergency funds, according to investigations by KFF Health News. Meanwhile Kennedy broadcast mixed messages on vaccines and touted unproven treatments.
Daskalakis said that as the outbreak in Texas worsened, his CDC team was met by silence when they asked to brief Kennedy and other HHS officials.
“Objectively they weren’t helping with the Texas outbreak, so if we lose elimination, maybe they’ll say, ‘Who cares,’” Daskalakis said.
Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy responded strongly to the Texas outbreak by directing the CDC to help provide measles vaccines and medications to communities, expediting measles testing, and advising doctors and health officials. The U.S. retains its elimination status because there’s no evidence of continuous transmission for 12 months, he added.
“Preliminary genomic analysis suggests the Utah and Arizona cases are not directly linked to Texas,” the CDC’s acting director, Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O’Neill, wrote on the social platform X.
Given Kennedy’s distortions of data on vitamin A, Tylenol, and autism, Daskalakis said the Trump administration may insist that outbreaks aren’t linked or that PAHO is wrong.
“It will be quite a stain on the Kennedy regime if he is the health secretary in the year we lose elimination status,” he said. “I think they will do everything they can to cast doubt on the scientific findings, even if it means throwing scientists under the bus.”

They are part of a major project meant to build up the renewable energy supplies in Rhode Island and Connecticut eventually powering 350,000 homes.
It was about 80% completed when the Trump administration abruptly paused its construction. Although work has now resumed, one tradesman working on wind infrastructure projects is worried about the future of the industry.
Stories From The States is a new weekly podcast exploring how people and communities across America are being affected by the drastic and rapid changes at the federal level. Episode 5 dives into one project that suffered a blow in Trump’s war on offshore wind as a renewable energy source.


Senior Reporter Nancy Lavin from the Rhode Island Current talks to host States Newsroom Publisher and CEO Chris Fitzsimon about what led to the Revolution Wind project being suspended and the politics surrounding renewable energy efforts – who is lining up for and against these projects.We’ll also chat with Nick Reynolds, a member of Local 195 of District Council 11, a local painters’ union, who worked on the project.

This is Stories From The States. I’m Chris Fitzsimon. Here at States Newsroom, we know there’s a lot going on around the country every week, in every state. This week, we’re talking wind turbines, specifically the ones you’d see over big bodies of water to help generate power. The Trump administration isn’t a big fan, apparently, of the renewable energy resource. They’ve canceled millions in federal funding to support wind infrastructure, but states like Connecticut and Rhode Island are still investing in renewable energy. One of their major collaborative projects called Revolution Wind was 80% completed, and developers thought they were in the clear, but the Trump administration abruptly paused the project in August, which was met, as you’d imagine, with a mix of emotions.
Nick Reynolds  
Just so uncertain. It’s not a great feeling when we rely on these jobs and these projects to feed ourselves.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Today, we’re heading over to the New England coast to chat with a tradesman who worked on the Revolution Wind project, but first we’ll talk to a Rhode Island reporter covering the situation.
Chris Fitzsimon  
The Revolution Wind project was already 80% finished, but was abruptly paused by the federal government. In response, the developers of the project filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. Now, construction is back on after a DC judge issued a preliminary injunction. To give us a rundown about what’s going on along the New England coastline is Nancy Lavin, she’s a senior reporter at the Rhode Island Current. Nancy, thanks for being here. 
Nancy Lavin
Thank you for having me. 
Chris Fitzsimon  
Well, Nancy, give us some background. Let’s try to understand what’s actually happening. Tell us about this Revolution Wind project.
Nancy Lavin
Yeah, so like many of the offshore wind projects that are, we’re seeing under construction or under development up and down the coast, this has been in the works for years. It is a joint project from Orsted, which is a big Danish renewable energy company and another consortium of overseas development companies under the sort of umbrella of Skyborn Renewables. 65 turbines. It’s about 15 miles south of Rhode Island, somewhat close to the Block Island Wind Farm, which everyone in Rhode Island will be the first to tell you, was the first in the country, offshore wind farm. That’s only five. However, this is 65 and once it’s up and running, at its peak, it would generate enough electricity to power 350,000 homes. Rhode Island and Connecticut are the two states that have already, since 2019 been under contract to buy power from this when it is completed. The federal review process, it takes many years. There’s a lease, then there’s scrutiny about environment, construction, impact on fisheries, impact on vessels traveling, marine safety. Rhode Island is also unique in that we have our own coastal Regulatory Council that also gets to weigh in on any offshore wind projects within 30 miles of our state coastline, even though this process is largely governed by the federal government. So all of that was done. They got their final approval in November 2023. 1000 labor workers under unions in Rhode Island have been working on the projects. There’s been a lot of investment in ports in Rhode Island and Connecticut to sort of create the equipment that will lift these massive, you know, skyscraper turbines into the air and the water. There’s all this workforce training that’s been going on to train these specialty technicians and how to construct and maintain and operate these turbines. And then all of a sudden, August, Friday afternoon ruined my weekend. 
Chris Fitzsimon 
Well, it probably ruined a lot of people’s weekend. 
Nancy Lavin
Yeah, seriously, the Trump administration comes out with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is the agency that really oversees offshore wind permits, sends a letter to the developer of the project, saying, ‘Stop, halt national security’ and not a lot more detail.
Chris Fitzsimon
OK, to help us understand this project was what roughly 80, more than 80% finished already when it was stopped?
Nancy Lavin
Yeah, so they had 45 of the 65 turbines built the two sort of underseas cables that connect the wind turbines to the substations on land where they, you know, connect to the electrical grid were also almost complete, as well as these two pair of substations where the cables sort of all connect. The exact completion date. It was supposed to be up and running about a year from now, but the actual construction was, you know, almost done. There were about a dozen workers actually out at sea and stuck there, just kind of like milling around for two weeks and then before they eventually went back and docked in Connecticut, because they were like, what do we do?
Chris Fitzsimon
What was the reaction when this unexpected work stoppage happened at this point?
Nancy Lavin
Distress, outrage, uncertainty, a mix of reactions, and I think it sort of varied depending. And I will say there was also some celebration, because even though Rhode Island is well known as a Democratic stronghold, we also have a very strong commercial fishing industry. And I have seen covering offshore wind development, particularly at the state level, through the state coastal regulatory process over the last five years, many of the commercial fishermen are strongly opposed to these wind projects. They worry about their safety. They worry about the loss of species. And to be fair, they are recording fewer landings. They are less able to catch the species that they are trying to catch, which is, you know, squid, Atlantic cod. A lot of the things that Rhode Island is known for in the area, however, sort of what the federal government and what most scientists and researchers have said in their very extensive environmental reviews is that’s not necessarily isolated to offshore wind. That’s because of climate change and migration patterns and other disruptions and commercial activity in the water. So those the fishermen, were celebrating. Everyone else, labor leaders, environmental advocates, state officials, our congressional delegation. Not happy.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Just to be clear, folks who had reservations about this or who were opposed, I assume, had chance to speak in this. This was you mentioned. This was a long process. It’s been several years. It went through a lot of hoops. So all sides that seems like would have had a chance to have been heard before now.
Nancy Lavin
Now, yes, although they would argue that the process, you know, has been kind of flawed and rigged from the start. So the interesting thing is, there’s a big overlap in Rhode Island, and I think in other coastal states, between sort of the fishing opposition and right wing backed anti renewable energy groups. So there’s actually this group in Rhode Island called Green Oceans, which, by its name and by its branding on its website, you think is an environmental group. It’s not. It was started by a group of residents in one of the coastal towns in Rhode Island opposed to offshore wind. They are funded by a lot of national right wing conservative groups, and are now actually involved in these federal court cases, which is interesting that they’ve been granted permission to sort of intervene in federal cases in Rhode Island and DC, but perpetuating a lot of misinformation, and really disinformation about offshore wind, killing whales. It certainly didn’t help that another wind project in Massachusetts, Vineyard Wind, over the summer, one of the turbine blades fell off into the water, which was determined to be a manufacturing error. But, you know, certainly solidified all every fear and every concern about the safety of these projects overall, in the mind of detractors. 
Chris Fitzsimon  
What was the reaction to unions, labor officials and folks who are worried about jobs?
Nancy Lavin
Yeah, they were not happy. So you know, our in Rhode Island, like many states, big labor state, the labor organizations, have a lot of influence also in state politics, and labor leaders and state officials have really worked over the last four years to kind of create this quote, unquote, blue economy in Rhode Island, which is not just about the actual projects being built next to Rhode Island that we’re buying power from, but even projects, you know, in New York and New Jersey, that our ports now have this specialty equipment to, like, lay the turbines upright and ship them out to sea, and we have all of these specialized workers who know how to operate them, and who know how to maintain them, and who are taking these specialty apprenticeship programs that have been created in Rhode Island. There was about 1200 union jobs that have already worked on this particular project. And you know, there were rotations going out to sea every two weeks in the wake of the stop work order, some of those laborers, depending on which trades they were in, have actually since taken other jobs because they were like, we can’t just sit here and sit by the phone waiting to see what the federal administration is going to do. So a lot on the line. 
Chris Fitzsimon
I just want to go back to something you said earlier this just to show how massive a project this is. 350,000 homes will eventually be able to be powered by this project?
Nancy Lavin
Yes, and both Rhode Island and Connecticut have not just goals but mandates around decarbonization. So in Rhode Island, we, under state law that was passed a few years ago, have to create or buy credits to offset 100% of our electricity use by 2033 this project was already baked into all of the calculations about our ability to reach that because everyone assumed it was a done deal. And this is, you know, our only major off scale wind project. Things like solar, things like geothermal, are like starting to become more popular, but really do not sort of make the impact that a massive offshore wind farm does. Rhode Island also has a mandate by 2050 to hit zero net carbon emissions. And starting, I believe by 2030 people in the state can sue if we don’t meet these incremental benchmarks of reducing our carbon emissions X percent below the baseline, which is a 1990 level baseline. And again, Revolution Wind was already baked into all of our assumptions about whether we’re going to be able to hit these incremental mandates.
Chris Fitzsimon
You mentioned that one of the points of opposition from the Trump administration was national security, which seems odd. Do we know what that means? What’s the national security risk in this project?
Nancy Lavin
So the initial letter really gave very little detail. It referred back to this memo that this executive order that Trump signed on his first day in office, which made pretty clear, we’re pausing reviews of all wind projects that are not yet fully permanent, because we want to review them against national security and environmental and energy concerns. No one thought revolution wind was really at risk because it had already been permitted and was like mostly built, and then eight months later, the developers get this letter saying, hey, national security, remember this executive order from eight months ago? This is why the letter was two pages, offered very little detail. However, the developers and then the attorneys general for Rhode Island and Connecticut have since sued the Trump administration and in the developers lawsuit, which is was filed in DC and has been sort of playing out the process a little bit faster. Filings from the Justice Department on behalf of the Trump administration offer a little bit more explanation into how they’re justifying this, which is essentially their argument. And the testimony from federal environmental regulators suggest that even though this project got final approval in November 2023 it wasn’t totally final, because according to these federal regulators, they gave the developers a little leeway on some of these additional pieces that were needed, including some details about how building and operation of the wind project would interfere with Department of Defense, or War Department, as it is now being called, at least in these legal documents and by the administration, with Department of Defense boats and with the electromagnetic waves from and frequencies From the turbines underwater, how that would interfere with defense signals. The other piece that they claim was sort of still under review was this detail about how the project would interact with NOAA’s ability to do research into fisheries in the areas. And they say these things weren’t turned in. ‘We asked for them. We asked for them, and then finally we issued a stop work order’. The developers, in response, filed their own, you know, set of responses, which say we’ve been meeting with you guys every two weeks since the Trump administration took office. They say they met with the various agencies two days before the stop work order was issued. None of this was ever said, According to the developers in their testimony.
Chris Fitzsimon
Just to be clear, from the timeline that you gave us, this project sort of had the go ahead or wasn’t, at least wasn’t objected to the first time President Trump was in office, so the Trump administration at some point signed off on it, or at least didn’t stop this project.
Nancy Lavin
Yes, it was actually under the first Trump administration that the Pentagon gave some preliminary sign off on the defense piece of it, ironically.
Chris Fitzsimon  
What do we think changed their mind about this project?
Nancy Lavin
It’s really not super clear, still. You know, they’re offering this additional detail, but the they actually include in the exhibits in the court case, copy of the agreement between the developers and the Department of Defense, and the agreement never says there are these outstanding like written documentations that you need to turn in. It just says you agree, and we agree. You’re going to let us know if anything comes up, and if you change the configuration of the turbines, or the number of the turbines, or anything like that.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Okay, with all that background, where are we? What happens now?
Nancy Lavin
Work has resumed. Our governor and the Connecticut governor had a big sort of parade, if you will, in New London, Connecticut, which is where some of the vessels have been docked, sort of celebrating. Work is back. We’re back on however, if the administration’s record on all of these other state lawsuits on everything from research funding to vaccines to immigration policy, or any indication there will be a challenge to a higher court, and this was actually only in one of the cases that this judge in DC ruled that the work can continue. So still pending, although it obviously would likely to concur with this ruling, is the case in Rhode Island by the attorneys general, which is also arguing that the work should be able to resume.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Well, Nancy, thanks for being with us and helping us understand what’s at stake here. We appreciate your time. 
Nancy Lavin
Thank you for having me.
Chris Fitzsimon 
As of this recording, construction on the revolution wind project is still in progress. However, Rhode Island’s second attempt to build more wind turbines along their coast has not been as successful, according to reporting from the Rhode Island Current a contract between Rhode Island Energy and South Coast Wind fell through. That project would have provided enough electricity to power 125,000 homes. A spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy mentioned the federal uncertainty around the offshore wind industry was a reason why contract negotiations were cut. The project is getting the attention of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that recently won a case to let them reconsider South Coast Winds federal permits, which were already approved by the Biden administration just last year. Now it’s uncertain if or when the South Coast wind project will happen. A tradesman working on wind infrastructure is worried that might be what the future of all these projects could be. In a moment, we’ll chat with Nick Reynolds, he worked on the Revolution Wind project. We’ll be right back.

Chris Fitzsimon
Imagine this. You go through extensive training to be part of the construction of an offshore wind project, and then it abruptly stops, as we heard Rhode Island current reporter Nancy Lavin say it caused a lot of distress, outrage and uncertainty for many folks working on the Revolution Wind project, including Nick Reynolds. He’s a member of Local 195, of District Council 11, a local painters union, and he joins us now, Nick, thanks for being here. Tell us a little bit about your work. First, what is your work like? 
Nick Reynolds
Yeah, so the trade is industrial painting. So I prep and paint steel, anything, steel, bridges, tanks, wind turbines, wastewater treatment plants, infrastructure.
Chris Fitzsimon 
What is a typical day like? How do you paint a wind turbine? It must not be easy. 
Nick Reynolds
Yeah. So most of the work that I’ve done has been out of band lifts. Those are the machines that you see when you see like new construction of buildings. Those, a lot of times they’re like big orange machines, four wheels with a basket that range anywhere from 40 feet to 160 feet.
Chris Fitzsimon 
So you go up and you go up in the basket? 
Nick Reynolds
Yeah, so our trade performs, like a lot of related work, like it’s not just painting, like we do rigging. So like a lot of times to access repairs on a bridge, for example, we will build scaffolding. One of the types of scaffolding is called Quick deck. It hangs down from chains on the bridge, and then you basically build steel squares that are held together with pins. And it’s modular, so you put up one square, you load the material, and build out until the entire bottom of the bridge is covered, and that’s the access for the repairs.
Chris Fitzsimon
What? What are you thinking when you’re up, when you’re up in that basket?
Nick Reynolds
I remember what I thought when I first started was, ‘I don’t know if I can do this’, 
Chris Fitzsimon
I bet. 
Nick Reynolds
But I think everyone’s scared to fall. But I think over time, you gain confidence on the tools and with the equipment, and it’s just second nature to me at this point. It’s just another day. 
Chris Fitzsimon 
Yeah how long have you been on the Revolution Wind project?
Nick Reynolds
Between all the wind projects, I’ve been working on and off since 2022 so I worked on Revolution, right now I’m working on Sunrise Wind but they’re both in the same facility in the port of Providence, in the hub that, or said, built to help facilitate this work.
Chris Fitzsimon
What was the feeling, or what did you think when you first heard that the Trump administration at some point had paused a revolution wind project?
Nick Reynolds
Initial thoughts were, oh, my God. You know, hopefully there will be, there will be work for me on Monday, because that was all up in the air. There’s no question that those actions have affected, you know, union work hours for not only me and other painters, but all the trades and all the industries that are supporting these projects as well.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Were your co workers feeling the same way? Did you guys talk about it?
Nick Reynolds
Yeah, I mean, there’s, there was so much uncertainty. I remember, like, everyone kind of calling around, and there was like murmuring about work on Monday and then in the future, just so uncertain. It’s not a great feeling when we we rely on these jobs and these projects to feed ourselves.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, and it must, must have been odd. It seems like you would have thought this would have, would have been a job that they would have seen finished. And then all of a sudden to have it screeched to a halt, at least temporarily, it must have been a shock.
Nick Reynolds
Yeah. I mean, I think that we were all under the impression that once all the permitting was done and and it was funded, that there was no legal way to stop the work. So we were a little shocked. And I believe it was cited as like a national security threat was, I just think is absolutely ridiculous. I don’t understand why the Republicans are doing this.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah. 
Nick Reynolds
I don’t 
Chris Fitzsimon
What about when it sort of restarted? What was the feeling in your trades or your union about the fact that people were able to go back to work?
Nick Reynolds
I mean, I speak for myself, I was grateful to go back to work, but I think that we all know the reality now is that the people that have invested in these projects aren’t likely to come back and spend money here again. It wouldn’t make sense, would it? I don’t know, like we have done a lot of training, specialized training, in order to just get on these jobs. So it’s takes the wind out of your sails when you put so much effort towards something like a new industry that’s promising for the future, and then something like that happens, it’s just demotivating to say the least.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, I’ll bet. What kind of training did you have, or specialized training? What did you have to learn to do this job or work on these projects.
Nick Reynolds 
Yeah, so obviously, there’s a maritime aspect offshore work. So there was a grant that was issued by the state and Orsted, also funded it partially for additional first aid training, water rescue training, helicopter training and rope access training.
Chris Fitzsimon
That seems fairly complicated.
Nick Reynolds
Complicated and a huge commitment of time. Yeah.
Chris Fitzsimon
How long have you been in this kind of work?
Nick Reynolds
I’ve been working in construction for about 10 years, and in this particular industry for eight. 
Chris Fitzsimon
What are your thoughts about the future of the industry?
Nick Reynolds
The industry isn’t going anywhere because it’s infrastructure, like my work will be needed in the future, but like wind as a whole, I just, I just can’t imagine people wanting to make an investment in something that someone can just make a decision one day and shut down on a whim.
Chris Fitzsimon 
What would you want people to know? Who you know, they probably just saw the headlines. They might even if they live in, you know, maybe an adjacent state or whatever, and they’ve read about this from the workers perspective, what would you want somebody to know about, what’s happening there, what you guys have gone through and what you’re worried about,
Nick Reynolds  
I think, like maybe a lot of people who have quote, unquote regular jobs or nine to fives, don’t understand that construction work is trying to build the career out of, like many, many temporary projects. So you know, we’re never done. You’re never done looking so to be on a project that has years of work hours that are well funded, and to take that away is is a huge blow to like the working class of Rhode Island and construction workers in general. That’s how we pay for food. That’s how we pay for doctor’s visits, dental visits, glasses, gas car insurance, life. You know, money is the feel for choices, and if we’re not working, we’re pretty limited, to say the least. 
Chris Fitzsimon
What would you do if you weren’t doing this? Do you think? 
Nick Reynolds
If I weren’t doing construction or this? 
Chris Fitzsimon 
Yeah, yeah, 
Nick Reynolds
Starve. I think I’ve tried many things. I might, I might bartend been successful at that in the past, but you know, those jobs don’t really come with health insurance, do they?
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, and they’re not usually union jobs, I’m guessing. 
Nick Reynolds
No, they’re not. They never are. 
Chris Fitzsimon
Well, Nick, we really appreciate what you’re doing up there and and that you took some time to talk to us. Thank you very much.
Nick Reynolds 
I appreciate that you’re interested, it’s a big deal to me.

Coming up shortly, Evening Wrap newsletter writer Danielle Gaines will join us with the top stories she’s looking out for, and with one last thing, we’ll be right back.
Nelle Dunlap
Hi, it’s Nelle Dunlap, product and engineering director at state’s newsroom.

You can subscribe to our work by going to states newsroom.com/subscribe.
Chris Fitzsimon
Well, now it comes to my favorite time of every week, talking to Danielle Gaines, the author of the State’s Newsroom Evening Wrap newsletter. Danielle, how are you? 
Danielle Gaines
Hello, I’m good. How are you good? 
Chris Fitzsimon
Tell us something that caught your eye this week?
Danielle Gaines
Yeah, we had a couple of stories, kind of both centering on resident responses to immigration enforcement across the country. And so we had this story out of Oregon, where there’s now widespread opposition to possible federal government plans to build a detention center at an airport hangar in this like relatively small Central Coast town, residents and officials actually pieced it all together. So their Coast Guard rescue helicopter was moved 70 miles away. A defense contractor looked into leasing land next to the airport. Private companies began putting out ads for detention correctional officers. And so since they put it all together, there have now been, like multiple lawsuits, and state and local and federal lawmakers have all mobilized kind of against this plan. So I found that very interesting. And then in Tennessee, where the Memphis Safe Task Force is operating in a similar vein, there is this rapid response group that was set up V 901, and they report on immigration activities. They started during the first Trump administration. They say they now receive more than 100 calls a day, and our story included vivid details from just one example. So an alert went out about a woman hiding in a closet with her twin toddlers. She didn’t know what to do as agents were surrounding her home, a volunteer rushed to the scene and found a tow truck blocking the street, blaring the song, “Bad Boys”. 
Chris Fitzsimon
Oh my god. 
Danielle Gaines
Agents had thrown chemical agents into the house, and the family was forced out and through volunteers, they’re at least covering these stories and spreading information.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, it’s really interesting. It feels like it’s happening more and more communities are responding and learning from what happened in the previous communities.
Danielle Gaines
Yeah, and that’s really how people are learning how to move around safely in some cases.
Chris Fitzsimon
All right, give us something that’s coming up. What are you looking to see?
Danielle Gaines
You know, I’m looking out. Our friends at Stateline this week had a story about the Justice Department suing six more states for detailed information about their voter rolls. That means that the Justice Department has now sued a dozen states for this information. The first round of lawsuits was filed in September. They are all aimed at democratic or purple states that won’t turn over unredacted copies of the lists, so they’re looking for driver’s license numbers, partial social security numbers. The Trump administration says this is for election integrity efforts, and democratic officials are concerned about privacy issues and that this will be part of an immigration verification tool.
Chris Fitzsimon 
It feels like, feels like half the news these days is some version of responding to the new immigration crackdown.
Danielle Gaines
Yeah, and so they’re the six states were sued this week, but then also this week, Colorado, which is facing off with the Trump administration on a lot of different fronts, refused to turn over their information once again. So they also acknowledged they may be part of another future lawsuit.
Chris Fitzsimon
OK, Danielle, now that I think the moment we’ve all been waiting for, what is one last thing for this week?
Danielle Gaines
Yeah, it’s always hard to pick, and I love just having a little bit of a light spot when we’re reading all the news. So in South Dakota, near Nebraska, there is a new display going up. It’s called firehenge, and it is right off of I-90. So firehenge is a ring of 10 ton fire trucks on their like back end raised up to the sky, leaning against each other, resembling Stonehenge from England. And it is actually a promotion for a firehouse, but it is still something to behold. Looks very interesting. And if you don’t know, this is very near to carhenge, which is already a thing in Nebraska. And actually the city of Alliance, Nebraska manages it. They said that they’re not really threatened by firehenge coming up nearby. And so it was just kind of a fun story from the Nebraska Examiner looking at, like, kind of the competition between these two states for these two, like quirky roadside attractions.
Chris Fitzsimon
That is fascinating, carhenge and firehenge,
Danielle Gaines
Yes, and they are far from the only henges, by the way. So as part of firehenge, there is doghenge, which is a bunch of fire hydrants. And then there’s a foamhenge in Virginia, truckhenge, which is vintage farm trucks in Topeka, Kansas, phonehenge in South Carolina, which is phone booths. And if you go and read our story, we also have like henges of the past, things that just didn’t quite have staying power.
Chris Fitzsimon
Well, we now are up to date on henges. Thank you.
Danielle Gaines
Yes, very interesting. And we’ve got photos too, so you should go look at them.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, definitely check that out. Thank you very much, Danielle. 
Danielle Gaines

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-06 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,What civil rights action looks like 70 years after the Montgomery Bus Boycott,"Kim Chandler and Jaylen Green, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/06/70-years-after-montgomery-bus-boycott/,"Black residents' boycott of city buses in Montgomery, Alabama, started 70 years ago and lasted more than one year. It was widely considered the beginning of the modern Civil Rights Movement.","MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Doris Crenshaw was 12 years old on Dec. 5, 1955, when she and her sister eagerly rushed door to door in their neighborhood, distributing flyers prepared by activists planning a boycott of city buses in Montgomery, Alabama.
“Don’t ride the bus to work, to town, to school or any place on Monday,” the flyers read, urging people to attend a mass meeting that evening.
There was a sense of urgency. Days earlier, Rosa Parks, the secretary of the local NAACP chapter, had been the latest Black person arrested for refusing to give up a bus seat to a white passenger on the segregated buses. For 381 days, an estimated 40,000 Black residents stayed off city buses — opting to walk, ride in car pools or take Black-owned cabs — until a legal challenge struck down bus-segregation laws.

“In this city there was a groundswell of a need to do something about what was going on in the buses, because a lot of people were arrested,” recalled Crenshaw, now 82.
Friday marked the 70th anniversary of the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and many of the boycott organizers’ descendants, including those of late civil rights icons the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy Sr., planned to reunite in the Alabama city where it all started. Widely considered the beginning of the modern Civil Rights Movement, the bus boycott demonstrated the power of sustained nonviolent protest and economic pressure that continues to provide a model for the activism today.
A group of national organizers encouraged people to avoid the temptation of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, aiming the action at corporations like Target and Amazon over their stance of diversity initiatives and financial backing of the Trump administration.
“Any time there can be a strategic and organized response to corporate behavior or exclusionary policy, communities should be free to identify the best approach to address the harm that’s being created,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a phone interview Thursday.
“Boycotting is one tool in the toolbox. At the NAACP, we call it selective buying campaigns,” said Johnson, who lives in Jackson, Mississippi.
Boycott history
Parks’ Dec. 1, 1955, arrest was the final catalyst for the boycott that had been quietly discussed by some activists in Alabama’s capital city. The seats at the front of the city buses were reserved for white people. Black passengers were forced to sit in the back and were expected to give up their seats if the white section became full.
Contrary to the story that is often told, Parks, who died in 2005, wrote that she was not particularly tired from work that day when she took a stand by keeping her seat.
“No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in,” Parks wrote in her autobiography.
Parks was a beloved figure in the town, Crenshaw recalled. She led the NAACP Youth Council and Crenshaw and other members would meet at the Parks’ apartment each week.

Pulling off the boycott for more than a year took an extreme amount of dedication and discipline, Crenshaw recalled.
“We walked, and we kept walking,” said Crenshaw, who walked across town to school each day. “We never got back on those buses.”
Crenshaw went on to a lifetime of civil rights activism. She organized National Council of Negro Women chapters as a southern field representative and was a member of President Jimmy Carter’s domestic policy staff, focused on small and minority business issues. She founded The Southern Youth Leadership Development Institute, mentoring young people as Parks once did for her.
“Everywhere you go, people say they are inspired by Mrs. Parks and by what happened with the Montgomery Bus Boycott,” Crenshaw said.
Boycotting in the spirit of Montgomery
While the specific methods have changed, the underlying goal of leveraging the economic power of the community to drive social and policy change remains the same, said Deborah Scott, the CEO of Georgia Stand-Up. The organization is focused on economic and social justice issues and emphasizes engaging and developing the next generation of activists and leaders.
Scott said she was a teenager when she arrived in Atlanta more than 30 years ago to begin organizing with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference around the anti-apartheid movement. She worked to free South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela and to establish a holiday honoring King.

She learned from the Rev. James Orange, the late prominent civil rights activist and King assistant, who taught her the value of preparing young people to work for however long it takes to enact change.
She remembers some of the important questions he posed: “What are you going to do after you tweeted, after you put the word out to show up? What are you going to say when you get to the microphone? What are you going to do and how will you conduct yourself in these situations?”
Just like the original Montgomery boycott, which sought access to affordable, non-discriminatory transportation by bringing large groups of people together to drive change, the success of boycotts after it required an unshakeable sense of unity.
“Everything is about relationships, but relationship organizing is the thing that is the same,” she said.
With widespread use of social media platforms, today’s boycotts look different. Scott said the biggest change in boycotting with the newer generation is the focus on using consumer purchasing power to pressure companies to change their policies or practices.
“We’re encouraging people to really dig deep about where they want to spend their dollars,” Scott said.
Next generation takes action
Madison Pugh, at 13, is about the same age that Crenshaw was when she became involved in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The eighth grader decided with her grandmother not to shop at Target after the retailing giant announced it was phasing out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
She said the retailer’s decision felt like a betrayal and a step backward.
Living in Montgomery, Pugh is growing up surrounded by the history of the civil rights movement that transpired decades before she was born. The stories from Crenshaw and others are more than just inspiring, she said.

“It’s saddening to the heart to know that a whole group of people weren’t allowed to go somewhere and have an education or be treated as humans because they were a different skin color,” Pugh said. “It definitely lets me know that the job will never be finished and you have to keep pushing.”
Scott said one of her goals is to help people see the connection between the activism of the past and today.
“The movement and the Civil Rights Movement didn’t just happen back then,” Scott said. “It’s still happening now.”

This time, he said a former political opponent (Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota) of his was “seriously r*******.” He used the same word about a year ago, and again before that. I know a lot of you will be more offended at me for simply pointing that […]","A Thanksgiving Day message posted by President Donald J. Trump in 2025 to his Truth Social Media platform in which he several accusations, including that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is ""seriously retarded."" (Screenshot)Our president just used an ableist slur, again. This time, he said a former political opponent (Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota) of his was “seriously r*******.” 
He used the same word about a year ago, and again before that. I know a lot of you will be more offended at me for simply pointing that out than you are at what he said. You will claim I am trying to be the PC police and stop people from saying what they want. But I want to be clear: I’m not policing anyone’s speech here. He can use the R-word all he wants and no one, especially little-ol’-me,  is going to stop that. You should also feel free to use the R-word all you want; I certainly use it as often as I want and feel you should have that same right. 
The amount I like using the R-word is never. Did I use it when I was a kid? Absolutely, but I’m a middle-aged, Gen-X guy, and almost nothing about my childhood should be considered relevant anymore except perhaps as source material for streaming shows and fashion.  But today, and for the last 30 or so years, I haven’t used the word because it’s hateful and using the word does not reflect what I am or want to become. 
Political appeals to ableism,  whether explicit or in more subtle dog-whistles,  perpetuate stereotypes about people with disabilities being unfit to contribute to public discourse, run for office, and occupy leadership positions in our society. To be clear, President Donald Trump is not the only politician to do this, he just is the most recent. Lest you think this is a leftist hit job; I find Former President Obama’s jab at President Trump last year, suggesting he wears diapers, repulsive and irrelevant to whether anyone should vote for him. The choice of any politician to use words that hurt people with disabilities devalues disabled people as humans and as voters. 
Today, and historically, labeling a political opponent as disabled is only ever done to say that person is bad or unqualified. Disability is never used to describe a candidate’s strengths and deep knowledge of the experiences of the 29% of Montanans with disabilities and the 31% with mental illness. People only use the R-word, joke about incontinence, or label their opponent as “demented,” “insane,” or “crazy” to devalue them, and they only do that because in their hearts they feel no common humanity with people who have those disabilities and thus see no value in the lives of people with disabilities. That may sound harsh, you may feel a twinge of defensiveness if you’ve used words like this recently, but I will tell you that every time disability is used as a weapon against a specific person, it is simultaneously used as a weapon to hurt members of the disability community at large and those of us with disabilities see it and feel it.  
So you can disagree all you want, but know you won’t change what it feels like for me and other people with disabilities when we hear these attacks on our existence.  For decades, individuals with disabilities and disability groups made efforts to stop the use of ableist language. And they have made real progress.  Professional groups started abandoning ableist language and even pop culture looked to start respecting people with disabilities more. The culmination of rejecting ableist language came in 2010 with the passage of Rosa’s Law which requires “intellectual disability” replace the R-word in federal law. But ever since, I have felt the pendulum swing back. 
Disability Rights Montana asks all of Montana to consider how they use language. We use language both in the sending and receiving of words, so it starts with the words you say but it also includes the way we hear the words used by others. Does suggesting or hinting that a political opponent is “mentally unfit,” or is incontinent excite you to think worse of that opponent and be more supportive of your team? 
Go one step deeper. 
Is it that you really think the person has that disability and it truly prevents rational decision making on their part, or do you just really dislike the decisions that person makes and it feels like an emotionally satisfying way to minimize them for pursuing a path you find repugnant? Do you think incontinence has anything to do with foreign or domestic policy decision making? Or do you think it makes the target of the attack look weak and generally incompetent? 
I have dyslexia, a heart condition and mental illness and I’m an incredibly effective advocate and leader. I know strong, highly competent people at the peak of their fields who cannot control their bladders or bowels. I know incredibly insightful, smart, caring, and powerful leaders who have intellectual disabilities. I know cruel, flippant, disrespectful geniuses who would make horrible leaders. Don’t use me and my community as your lazy way of saying something is poorly thought out or doesn’t conform to your moral view of the world. Find better words like bad, ridiculous, thoughtless, mean-spirited, unsupported, reckless, etc.
I would love to see a day when candidates for office can talk about their disabilities with pride and connect as peers with the 29% of Montanans with disabilities and 31% with mental illness, ready to offer their lived experiences as credentials for public service. This would be no different than the person running for office as a small business owner saying they understand what we need to make our communities work better for entrepreneurs, or a teacher running on their experience in the classroom as a strength in building education policy in the legislature. 
Until we have open, proud disabled political leaders, this is my reminder to you that ableist name calling doesn’t just hurt the candidate it is hurled at, it hurts the person slinging those slurs in the eyes of many disabled Montanans, and it hurts the disability community directly because it reminds us and further reinforces in others that we continue to live in a world that does not value disabled people’s contributions to our communities.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump-tweet-Truth-541x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-06 06:57:04.086916

Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, speaks with Republican supporters at the Idaho GOP election night watch party at the Grove Hotel in Boise, Idaho, on Nov. 8, 2022. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Republican Congressman Russ Fulcher is hoping to expand the use of private, short-term health insurance.
Fulcher on Thursday announced the introduction of the Removing Insurance Gaps for Health Treatment (RIGHT) Act of 2025, which would extend the maximum allowance for short-term health plans from four months to up to three years. 
Short-term, limited-duration insurance, known as STLDI, are private insurance plans designed to cover temporary gaps in health coverage. The plans are sometimes less expensive than plans offered through state health insurance marketplace plans, but do not always cover as many services and are not subject to the same consumer protection regulations as those compliant with the Affordable Care Act. 
“Four months is far too short a limit, posing undue stress and uncertainty on Americans who would otherwise be left without coverage,” Fulcher said in a press release. “My bill, the RIGHT Act, expands STLDI plans to a full year, with the option to renew for up to three years. This is a practical, no-cost approach that offers families more choice, control, and flexibility to select the healthcare options that work best for them.”

Insurers offering short term plans can deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions or exclude coverage for those conditions, such as cancer or pregnancy, according to a 2025 analysis by the health policy organization KFF. The analysis also found that “the lowest-cost short-term plan premium for a 40-year-old woman ranges from 6% to 19% higher than the lowest-cost premium for a man.” Regulations under the federal Affordable Care Act, or ACA, prohibit these practices for other types of insurance.  
Short-term plans are sold in 36 states, including Idaho, according to KFF. Plans may be available for three months, with the ability to renew for a total of four months of coverage. 
Federal regulations require short-term insurers to conspicuously notify consumers that the plans are not “comprehensive coverage.” These regulations were crafted in response to misleading marketing and deceptive sales tactics, KFF said. 
The Idaho Department of Insurance in 2019 issued two notices regarding short-term health plans: one warned Idahoans of robocall scams that come “from telemarketing centers and give incomplete information, trying to pass off very limited coverage as comprehensive health insurance,” and the other was a cease and desist letter to a short-term health care insurer soliciting in Idaho that was not licensed to do so. 
The KFF analysis found that the lowest cost short-term plans could cost two-thirds or less than the lowest-cost, unsubsidized Bronze plans sold on the ACA marketplace in the same area. However, the analysis found that the federal premium tax credits, which subsidize marketplace health insurance premium costs, resulted in similarly priced or some cheaper marketplace plans. 
Fulcher introduced the health care bill the same month the enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire, which may cause significant increases in health insurance costs for some.  
In Idaho, the enhanced credits reduced average monthly premiums by more than $400, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The enhanced credits are set to expire at the end of December without congressional action.

(Courtesy of City of Omaha Parks and Recreation)OMAHA — Mayor John Ewing Jr. sees only public good coming from a proposed arrangement to put a major North Omaha city park under the management of a local philanthropic group that already has invested in Miller Park.
Former State Sen. Justin Wayne, however, took to social media to characterize the move as a “quid pro quo” that would be bad for North Omahans.
“So we’re really doing this? A $40 million check gets you your own ‘public park’ in a private trust?” wrote Wayne, a lawyer who is also running for Douglas County District Court clerk.

He continued, “Before Omaha starts auctioning off the commons, let’s talk about what actually happens when cities privatize parks — because the track record is trash.”
The back and forth sets the stage for a proposed arrangement, yet to be approved by the Omaha City Council, between the City of Omaha and Miller Park Trust. Behind the trust is the Lozier Foundation, which has been identified as the buyer of $40 million in housing bonds from the city to accelerate affordable housing development.
Ewing said he had not talked directly to Wayne as of Friday afternoon, but he pushed back on any notion that residents or taxpayers would lose. He said the city would maintain ownership of the 80-acre park and landmark three-story pavilion. 
 ‘No strings attached’

He expects access and community engagement to improve under the nonprofit trust, which would pay for maintenance and programming and allow a stretched city parks department to tend to other duties.
Officials said the City of Omaha under the proposal still would manage the golf course and swimming pool.
Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. (Courtesy of City of Omaha)
“There are no strings attached,” Ewing told the Nebraska Examiner. “They want to be a partner with the city and help us be able to maintain our parks. It will still be a public park available for people to use. It’s not turned over to Lozier or anybody else.”
The trust arrangement, he said, is part of city efforts to improve public spaces and to retain families in the state’s most populous city.
While he wants Miller Park to be the first of more such trust arrangements under his watch, Ewing noted that a similar situation has existed for about five or so years at Lake Cunningham park, led by the Walter Scott Foundation. 
The Lozier Foundation is the family foundation of Allan and Dianne Lozier, which operates independently of the longtime North Omaha-based Lozier manufacturing corporation. Allan was a graduate of Omaha Technical High School and helped grow the Lozier company.
Tre Brashear, chief operating officer, said the trust would be an extension of foundation efforts in North Omaha, which include development of tuition-free Nelson Mandela Elementary and a neighboring early childhood learning center.
Brashear said Lozier Foundation likely would hire experts from the Cunningham trust to provide initial guidance and transition to a free-standing organization with a staff.
“They get to be good partners with the City of Omaha and help us as we look at being a great city for the people of Omaha — that simple,” said Ewing, a North Omaha native.
 Park purpose rewritten?

Wayne, known in the Legislature as a watchdog for his district, said he sees a different scenario brewing. He contended that “the same ugly pattern” turns up where such a model has been tried.
“Public access disappears. The park may still look public, but suddenly the rules change. Hours change. People get nudged out — especially the people who used it the most,” he wrote. 
He told Facebook followers that maintenance drops overtime in such stewardship arrangements. 
“The purpose of the park gets rewritten. It stops serving the community and starts serving development interests, investors or political branding. The neighborhood loses a civic space and gets a marketing asset instead,” he wrote.
Wayne expects “wealthy donors” to gain influence and, eventually, families to be displaced.
Former State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha. Aug. 17, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Jacqueline Morrison, Omaha’s senior director of economic development, expects the trust to respond more efficiently to community concerns including park lighting, bathroom and other maintenance.
She said the trust would be responsible for mowing, snow removal, picking up trash and activating the pavilion and park by organizing concerts, youth programming, yoga or other events.
Morrison characterized feedback at a “stakeholder” meeting Thursday for park users as positive. Another is scheduled for 10 a.m. Dec. 13 at Nelson Mandela Elementary, 6313 N. 30th St. Park users are asked to provide feedback via a community survey.
Morrison pointed to the The Riverfront park system as a successful public-private partnership, as well as the Cunningham Lake park, which the mayor said has seen millions of dollars in improvements under its trust arrangement.
 ‘Crown jewel’ 

Wayne, in a follow-up interview, said Lozier has been a “great partner” for the community, but he sees the trust arrangement as putting too much control in a private entity. 
He believed Lozier could provide additional funds to improve maintenance and programming without “taking over the park.”
Brashear said the trust’s separate staff, schedule and pay scale would allow it to provide intense focus on Miller Park.
He said the Lozier Foundation, in partnership with the City Parks Department and other donors, has previously helped update Miller Park with amenities such as a new fountain, splash pad, soccer wall and rebuilt pavilion.
“It is a wonderful crown jewel park … and we wanted it to be reflective of that,” he said.
Brashear sees “no economic return” to the foundation and called the trust a well-intended move to ensure park vibrancy and “more robust” programming. “We’re not getting anything back from this.” 
He said that the foundation purchased bonds from the city to help boost affordable housing efforts. The bonds pay the foundation 1% interest, Brasher said, “so we didn’t do it because it was a moneymaker.”
The trust contract would be 10 years, with an option to renew, Brashear said.
“We’re doing this because it’s good for the community and neighborhood,” he said. “We’re getting the satisfaction of trying to make the place we live better.”

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)The United States is poised to lose its measles-free status next year. If that happens, the country will enter an era in which outbreaks are common again.
More children would be hospitalized because of this preventable disease. Some would lose their hearing. Some would die.
Measles is also expensive. A new study — not yet published in a scientific journal — estimates that the public health response to outbreaks with only a couple of cases costs about $244,000. When a patient requires hospital care, costs average $58,600 per case. The study’s estimates suggest that an outbreak the size of the one in West Texas earlier this year, with 762 cases and 99 hospitalizations, costs about $12.6 million.
America’s status hinges on whether the country’s main outbreaks this year stemmed from the big one in West Texas that officially began Jan. 20. If these outbreaks are linked, and go on through Jan. 20 of next year, the U.S. will no longer be among nations that have banished the disease.
“A lot of people worked very hard for a very long time to achieve elimination — years of figuring out how to make vaccines available, get good vaccine coverage, and have a rapid response to outbreaks to limit their spread,” said Paul Rota, a microbiologist who recently retired from a nearly 40-year career at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Instead of acting fast to prevent a measles comeback, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine organization before taking the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services, has undermined the ability of public health officials to prevent and contain outbreaks by eroding trust in vaccines. The measles vaccine is safe and effective: Only 4% of more than 1,800 confirmed U.S. cases of measles this year have been in people who had received two doses.
Kennedy has fired experts on the vaccine advisory committee to the CDC and has said, without evidence, that vaccines may cause autism, brain swelling, and death. On Nov. 19, scientific information on a CDC webpage about vaccines and autism was replaced with false claims. Kennedy told The New York Times that he ordered the change.
“Do we want to go back into a prevaccine era where 500 kids die of measles each year?” asked Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC’s national immunization center, who resigned in protest of Kennedy’s actions in August. He and other scientists said the Trump administration appears to be occupied more with downplaying the resurgence of measles than with curbing the disease.
HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that vaccination remains the most effective tool for preventing measles and that the “CDC and state and local health agencies continue to work together to assess transmission patterns and ensure an effective public health response.”

Looking for links
CDC scientists are indeed tracking measles, alongside researchers at health departments and universities. To learn whether outbreaks are linked, they’re looking at the genomes of measles viruses, which contain all their genetic information. Genomic analyses could help reveal the origin of outbreaks and their true size, and alert officials to undetected spread.
Scientists have conducted genomic analyses of HIV, the flu, and covid for years, but it’s new for measles because the virus hasn’t been much of a problem in the U.S. for decades, said Samuel Scarpino, a public health specialist at Northeastern University in Boston. “It’s important to get a surveillance network into place so that we could scale up rapidly if and when we need it,” he said.
“We are working with the CDC and other states to determine whether what we’re seeing is one large outbreak with continued spread from state to state,” said Kelly Oakeson, a genomics researcher at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.
At first glance, the ongoing outbreak in Utah and Arizona, with 258 cases as of Dec. 1, seems linked to the one in Texas because they’re caused by the same strain of measles, D8-9171. But this strain is also spreading throughout Canada and Mexico, which means the outbreaks could have been sparked separately from people infected abroad. If that happened, this technicality could spare the U.S. from losing its status, Rota said. Being measles-free means the virus isn’t circulating in a country continuously year-round.

Canada lost its measles-elimination status in November because authorities couldn’t prove that various outbreaks from the D8-9171 strain were unrelated, said Daniel Salas, executive manager of the comprehensive immunization program at the Pan American Health Organization. The group, which works with the World Health Organization, includes health officials from countries in North, South, and Central America, and the Caribbean. It makes a call on measles elimination based on reports from scientists in the countries it represents.
Early next year, PAHO will hear from U.S. scientists. If their analyses suggest that measles has spread continuously for a year within the U.S., the organization’s director may revoke the country’s status as measles-free.
“We expect countries to be transparent about the information they have,” Salas said. “We will ask questions, like, ‘How did you determine your findings, and did you consider other angles?’”
In anticipation of PAHO’s assessment, Oakeson and other researchers are studying how closely the D8-9171 strains in Utah match others. Instead of looking at only a short snippet of genes that mark the strain, they’re analyzing the entire genome of the measles virus, about 16,000 genetic letters long. Genetic mutations occur naturally over time, and the accumulation of small changes can act like a clock, revealing how much time has ticked by between outbreaks. “This tells us the evolutionary history of samples,” Oakeson said.
For example, if one child directly infects another, the kids will have matching measles viruses. But measles viruses infecting people at the start of a large outbreak would be slightly different than those infecting people months later.
Although the Texas and Utah outbreaks are caused by the same strain, Oakeson said, “more fine-grained details are leading us to believe they aren’t super closely related.” To learn just how different they are from each other, scientists are comparing them with measles virus genomes from other states and countries.
Ideally scientists could pair genetic studies with shoe-leather investigations into how each outbreak started. However, many investigations have come up dry because the first people infected haven’t sought care or contacted health departments. As in West Texas, the outbreak in Utah and Arizona is concentrated in close-knit, undervaccinated communities that are leery of government authorities and mainstream medicine.
Researchers are also trying to learn how many measles cases have gone undetected. “Confirmed cases require testing, and in some communities, there’s a cost to going to the hospital to get tested: a tank of gas, finding a babysitter, missing work,” Andrew Pavia, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Utah, said. “If your kid has a measles rash but isn’t very sick, why would you bother?”
Subtle surveillance
Pavia is part of a nationwide outbreak surveillance network led by the CDC. A straightforward way to figure out how large an outbreak is would be through surveys, but that’s complicated when communities don’t trust public health workers.
“In a collaborative setting, we could administer questionnaires asking if anyone in a household had a rash and other measles symptoms,” Pavia said, “but the same issues that make it difficult to get people to quarantine and vaccinate make this hard.”
Instead, Pavia and other researchers are analyzing genomes. A lot of variation suggests an outbreak spread for weeks or months before it was detected, infecting many more people than known.
A less intrusive mode of surveillance is through wastewater. This year, the CDC and state health departments have launched efforts to test sewage from households and buildings for measles viruses that infected people shed. A study in Texas found that this could function as an early warning system, alerting public health authorities to an outbreak before people show up in hospitals.
The quiet research of CDC scientists stands in stark contrast to its dearth of public-facing actions. The CDC hasn’t held a single press briefing on measles since President Donald Trump took office, and its last publication on measles in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report was in April.
Rather than act fast to limit the size of the Texas outbreak, the Trump administration impeded the CDC’s ability to communicate quickly with Texas officials and slowed the release of federal emergency funds, according to investigations by KFF Health News. Meanwhile, Kennedy broadcast mixed messages on vaccines and touted unproven treatments.
Daskalakis said that as the outbreak in Texas worsened, his CDC team was met by silence when they asked to brief Kennedy and other HHS officials.
“Objectively they weren’t helping with the Texas outbreak, so if we lose elimination, maybe they’ll say, ‘Who cares,’” Daskalakis said.
Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy responded strongly to the Texas outbreak by directing the CDC to help provide measles vaccines and medications to communities, expediting measles testing, and advising doctors and health officials. The U.S. retains its elimination status because there’s no evidence of continuous transmission for 12 months, he added.
“Preliminary genomic analysis suggests the Utah and Arizona cases are not directly linked to Texas,” the CDC’s acting director, Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O’Neill, wrote on the social platform X.
Given Kennedy’s distortions of data on vitamin A, Tylenol, and autism, Daskalakis said the Trump administration may insist that outbreaks aren’t linked or that PAHO is wrong.
“It will be quite a stain on the Kennedy regime if he is the health secretary in the year we lose elimination status,” he said. “I think they will do everything they can to cast doubt on the scientific findings, even if it means throwing scientists under the bus.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A federal court last week rejected a joint attempt by Maine and the U.S. Department of Justice to weaken a previous agreement that required the state to improve services so that children with disabilities no longer had to be separated from their families.
In a statement Friday, a coalition of rights organizations said the ruling “preserves essential protections that ensure children with behavioral-health needs will receive integrated, community-based services rather than face unnecessary institutionalization.”
The settlement agreement stemmed from a September 2024 lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice that alleged the state was failing to meet the needs of students that require behavioral health services and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by separating them from their homes and communities by institutionalizing them or sending them to juvenile detention centers. 
Two months later, the lawsuit was dismissed after the state agreed to implement a robust accountability system with reporting requirements, community outreach and the establishment of an independent watchdog, who would oversee data on state services. Under that initial agreement, the state committed to increasing the availability of community-based behavioral health services through the Maine Department of Health and Human Services so that children would no longer have to be separated from their families. 
Fast forward to this past September when the state and Justice Department — now under the Trump administration — jointly filed a motion to change the agreement, weakening some of those requirements, including removing the independent reviewer position. The parties argued that the changes were minor and thus acceptable since both the plaintiff and defendant were agreeing to the new terms. 
Maine settles with U.S. DOJ over children’s behavioral health services concerns

In response, the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, GLAD Law and Disability Rights Maine intervened, asking the court through an amicus brief to reject the amended agreement.
Judge Stacey Neumann with the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine ruled on Nov. 24 that the state and federal governments had not justified the proposed changes. The requirements were “intrinsic to the case,” she wrote, and essential to protecting the rights of children with disabilities as required by the ADA.
“Indeed, there is no evidence that reducing the frequency of reporting, trainings, and community outreach and removing the Independent Reviewer will do anything to facilitate the State’s compliance with the agreement,” she wrote. “And may in actuality make it harder to ascertain whether compliance is being achieved.”
As of Friday, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services website displayed the modified agreement — not the approved settlement — that makes no mention of the independent reviewer. The department’s implementation plan, released last month, also makes no mention of the stricter requirements that the court determined the state must meet. 
Atlee Reilly, managing attorney at Disability Rights Maine, said it’s clear the department was “operating under the assumption that this was kind of pro forma and that they were just going to push ahead, as if the agreement had already been changed.”
Now that the court declined to approve it, Reilly said he doesn’t know “what that’s going to mean going forward.”
Both DHHS and the Maine Attorney General’s Office declined to comment.
Carol Garvan, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, said that by “denying this motion, the court affirmed that independent, external oversight is essential.” 
“The role of an independent reviewer is critical in ensuring that Maine keeps its promises to children with disabilities and follows through on long-overdue reforms,” she said in a press statement. “A child’s right to live and thrive in their community is a fundamental right that must be continuously defended.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMGP2433-scaled-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-12-06 05:56:25.052993

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) Over the last few days, President Trump launched a vicious, brazen, and hate-filled attack on Somali immigrants — and by extension, on a fundamental ideal of America itself. In a White House Cabinet meeting, he repeatedly referred to Somalis as “garbage” and demanded they be expelled.
“Ilhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage,” he said. “These are people who do nothing but complain…When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let ’em go back to where they came from and fix it.”
Then: “Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country.”
He doubled down later: “We could go one way or the other — and we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.”
These aren’t misremembered paraphrases. These are disregarded human beings, stripped of dignity, reduced to “garbage” in front of the world.
Why this attack is not about policy — but about hate
Trump’s tirade is not a reasoned critique of immigration policy. It is a naked display of bigotry, racism, and dehumanization. By singling out an entire ethnic and religious group — immigrants from Somalia, including a U.S. citizen elected to Congress, Ilhan Omar — he broadcasts a dangerous message: that people of certain backgrounds are disposable, undeserving of the rights and dignity that define America.
It aligns with his broader ideological agenda — white-nativism, exclusion, and an effort to mobilize his political base through fear, hatred, and division. This isn’t about integration or assimilation; it’s about erecting walls — physical, social, and moral — around whiteness and Christian-majority America, while casting people of color, Muslims, and immigrants as threats to the nation’s identity.
It’s no coincidence that such contempt comes amid aggressive crackdowns: reports suggest his administration is preparing Immigration and Customs Enforcement “strike teams” for mass deportations targeting Somali communities in Minnesota.
By dehumanizing Somalis, Trump lays ideological and rhetorical groundwork for systematic repression, erasing the line between “immigration law enforcement” and ethnic cleansing of whole communities.
A cruel irony: Trump’s own family’s immigrant roots
It’s an ugly hypocrisy that the man leading this crusade against immigrants descends himself — through marriage, naturalization, and private business — from immigrants. His wives, too, were not part of some ancient American founding class. Yet here he stands, calling other immigrants “garbage.”
That bitter irony exposes the argument for what it really is: not about law or national security, but about ideology — white nativist ideology, which sees immigrants of color as inferior, unwelcome, un-American.
Maine’s Somali community: real people, real contributions
The state I call home, Maine, is itself home to a growing Somali community, centered in cities like Portland and Lewiston, Maine. According to the most recent census data, there are roughly 3,000  Somali-born residents in Maine, many of them living in Portland or Lewiston.
In these cities, Somali immigrants and their families have worked tirelessly to build lives, businesses, and communities. They established community centers, helped one another navigate social services, found jobs, paid taxes — and despite hateful myths and scapegoating, they have contributed concretely to the state’s social and economic life.
Take Safiya Khalid, who came to America as a seven-year-old refugee from Somalia, grew up in Lewiston, and in 2019 became the first Somali American elected to the Lewiston City Council — and the youngest ever.
Or consider Deqa Dhalac, born in Mogadishu, Somalia, she immigrated in the early 1990s, moved to Maine, worked as an interpreter and community organizer, and eventually became the first Somali-American mayor in U.S. history when she was elected mayor of South Portland in 2021. Today she serves in the Maine House of Representatives.
These are not political tokens. They are mothers, workers, organizers, people whose lives reflect the best of what America can be: a home for refugees, an opportunity for immigrants, a chance to rebuild, contribute, and belong.
Yet Trump’s words treat them like trash.
Why this scorched public rebuke matters
Because when a leader of a nation mocks entire communities as “garbage,” it emboldens racists, bigots, and xenophobes to act. His words are not benign, they are poisonous.
Because the president’s rhetoric attempts to strip Somali Americans, and all immigrants of color, of their identity, agency, and humanity, reducing them to stereotypes for political gain.
Because Maine’s Somali community — and communities like them across the country — deserve to be honored for their resilience, their contributions, and their humanity.
Because America was built on immigration. On hope. On the idea that people seeking refuge, safety, dignity should be welcomed, not vilified.
If Trump does not immediately retract his words, if the administration proceeds with raids, deportations, or policies targeting entire communities, it will be complicit in a moral atrocity.
We cannot stay silent. We cannot treat this as “just politics.” This is a moral crisis. And we — citizens, neighbors, voters — must speak out, demand accountability, and insist: immigrants are not garbage.

(Photo by Fajrul Islam/Moment via Getty Images)When people use hand gestures that visually represent what they’re saying, listeners see them as more clear, competent and persuasive. That’s the key finding from my new research published in the Journal of Marketing Research, where I analyzed thousands of TED Talks and ran controlled experiments to examine how gestures shape communication.
 
Talking with your hands
Whether you’re giving a presentation, pitching an idea or leading a meeting, you probably spend most of your prep time thinking about what you’ll say. But what about the ways you’ll move your hands?
I grew up in Italy, where gesturing is practically a second language. Now that I live in the United States, I’ve become acutely aware of how cultures differ in how, and how much, people move their hands when they talk. Still, across contexts and cultures, one thing is constant: People do talk with their hands.
As someone who studies communication, I’d noticed how some speakers seemed instantly clearer when they gestured. This made me wonder: Do gestures actually make communicators more effective?
The short answer is yes, but only when the gestures visually represent the idea you’re talking about. Researchers call these movements “illustrators.” For example:

When talking about distance, you might spread your hands apart while saying something is “farther away.”
When explaining how two concepts relate, you might bring your hands together while saying “these ideas fit together.”
When describing how the market demand “is going up and down,” you could visually depict a wave shape with your hands.

To study gestures at scale, my team and I analyzed 200,000 video segments from more than 2,000 TED Talks using AI tools that can detect and classify hand gestures frame by frame. We paired this with controlled experiments in which our study participants evaluated entrepreneurs pitching a product.
The same pattern of results appeared in both settings. In the AI-analyzed TED Talk data, illustrative gestures predicted higher audience evaluations, reflected in more than 33 million online “likes” of the videos. And in our experiments, 1,600 participants rated speakers who used illustrative gestures as more clear, competent and persuasive.
 
How hands can help get your point across
What I found is that these gestures give listeners a visual shortcut to your meaning. They make abstract ideas feel more concrete, helping listeners build a mental picture of what you’re saying. This makes the message feel easier to process — a phenomenon psychologists call “processing fluency.” And we found that when ideas feel easier to grasp, people tend to see the speaker as more competent and persuasive.
But not all gestures help. Movements that don’t match the message — like random waving, fidgeting or pointing to things in the space — offer no such benefit. In some cases, they can even distract.
A practical takeaway: Focus on clarity over choreography. Think about where your hands naturally illustrate what you’re saying — emphasizing size, direction or emotion — and let them move with purpose.
 
What’s next
Your hands aren’t just accessories to your words. They can be a powerful tool to make your ideas resonate.
I’m now investigating whether people can learn to gesture better — almost like developing a nonverbal vocabulary. Early pilot tests are promising: Even a 5-minute training session helps people become clearer and more effective through the use of appropriate hand gestures.
While my research examined how individual gestures work together with spoken language, the next step is to understand what makes a communicator effective with their voice and, ultimately, across all the channels they use to communicate — how gestures combine with voice, facial expressions and body movement. I’m now exploring AI tools that track all these channels at once so I can identify the patterns, not just the isolated gestures, that make speakers more effective communicators.

But Acting Secretary Walter Simmons was largely confident at his agency's first committee appearance.","House Health and Government Operations Committee listens to a briefing Friday on the newly established Maryland Department of Social and Economic Mobility. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s newest department already had a tall order, to “advance social and economic mobility for all Marylanders,” as Acting Secretary Walter Simmons describes it.
Then, two days after the law creating the Department of Social and Economic Mobility took effect, the federal government made it more challenging by declaring that race- and sex-based eligibility for Disadvantaged Business Enterprise status was itself discriminatory. It’s a change that Simmons estimates could affect up to 7,000 businesses in the state.
But Simmons was largely confident Friday in a briefing for the House Health and Government Operations Committee on the role of the new department and the efforts to stand it up. It was the first public appearance for the new agency.
The hearing came one day after the driving force behind its creation, House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) announced she was stepping down from leadership, a fact that was noted at the meeting. But mostly the hearing dealt with the details of setting up a new Cabinet-level department.
The law creating the department took effect Oct. 1 and Simmons became its acting secretary on Oct. 20. He summarized its mission: “To advance social and economic mobility for all Marylanders by removing barriers, investing in inclusive opportunities and aligning these resources. That is something that we are going to be heavily focused on…but also being able to frame it to ensure efficient government efficiency through this work.”

The law creating the department rolls threes existing offices into the new agency: the Office of Minority Business Enterprises in the state Department of Transportation; the Office of Small, Minority, and Women Business Affairs; and the Office of Social Equity in the Maryland Cannabis Administration.
Part of the department’s responsibilities will include promoting and encouraging participation in the regulated cannabis industry by individuals previously impacted “by the war on drugs,” and supporting small or disadvantaged businesses and monitoring trends in social equity programs and policies nationwide.
Del. Harry Bhandari (D-Baltimore County) asked Simmons what the first structural barriers are that the department has taken on since it became established.
Simmons said daily administrative functions remain such staffing, receiving keys to an office and getting emails.
He received help from Yolanda Maria Martinez, special secretary of the Office of Small, Minority, and Women Business Affairs. “She gave me her desk,” Simmons said, while sitting next to Martinez who arrived a few minutes later during the briefing.
But one major challenged that Simmons highlighted was the federal change to its DBE standards. Those changes, published in the Federal Register on Oct. 3,  the U.S. Department of Transportation issued an order that “removes race- and sex-based presumptions of social and economic disadvantage that violate the U.S. Constitution.”
Under the new rule, in order for any business to qualify for certification through a disadvantaged business enterprise or Airport Concessions DBE program must not only provide financial documentation, but also write a “narrative or case-specific justification for all applications.”
Simmons said that could affect more than 7,000 businesses in the state.
“Everybody knows that historically, minorities and women have had a disadvantage for the last 400 years. You don’t have to prove that you have an economic disadvantage, because we know you’ve been economically disadvantaged,” Simmons said after the nearly one-hour briefing.
“The Trump administration says, ‘No, throw that out.’ They [federal government] said that because they’re minority and they’re women [and] that they’re disadvantaged, that’s actually discrimination,” he said of the feds’ reasoning.

The department is required to submit a report to the governor and General Assembly by July 1 that identifies all state programs and units that have a social equity component and provide recommendations on how they can be “reorganized, coordinated, or otherwise made more effective and more efficient to promote social equity.”
Near the end of the briefing, committee chair Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) praised Simmons. Peña-Melnyk and several other committee members are familiar with his work as president and CEO of Employ Prince George’s, a quasi-government nonprofit organization founded in 2018 that provides workforce development programs and other duties.
“I can hear your passion. I will sleep well at night knowing that you’re in charge,” Peña-Melnyk said.
She also praised Jones’ work to create the department.
“This is her baby,” Peña-Melnyk said. “It reflects her lasting vision that equity and economic mobility must be permanent, coordinated priorities of state government.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MD-Health-and-Government-Operations-Committee-12-5-2025-1024x579.jpeg,,,2025-12-06 09:57:05.900125

(Screenshot from GRAC video)Supporters of mid-decade redistricting in Maryland showed up in force for a virtual meeting of a state advisory commission Friday, calling on state leaders to redo congressional maps to oppose President Donald Trump (R).
It was the third hearing of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission and the third different outcome: Redistricting opponents dominated the first hearing and the second was nearly evenly split. Redistricting proponents dominated Friday’s meeting, thanks to a slew of climate and civil rights advocates, union leaders, a few retired federal employees and even a high school student.
Also joining the chorus was Bobby LaPin, the Maryland social media personality who has announced his intention to run against Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City), a commission member who opposes mid-cycle redistricting.
The commission will meet at least once more, on Dec. 12, to hear public comment.
The redistricting saga began with Trump urging Republican-led states to redistrict for partisan gain before the 2026 elections, to pick up GOP seats in Congress. Red states that have passed new maps so far include Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. Democrats in California and Virginia have fired back with maps of their own.
The clock is ticking for Maryland to decide whether it will join the redistricting fray, with the filing deadline for the 2026 election on Feb. 24. The General Assembly convenes on Jan. 14, but it remains unclear whether Gov. Wes Moore (D) will call a special legislative session to address the matter sooner.
With battle lines drawn on redistricting, Ferguson and Moore work to shift line in their favor

The opposition of Ferguson, and by extension his chamber, is a significant barrier for the governor’s effort.
LaPin, who has not yet filed to run against Ferguson, seems to be making the issue a centerpiece for his campaign. During his remarks, the Baltimore charter sailboat captain held up a copy of “Project 2025,” a roadmap that he believes Trump is following to concentrate power in the executive branch.
“We have witnessed where this got us: asked police taking away our neighbors, the U.S. military occupying American cities, science being overridden, civil servants being threatened — basically rights stripped away with just the stroke of a pen,” LaPin said.
“We have the power in Maryland to be one of the states that answers back,” he said.
That view was echoed by more than two dozen other speakers Friday. Though many said they would oppose gerrymandering under normal circumstances, they viewed Trump’s effort as an extraordinary assault on voting rights — requiring an extraordinary response.
“We’re in a fight, and we have to fight back,” said Jim Schmitz, a resident of Riverdale Park. “Doing nothing in the hope that other states will notice and do nothing is only a wish. The moral high ground will not protect us.”
Ellen Hornstein, a retired attorney for the U.S. Forest Service, agreed. Hornstein said she left federal service on Trump’s inauguration date.
“I retired because I believed I could no longer uphold the rule of law in the United States. And that has proven true, and I’m doing everything I can now to fight for democracy,” Hornstein said.
Third Act Maryland, a climate advocacy group for seniors, threw its  support behind the idea, and several members spoke during Friday’s meeting.
“In normal times, I would oppose any redistricting for partisan purposes, but these are far from normal times,” said Cynthia Miller, a Third Act member from Huntingtown in Calvert CountySouthern. “The dangers to our democracy, our communities and our civil liberties are real and present.”
Redistricting opponents, however, expressed concern about the implications of redrawing districts. Democrats control seven of Maryland’s eight House districts. Only District 1, which covers the Eastern Shore and sweeps westward to include portions of Baltimore and Harford counties, is held by a Republican.
Teris Pantazes, who said he lives in Baltimore County close to the Harford County line, said District 1 should stay as-is, because those Western Shore communities are similar to Eastern Shore communities. Pantazes said that if voters from Annapolis were drawn into District 1 — one potential idea — he would feel it an effort to “minimize my voice.”
“I’ve heard some people say that Annapolis has the water economy, and it’s a lot like people on the Eastern Shore. Annapolis is nothing like — it has no similarities to places like Federalsburg,” Pantazes said. “Those who claim it are severely misguided.

There wasn’t much debate among panelists and audience members, with the group seeming to agree that the root of the problems facing higher education comes from liberals and the ideas they bring with them.
“The critical thing here to understand is … what has actually gone wrong? Well, a lot of things have gone wrong,” said panelist and American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Joshua Katz. “Who’s responsible? Well, a lot of people are responsible.”

Created by a law passed in the last legislative session, the UI Center for Intellectual Freedom is an entity governed by the Iowa Board of Regents with the goal of expanding intellectual diversity and civics education at the university. The center’s 26-person advisory council is in charge of finding a permanent director to replace de Castro and will advise on academic and other matters.
Kicking off the affair was the “Centers Strategy Colloquium,” which will continue Saturday with discussion of past efforts to create centers similar to the UI’s and the work going on now within the center. While the event was public, only panelists and those invited to attend were allowed to ask questions during the sessions.
The “Reforming Universities Summit” will take place Saturday afternoon with remarks from Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, former regent and current U.S. Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education David Barker and others. Sessions will cover the question of whether universities can be reformed and “possible actions and next steps,” with a “Capstone Session” ending the event.
Center Interim Director Luciano de Castro said in a previous interview the center, and the events it holds, are “the democratic process” in action, as Iowa voters made their opinions clear in electing the lawmakers who voted to create the center and shape its mission. Ideas and thoughts brought up during the inaugural event will be “extremely valuable to orient what we do in the center,” de Castro said.
‘What is wrong with universities?’
Main problems identified by panelists related to the actions faculty do or do not take when it comes to fostering debate not only among students, but among their colleagues and in higher education as well, and what universities base their work and priorities on.
Nicola Persico, a managerial economics and decision sciences professor at Northwestern University, provided the “context” that liberals outweigh conservatives in both faculty and administration and that faculty are more likely to say a liberal person would fit in their department than a conservative one. The only “problem” he identified stems from these facts, that faculty are self-censoring in the classroom, in research discussions and online.
Texas A&M University engineering professor John Criscione said faculty need to be “guardians at the gate” to protect higher education’s mission of supporting the exchanging and debate of ideas and the pursuit of truth, especially as “propagandists” seek to take control of powerful institutions at the junction of youth teaching and adult beliefs.
Universities are prioritizing productivity above anything else, he said, when they should be prioritizing the search for truth.
“I think universities really need to change society for the better. There’s no question on that …,” Criscione said. “Our mechanism, our approach to doing that, I think, is pursuing the truth, discovering knowledge, disseminating knowledge, that will change society, that will improve it. If we pick a particular approach, we decide society needs to change in this way, I don’t think we can have credibility.”
‘How did we end up here?’
Panelists had plenty of people, and the ideas they introduced to higher education, to blame for where the industry is now.
Katz separated those responsible for higher education’s issues into two categories — “sheep” and “crazies.” The sheep are “almost everybody,” he said, with the crazies at the fringes of both ends of the political and ideological spectrums. Nearly all university faculty fall into the sheep category, and if they follow a bad idea things can, and have, gone very wrong.
Crazies used to be a small minority of academic units, Katz said, but now there are more of them and they are “malevolent.”
“Don’t hire crazies, don’t be a sheep, and let’s hope that the Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa can fix whatever problems there are,” Katz said.
It’s not just the people that have caused problems in higher education, said Texas A&M University finance professor Adam Kolasinski, but the belief they bring with them that “the very fabric of society” is biased against certain people and groups and the “moral crusade” they want to undertake.
“Far left ideology” has been present in U.S. higher education for a very long time, Kolasinski said, but one touchstone moment in the movement was “the rise of critical race theory in law schools” in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He said the “liberal left” had continuing frustration that results of the Civil Rights Movement weren’t followed with as big of changes for minority communities as was hoped, which led to “crackdowns on speech they did not approve of” and “over-discrimination against whites.”
“Left liberals” also have the “fundamental misunderstanding of human nature in the post-war era” that poverty is mostly, or solely, caused by external factors rather than internal ones, he said. This belief led to race-conscious hiring practices, censoring of voices who did not disagree and a “hierarchy of oppression” that brought forward diversity, equity and inclusion programming.
Academics have been pushed out or silenced for going against these ideas, Kolasinski said. He provided the example of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who stepped down from his Harvard University presidency after suggesting women were less represented in STEM fields because of “intrinsic aptitude.”
Summers, who was teaching at Harvard and held the position of director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, has stepped away from the university again due to his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
When asked how to deal with faculty pushing “critical” study and ideologies, Katz said more discussions need to be had around tenure. He added that the “only way to fix anything, at least within two generations,” is to get rid of the employees who shouldn’t have been hired in the first place. Kolasinksi agreed and said if universities can get university leaders who would “stand up against” these faculty members, then “the kooks will be marginalized.”
Some panelists pointed to decades and centuries of past philosophical changes that have led to this point, with Iván Marinovic, associate professor of accounting at Stanford University, suggesting that much of higher education “rejects reason as traditionally understood” and is skeptical and suspicious of “western values.”
“The traditional aim of inquiry has been replaced by a commitment to political activism and a very narrow vision of social justice,” Marinovic said. “The world is interpreted through a rigid oppressor, oppressed framework, reducing persons primarily to their race, gender and sexual orientation.”
The way to fix this problem, he said, is to once again open higher education to “the whole breadth of reason,” including moral, religious and metaphysical inquiry and the approach to deep questions with “intellectual honesty and hope.”
Clara Reynen, a University of Iowa graduate student and Unity Chair in the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students, said she was concerned about what she heard during the panel discussions and thought speakers didn’t “provide any sort of solid, consistent argument to support the creation of the center.”
“Contrary to some of the panelists,” Reynen said, she does believe in self-censoring in her role as an instructor unless a student asks directly, as she is teaching course materials and not her personal feelings.
Other students she’s spoken to have expressed disappointment in the center’s structure, as its director will have near-total control of hiring professors, inviting guest speakers and other actions.
“I think that it’s very clear that folks here are not actually interested in freedom of expression,” Reynen said. “If they were, they would be doing things to make sure that our university did have more equitable access for everybody, and weren’t just appointing from within.”
De Castro ended the event for the evening with a note of “optimism” about the truth and those seeking it.
“Truth has quality that only the truth has, which is the correspondence to reality, and just because of that, you can have for a long time things that are wrong, things that go in the wrong direction, but truth remains, and eventually will prevail,” de Castro said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska Board of Regents voted Friday to eliminate four academic programs at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, three of them unanimously.
The eight-member board approved eliminating the departments of statistics, earth and atmospheric sciences, educational administration and textiles, merchandising and fashion design. Together, the cuts total $6.74 million; 51.5 positions will be cut, most of them faculty.


Eliminated programs

Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ($1.85 million, 13 positions eliminated).
Statistics ($1.75 million, 12 positions eliminated).
Educational Administration ($1.69 million, 15.5 positions eliminated).
Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design ($1.45 million, 11 positions eliminated).



There are 541 current students in the four cut departments, according to board materials.
The eliminated programs will be phased out over the next couple of years, with some additional department funds retained to support any remaining students who stay after the cuts. NU has a policy to help students who choose to stay after their programs are eliminated.
Bennett has said the programs that will now be eliminated fell below standards for granting degrees, in addition to falling low on a new metrics-based, targeted budget reductions plan that Bennett implemented to avoid across-the-board cuts.
“Positioning ourselves in a place of financial stability will ensure we can continue delivering excellence and student success, research and service to communities throughout our state,” Bennett said.
‘This hurts’
Of the student representatives on the regents, whose votes are nonbinding, one student regent supported all four program eliminations: UNL Student Regent Libby Wilkins.
“Nobody thinks this is good for our university. This hurts. This hurts every single one of us,” Wilkins said. “But I cannot vote ‘no’ when I understand that this would impact more of our students, our enrollment and the entire student experience at the University of Nebraska.”

Regents also unanimously approved merging four departments into two combined areas. The mergers will be finalized in 2026. Each is estimated to save $1 million. The departments to be merged are plant pathology and entomology as well as agricultural economics and agricultural leadership, education and communication.
‘Students won’t be marketable’
Of more than 100 speakers over five hours Friday, a vast majority of them students and faculty in affected programs, many said any students who remain won’t receive the same quality education, yet they will pay the same cost to attend. No speakers favored the cuts.
“A few faculty cannot provide the comprehensive curriculum, field work and experiential learning required for industry and government jobs,” said Dawn Kopacz, a professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. “Our students won’t be marketable.”

Many speakers urged regents to delay and find alternatives. An advisory group of faculty, staff and students told Bennett that his tight budget window didn’t allow time to solidify alternatives. 
The cuts were announced Sept. 12. Bennett forwarded them to the regents Nov. 10.
Bhaskar Bhattacharya, head of the Department of Statistics, offered a proposal Friday to merge his department with the University of Nebraska Medical Center Department of Biostatistics. He also proposed stepping back from his leadership role if needed. Many educational administration faculty proposed a more cohesive administrative structure with UNMC and the central NU system office for administrative cuts, a plan they said has been years in the making.
At a special Nov. 21 meeting, regents unanimously authorized President Jeffrey Gold to merge UNL and UNMC as a joint accreditation unit, largely for research reporting and college rankings.
‘A laughable goal’
Susan VanderPlas, an associate professor of statistics, again called out the new Bennett-led metrics-based approach. VanderPlas and other statisticians at UNL said they reviewed the approach and found various flaws. They said they’d grade the data analysis an “F.”
VanderPlas said statisticians are usually “pretty quiet people,” but she said she saw this semester what it takes to get statisticians “pissed off”: “You really just have to come for the data.” She said statistics faculty found savings, but “no one in administration had ears to hear.”
“Eliminating statistics will cripple this university,” VanderPlas said. “It will damage its reputation, and it will make reentry into the AAU [Association of American Universities] a laughable goal.”

VanderPlas’ 9-year-old son, Alex, also pleaded to the board. He said he wants to stay in Nebraska and one day become a paleoartist or paleontologist. Alex told regents their job is to protect the university and ensure it helps Nebraskans, as well as Nebraskans like Alex who want to “study rocks and numbers and books and weather and other things.”
“Preserve them for the future and so more Nebraskans can be Huskers,” Alex said.
The AAU goal that VanderPlas mentioned has been a longstanding aim for the regents and Gold. In 2011, AAU members voted to boot UNL from the organization for failing to meet membership criteria. UNL had been a member since 1909.
Many faculty said these now-approved cuts put the AAU dream even more out of reach and will make it an outlier without critical departments. Many said the cuts also don’t consider net revenues for the departments and that UNL might be hurt more in the long run.
‘We had to make our budget numbers’
Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha opposed all but the educational administration cut and suggested a two-month delay. In response, Bennett stood by his budget plan and told Weitz, to laughs from faculty and students: “We considered every alternative that we could think of.”

“We had to make our budget numbers,” Bennett said. “So, the absence of any alternative plan that was feasible, I came forward with a final recommendation that’s been presented.”
Seeking to confirm Weitz’s votes after the meeting, Weitz confirmed by text her opposition to the statistics and earth and atmospheric sciences cuts. But she said she opposed the educational administration cut. She said “yes” at the meeting during that vote and voted “no” to the textiles, merchandising and fashion design elimination.
The Examiner provided Weitz time stamps from the meeting livestream to confirm her votes. She did not immediately respond to a follow-up question.
Unclear future for Bennett
The UNL Faculty Senate voted 60-14 last month to express “no confidence” in Bennett. Just a handful of testifiers cited that action Friday. Bennett has not formally responded to the Faculty Senate decision but has continually said he adhered to all applicable budget policies.
Bennett again declined to directly address the Faculty Senate action Friday but told the Examiner that budget and academic reductions are never what a chancellor wants. He previously served for almost a decade as president of the University of Southern Mississippi, which faced almost annual budget cuts while he was there.

“I have a lot of empathy and sensitivity for all the individuals that will be impacted directly and certainly for our campus community,” Bennett said. “We have a lot of work to do ahead of us in terms of implementation. We’re going to do that with a lot of care and concern for everybody who’s impacted.”
Bennett’s contract ends June 30. It has not yet been extended, and Bennett repeated Friday he does not know if or when that might happen.Regents have scheduled meetings in February, April and June. In October, Bennett told the Examiner he desired a contract extension.
“You got to talk to the boss about that,” Bennett said when asked again if his contract would come up for a vote soon. Gold was not immediately available for comment.
Regent Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City again publicly thanked and defended Bennett’s work.
Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, board chair, read a resolution in support of Gold that he said had unanimous board support. While the resolution was not included in board materials, according to Kenney, regents commended “all the leaders from across our campuses who have stepped up in [these] difficult budget decisions at this time.”
A broader reductions plan
UNL’s cuts and mergers are part of a total $27.5 million budget plan put forth by Bennett. 
The remaining parts of his plan do not require Board of Regents approval, such as $2 million in private philanthropy to cover mandated tuition waivers and an early retirement plan for long-time tenured faculty, which 69 faculty have been approved to accept by Jan. 5.
Breaking down UNL’s final $27.5 million budget cut proposal

Of reductions, $21 million is a structural deficit as UNL expenses continue to outpace revenues. The rest is “proactive” and meant to “help safeguard against repetitive budget reduction cycles.” 
Bennett told the Examiner that of the cuts that did not require regents’ approval: “Everything is moving along at sort of the pace that we expected it to move along. Nothing is complete yet, but we were sort of in line with the deadlines.”
No longer will ‘kick the can’
Regents largely cited the need to act now to mitigate future cuts and said that part of the reason UNL is in its current predicament is a decade of relying on cash reserves.
“We cannot continue to kick the can,” said Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, the longest current serving regent now in his 17th year.

Regent Jim Scheer, a state senator between 2013 and 2021, including serving his last four years as speaker of the Legislature, said he was empathetic with every single person who spoke. He said he would be advocating the same had he been in their shoes. 
“But from my perspective, I’ve got to make sure that there is a university for people to go to, not just next year, but 10 years from now,” Scheer said. “Shake your heads, but it’s true.”
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Scheer to succeed him on the board after Pillen became governor in 2023, after 10 years as a regent. Scheer ran unopposed for election to a six-year term in 2024. Pillen, in January, proposed a 2% cut to NU’s budget. After months of negotiation, NU secured a 0.625% increase in state dollars. Regents last year requested a 3.5% increase.
Scheer placed blame for many NU budget problems on slowing legislative investments over the last decade. He and many others have said those investments have not kept up with inflation and NU has run at more than a $100 million loss each year, which isn’t “chump change.”

To those who attended Friday’s meeting, Scheer said maybe five of them raised their hands and said they went to the Legislature. Scheer told those in attendance: “We got to the game late.”
“Without those extra dollars, we run into a problem where we’re just like everybody else,” Scheer said. “The university has got a checking account, and it’s got to balance.”
Many faculty and students and some regents predicted there might be more cuts to come in the future. Kevin Hanrahan, a professor of voice and voice pedagogy and new chair of UNL’s advisory Academic Planning Committee, said there is no more “fat” to trim, which UNMC Student Regent Brock Calamari echoed.
Last-minute delay fumbles
Regent Rob Schafer of Beatrice said he listened to the speakers and that, of all cuts, the earth and atmospheric sciences cut was the one he thought could use more time to reconsider.

Robert Szot, originally from Texas, said he specifically came to Nebraska for graduate studies in meteorology. He was among the earth and atmospheric sciences students to uplift the life-saving nature of meteorology and geology work. He and another student noted Nebraskans depend on the life-saving data, which includes storm chasing research teams.
Szot said Friday’s action might be remembered similarly to the 2003 “hasty” decision to fire Husker head football coach Frank Solich after a 9-3 winning season. 
“Nebraskans will either remember December 5, 2025, as the day the Board of Regents voted ‘no,’ stood up for the state, chose to be visionary, or the day that sent this university to a spiral for which it never recovered,” Szot said.
Deborah Bathke, the state climatologist, said cuts at the federal level make it even more important to maintain state expertise. She said cutting programs doesn’t make weather and climate challenges disappear, just harder to address.
University of Nebraska Regent Jack Stark of Omaha. Dec. 5, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Schafer’s motion failed 4-4. It required 5 votes. Schafer, Weitz and Omaha Regents Jack Stark and Elizabeth O’Connor supported a delay. Clare, Kenney, Scheer and Wilmot opposed it.
Scheer said he didn’t want to give “false hope” that something “miraculously” would change by the regents’ next meeting in February. 
‘Stick with us’
O’Connor said regents have been warning people for years that regents would soon be cutting at the “heart” of NU. She said Friday reached that point.
“We’re past the time now of the university warning people,” O’Connor said. “I think this is a full-out five-alarm fire as to the state of higher education in Nebraska. I’m sitting on this board, and I’m telling you, we’re scared.”
Scheer and Stark said the cuts could one day be reversed, with Stark offering a “big ask” to those impacted.
“Stick with us,” Stark said. “We’ll get through this, somehow.”

Attorney Adam Crayk said Friday his client is among the first in Utah to be detained during an appointment with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles applications for green cards, citizenship and work authorization.
In the past, he said, “they’ve never been the enforcement arm.”
Similar arrests at the agency’s offices have been documented for months in other states like California and Florida. But Crayk said they didn’t start in Utah until roughly two weeks ago, with three of his clients detained there since.

The apparent escalation in enforcement follows a change in leadership at Salt Lake City’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, with a U.S. Border Patrol official now assigned to oversee its operations, Crayk said.  
ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not answer a request for comment sent via email Friday.
Crayk and fellow immigration attorney Nicholle Pitt White agree that those with upcoming appointments at the office face an incredibly difficult reality. 
Pitt White worries that ICE operations ramping up at the field office in Salt Lake City will create even more fear and drive immigrants further into the shadows rather than incentivize them to pursue legal status.
“There’s no safe way to do anything anymore,” she said
As people try to follow the law and secure a legal status, Pitt White said many now feel “really stuck between a rock and a hard place.”
“If you don’t show up, then they can send you to immigration court and ICE can arrest you anyway,” Crayk added. For those who go to their check-ins, he said, “if there’s some sort of thing they’ve determined you’re arrestable on, they’re going to arrest you.”

On Tuesday, homeland security agents noted the young father overstayed a visa after being brought to the United States as a child. They also said they considered a mark on his juvenile record to be a criminal conviction, though the case has since been expunged, the attorney said.  
And while his legal team expects he will eventually get a green card, they’re working to get him out of detention first.
Before the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, authorities did not cite juvenile matters as a basis for detaining someone, Crayk said. They have not recognized expungements in the adult system since the 1990s. 
Another of his clients completed the first step in a process waiving an earlier deportation order and allowing her to stay in the United States while she applies for a green card, according to copies of documents from her case with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
When she went to the office Nov.19 to get her fingerprints taken as part of the process, the 54-year-old woman was detained and later brought to Mexico, where she’s originally from, Crayk said. She had lived in the United States for 28 years, Crayk said.
She has traffic tickets but no criminal history, he added. 
ICE operations in Utah were relatively quiet — until an airport arrest shook SLC leaders

A third client detained at the office has a prior criminal conviction, he said.  
Pitt White is a liaison for the Utah Immigration Advocacy Coalition, which issued a community alert Thursday warning of the situation.
She told Utah News Dispatch she worries that this tactic is meant to “create fear, create panic” and encourage undocumented immigrants in the U.S. “to just leave, so that they don’t have to do any work to get them to go.” 
From California, Pitt White said she’s heard of instances of mothers “having their babies ripped out of their arms and being arrested by (ICE) at these interviews.” She added she’s thankful she hasn’t seen that happening in Utah, but she’s worried it could.
Pitt White said so far none of her own clients have been impacted, but she’s nervous for at least one client who had an interview at the field office scheduled for Friday. 
For immigrants who have an upcoming appointment with USCIS in Salt Lake City who aren’t already represented by an attorney, Pitt White encouraged them to have a consultation with an attorney before going. 
“I’m not saying they need to hire an attorney to go with them or anything like that, but I think that an attorney is going to be the best person to give them that risk assessment, so they can have that information and be prepared,” she said.  
She also noted there are nonprofits like the Wasatch Immigration Project based in Park City that does pro-bono work.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_4945-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-05 21:56:36.478182

(Photo by Judy Patrick/provided by ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc.)President Donald Trump has signed a resolution backed by members of Alaska’s Congressional delegation to revoke restrictions on drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve on the North Slope.
The White House announced Friday evening that Trump had signed Senate Joint Resolution 80 into law. 
SJR 80 uses the Congressional Review Act to reverse restrictions enacted during the administration of President Joe Biden. Those restrictions, imposed as part of a 2022 activity plan for the reserve, were intended to protect environmentally sensitive areas against harm from oil and gas drilling.
Developers and drilling advocates opposed the restrictions, saying they could deter work that would provide revenue for local residents and Alaskans at large. Trump has also been interested in developing Alaska’s oil reserves as part of a broader effort to increase American energy production and reduce imports.

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is approximately 23.5 million acres. Located to the west of Alaska’s vast Prudhoe Bay oil fields it — unlike the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve to the east — has been the subject of interest from oil companies.
ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project, approved during the Biden administration, was the first major project to take place in the reserve, and others are planned.
Friday’s signing was one of several Trump administration actions taking place simultaneously to reduce regulatory obstacles for developers interested in drilling within the reserve.

Leadership with Iowa Farmers Union said all of the congressional and Senate candidates were invited to attend the forum. The attending candidates were all seeking the Democratic nominations in their respective races. 
Each candidate was asked to respond to the question: How do the values of Iowa farmers, ranchers and rural community members shape your vision for the future of Iowa?

District 1:
Christina Bohannan, who has run against U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks in the past two elections, said her family “like many many families in Iowa” could not make it in farming, even though it’s what they wanted to do. 
Bohannan said protecting and expanding markets for farmers is something she would fight for in Congress. 
The Democrat from Iowa City also pointed to corporate corruption in politics, which she said has also allowed for greater consolidation in the farm economy that ultimately “hurts Iowa farmers and hurts our agricultural economy.” 
She said her time spent in rural communities across her district has given her the skills to “get bipartisan support” to pass a Farm Bill. 
The federal piece of legislation which outlines farm policy, subsidies and nutrition assistance programs has not been reauthorized since 2018. 
Bohannan said she would also work to break down agricultural consolidation and the lack of competition in farm input industries like fertilizer and seeds. 
She said congressional leaders also need to negotiate for open markets so that farmers “can see the fruits of their labor.” 
Miller-Meeks is running again for the seat. Bohannan is competing for the Democratic nomination against Taylor Wettach, who also spoke at the Friday event. 
Wettach, a trade and national security lawyer from Muscatine, called farmers the “heart and the backbone of our state.” 
Wettach said Iowa Farmers Union values “are the vision” and the “moral compass” dictating the path forward. Wettach, a seventh-generation Iowan, said work ethic, integrity, fairness, responsibility and faith in community are the ethics he was raised with. 
Wettach said farmers, and therefore rural communities have been “squeezed” by consolidation in the seed, fertilizer markets and meatpacking industries. 
“For too long, corporate greed and political neglect have put rural Iowa on the ropes,” Wettach said. 
He advocated for enforcement of antitrust laws, supporting small and midsized farmers and local food processing and purchasing. 
District 2:
Lindsay James, currently serving as a state legislator from Dubuque, said her conversations with rural Iowans often center on the “impossible decisions” they are forced to make because of the current economic reality.
James said these issues impact Iowans everywhere, but for farmers, she said it means they’re picking up extra jobs and sacrificing social opportunities. 
James said it’s not just a policy failure, but a “moral failure.” 
“Iowa is not Iowa without our farmers, and we need to have policies that are going to help our farmers, our producers, our growers, truly thrive,” James said. 
James said rural communities need grocery stores, hospitals, public schools, small farms and post offices. 
Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District seat is currently occupied by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who has announced plans to run for U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst’s seat in the Senate. 
Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, and former state lawmaker Joe Mitchell are running for the Republican spot on the ticket. 
Clint Twedt-Ball is a Cedar Rapids pastor and founder of the organization Matthew 25 who is also running for the Democratic nomination in the district. 
As a fourth-generation Iowan, Twedt-Ball said rural Iowans and farmers are “an optimistic people.” 
He said it takes optimism for farmers to do their job, especially under all of the challenges they currently face. 
Twedt-Ball said “it’s time” for a Farm Bill that supports family farmers, diversified crops and water quality. 
“We need to get back to a place where ‘America needs farmers’ is much more than a sticker on the Hawkeyes’ helmets,” Twedt-Ball said.

Kathy Dolter, another Democrat running for the seat, said Friday that as a retired nurse, she “can’t stand by and watch people suffer,” as she said they are under the current policies from President Donald Trump. 
“We Iowans all need to use our voices and our votes to make Iowa strong and make America, America again,” Dolter said. 
She listed a number of policies she would prioritize, including: a higher minimum wage, an end to trade tariffs, continued funding for wind and solar energy, right to repair laws and support for rural post offices, hospitals, schools and grocery stores. 
Guy Morgan, a Democrat who grew up in Garden City, also spoke Friday about his campaign which focuses on water quality, support for small and midsized farmers and environmental issues. 
District 3:
Sarah Trone Garriott, a state senator from West Des Moines and a pastor, said the things that “bring us together” like hospitals, child care and public schools, in a rural community are being “chipped away at.”
She said the decisions of the current administration, like tariffs and a system that “does not allow for diversification” on the farm are “hurting the future of agriculture.”
Trone Garriott said it’s time for a new Farm Bill that supports diverse operations, conservation practices and local food markets. 
“We want to make sure that people can stay in their rural communities and support their families and have a great future and a good life that they can pass on to their children,” Trone Garriott said. “But we need leaders who are willing to go and fight for that.”

Trone Garriott is running for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn. She is vying for a Democratic nomination against Rep. Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, and several other candidates.
Konfrst, who served as House minority leader, said she would stand up for Iowans from all counties, because the future of the state and the country “involves every single one of you.” 
“Because it can’t just be the counties that are growing, it has to be everyone,” Konfrst said. “We’ve got to bring counties back up, we’ve got to bring population back up, we need to do real economic development.” 
Xavier Carrigan, is also running for the Democratic nomination and spoke late Friday evening.
District 4: 
Ashley WolfTornabane and Stephanie Steiner are two of the Democratic candidates running for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, currently occupied by Republican U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who is running for Iowa governor. 
Steiner, a retired women’s health nurse and small livestock farmer from northwest Iowa, said her life has been shaped by rural America. 
Steiner said her vision includes “fair markets and fair prices” for farmers who want to compete in the market. 
“Fair markets aren’t radical, they’re the bedrock of a healthy farm community,” Steiner said. 
She advocated for a price floor for grain, mandatory country of origin labeling, enforcement of antitrust laws, greater availability of local processors and right to repair laws. 
Steiner also advocated for conservation incentives that “actually fit the scale of our Midwest family farms” to help fix Iowa’s problems with water quality.

“Stewardship is a core Iowa value, but policy must reward it,” Steiner said. 
WolfTornabane, a sixth-generation Iowan from Storm Lake running for the Democratic nomination, said Iowa politicians have “favored agribusiness instead of the family farmer.” 
“It’s time for a new machine,” WolfTornabane said. “We need federal law that protects farmers’ financial and physical health, as well as our precious precious resources of water, soil and wildlife.”
Former state Rep. Dave Dawson of Lawton is also seeking the Democratic nomination.
U.S. Senate:
Josh Turek, a state representative and two-time Paralympian, announced his intention to run for U.S. Senate in August. He joined a crowded field of Democrats running for nomination in the seat currently held by Ernst, who does not plan to run for reelection. 
Turek said he understands in a “deeply personal way” what a “great senator from Iowa can do for an individual, for state and for society,” he referenced former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, specifically his work for Americans with disabilities.

Turek compared himself to Harkin as a “prairie populist” and said rural Iowa can be summarized by hard work, community and resilience. 
He criticized President Donald Trump’s foreign trade policy and said farmers are being “betrayed and ignored” by the politicians in Washington. 
“We need representatives in Washington who will fight to strengthen our rural communities, protect our small farms and conserve Iowa’s most precious God given resource: our soil,” Turek said.
State Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, is also running for the seat, along with Nathan Sage and Bob Krause, who both spoke Friday. Republicans vying for a nomination include Hinson and Jim Carlin. 
Sage, a former sports radio host who grew up in Mason City, spoke against the current tariff policies, the lack of a farm bill, farmers’ inability to work on their own equipment and corporate support of politicians. 
Sage said rural Iowa needs broadband, more hospitals and economic development. 
“But more than anything, we need strong, midsize to small farms,” Sage said. “Those are the ones that power those rural communities.”

(Photo by Timothy Hurst/The Denver Post, Pool)Hundreds of mourners gathered on the west side of the Colorado Capitol in the brisk December air Friday to memorialize state Sen. Faith Winter, who died at 45 in a car crash last week.
Friends, family and colleagues remembered the Broomfield Democrat as an “altruistic” public servant who followed a steady moral compass during her career and life. More than anything, they spoke about her love for and commitment to her family and friends.
“It’s easy to see that she made an outsized impact in her short time. But to me, it’s not what she accomplished that’s remarkable, but it’s how she accomplished it — with empathy, humility and inclusivity,” Jessica Walker, a lifelong friend of Winter’s, said. “Kindness was her North Star.”

The memorial was attended by many current and former elected officials of both parties, including Gov. Jared Polis, members of the state’s congressional delegation and state lawmakers. Nearly everyone wore orange, Winter’s favorite color, or buttons that read “Lift As You Rise,” a nod to Winter’s ethos of creating better pathways and environments for everyone, especially women interested in public service.
“She knew that our state could be a better place, and she focused tirelessly on making it so,” Polis said. “When Faith was on your team, she was a fierce ally, 100% committed to the cause.”
Winter died in a multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 25 near Dry Creek Road on Nov. 26. The cause of the crash, one of two that occurred around the same time along the same stretch of the highway, is still under investigation. Her autopsy could take a month to finish.
Winter is survived by her two teenage children, Sienna and Tobin Snook. She was engaged to Matt Gray, a former Democratic state representative.
“My mom put so much love out into the world, which is why we feel her absence so strongly,” Sienna Snook said. “She didn’t need a reason for fighting to fight for others. She did because she knew that her voice was made for helping those who didn’t have one.”
Snook said that every night her mother would read her a “feminist story to show me to shoot for the moon.”

Elevating women’s voices
Speakers highlighted Winter’s public policy successes, including championing the successful ballot measure in 2020 that created a state-run paid family and parental leave program.
“She didn’t just win paid leave in Colorado,” said Dawn Huckelbridge, the leader of the national Paid Leave for All campaign. “She won it after fight after fight — after introducing it, after flipping the Senate and then taking it to the ballot for the very first time in this country, ignoring every naysayer and winning.”
Winter also sponsored a major transportation funding bill in 2021 that imposes fees on fuel, deliveries and ride-shares to fund transit and transportation projects. During this year’s regular session, she ran a bill to further protect reproductive health care access in Colorado.
As a representative in 2018, Winter alleged sexual harassment by fellow lawmaker Steve Lebsock, setting the stage for the House to expel him.
She became the assistant majority leader in the Senate in 2023.

Winter previously worked as the director of Emerge Colorado, an organization that recruits and trains women to run for public office. Many mourners spoke about Winter’s commitment to elevating women’s voices and helping them ascend to positions of power.
“Because she was only one person and only had so many hours in each day, she trained others on how to step up and do the work and build the bench that we needed to bring the change that she sought. And I was one of thousands who benefited from that,” said U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat who served in the Colorado Legislature with Winter and first met her in a fellowship program.
“She said ‘You should run for office,’” Pettersen said. “I immediately laughed and replied that people like me don’t run for office. And she said ‘Isn’t that the problem?’”
While many people spoke through tears about Winter’s life and legacy, the atmosphere was also celebratory. Speakers played upbeat music from artists including Taylor Swift and Kesha, two of Winter’s favorites, before and after the memorial service. Large photos of her with her two children flanked the podium. The steps of the Capitol were adorned with vibrant flowers, arranged by Rep. Jenny Willford, a Northglenn Democrat.
“She loved gerbera daisies and sunflowers because they were bright and bold,” Willford said. “They are cheerful blooms that match her energies — the kind of flowers that don’t shy away from the sun. They turn towards it, just like she did.”

(Photo courtesy of Gov. Brad Little's office)Idaho is planning to work with the U.S. Forest Service to significantly boost logging and timber sales from National Forest trees in the Gem State. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little and fellow Idahoan, Chief of the Forest Service Tom Schultz, on Friday announced the renewal of the state’s Shared Stewardship agreement with the U.S. Forest Service. 
 Agreement aims to reduce wildfire fuels through targeted logging 

The state and federal entity have had an agreement in place since 2018, but the new one comes with goals such as to roughly double current timber sales from National Forest land to 100 million board feet annually within five years. 
Little, Schultz and Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller emphasized Friday that the idea is to reduce wildfire risk. 
“This broader approach allows us to reduce fuels at a meaningful scale, protecting communities, improving forest health, strengthening local economies,” Little said Friday at a press conference. “… I deeply value our partnership as we work to prevent devastating fires, protect property and safeguard Idaho.” 
Schultz said the goals in the updated agreement align with President Donald Trump’s “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production” executive order issued in March that directs federal agencies to pursue ways to boost logging production and timber sales from federal lands. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Officials in the U.S. The Department of Agriculture, where the Forest Service is housed, are predicting a 25% increase in the volume of timber product sales over the next four years, Schultz said. 
The Forest Service is providing about $4 million upfront to ramp up the effort, he said, and the boosted timber sales are expected to cover ongoing costs. Other goals include working with private landowners to create fuel breaks and reduce fuels in areas where people live close to the wildland interface. 

The Idaho Department of Lands has developed a map of priority areas for logging and other fuel reduction, such as prescribed burns. Forested areas near McCall and in North Idaho around Coeur d’Alene and Sandpoint are among the primary focus areas. 
The agreement also includes plans to use the revenue from timber sales for fish and wildlife habitat restoration, tree replanting, and recreation improvements. 
Idaho is facing a projected budget shortfall of about $58 million for the current fiscal year, and a roughly $600 million deficit in the next fiscal year. Agencies are not expected to be able to increase staffing or request new employees during the upcoming legislative session. Miller said the state lands department has unique authority to be able to hire foresters to scale up activities if the income from it is sufficient.
Miller said the plan is to “bring on additional foresters to grow the program commensurate to the need.” 
 Schultz says Forest Service staffing is stable, conservation leaders worry it’s not enough

The partnership signed Friday will be executed by federal, state, tribal, and private land managers or forest owners.
Around 40% of Idaho’s land is forested, and nearly 90% of that forest land is owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Staffing at this agency was slashed in February amid mass layoffs as part of an effort by the president and then-advisor Elon Musk to cut back on spending. 
The Forest Service at the time cut around 3,400 positions, Reuters reported, or around 10% of its workforce. After a U.S. district court judge ruled in March that the mass firings were unlawful, the agency announced it would rehire many of the employees, Central Oregon Daily News reported.  
Asked Friday about how the staffing volatility might affect the agency’s ability to increase land management activities, Schultz said he wasn’t concerned. 
“Most of the resources that we have at the district and the forest levels have been pretty stable,” he said. “But we’re also leaning on partners. Partners being states and tribes and (non-governmental organizations) that help us do the work.” 
Idaho Conservation League Public Lands and Wildlife Director John Robison remained skeptical that the staffing situation is enough. Robison sits on the governor’s Shared Stewardship Advisory Council. 
“They have lost a tremendous amount of staff and expertise and institutional memory on the forest that’s needed to get this work done,” Robison said Friday in an interview. “… I appreciate the chief’s statements that the staffing decreases have stabilized, but they’re far short of what they need to be to accomplish the stated goals.” 
On Thursday, a group of Democratic U.S. Senators from mostly western states wrote to Shultz questioning if the Forest Service was doing enough to reduce wildfire fuels, Boise State Public Radio reported. The federal lawmakers’ letter came after an analysis from the advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Firefighters that found a nearly 40% drop in fuel reduction projects compared to previous years.

 Robison: New agreement can improve forest health, but must include public

Idaho and federal authorities have worked closely together since 2015, when the state implemented “Good Neighbor Authority” agreements to use state personnel and resources to assist with federal management. 
Little said the Shared Stewardship agreement uses the Good Neighbor Authority model and expands the cooperation across Idaho’s landscape, regardless of ownership. 
“Both models allow the state of Idaho, through our Idaho Department lands, to help get more work done on the ground,” Little said. 
Robison said that the collaborative approach to reducing wildfire fuels in Idaho has been largely successful. The challenge has been to ensure that timber activity doesn’t return to the “timber wars of yesteryear,” he said.  
He said a key component will be to avoid old growth trees. 
“There is an overabundance of small- and medium-sized trees on the National Forest in Idaho that wouldn’t otherwise be there, if not for decades of fire suppression,” Robison said. “And these overstock stands could actually benefit from some targeted thinning and prescribed fire. Those activities can both improve forest health and protect communities if they’re combined with hazardous fuel reduction efforts on private property.” 
Robison attributed Idaho’s success in this area to robust public participation. However, recent changes under the National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, may limit opportunities for public comment.
This summer, federal agencies, including the USDA, proposed regulation updates that include options to expedite environmental reviews and reduce or eliminate chances for the public to weigh in. 
“The public is in danger of being shut out from decisions made on our National Forests,” Robison said, “at a time when that is a core component for successful restoration and management.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/logging-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-05 19:56:46.313496

This story by Carly Ocasso was first published in The Bridge on Dec. 4, 2025.
One of the three finalists to become Montpelier’s next city manager is facing a $5 million lawsuit stemming from a decision he made at his current job. 
After hours of interviews and some procedural controversy, Montpelier’s City Council chose three finalists on Wednesday to replace former City Manager Bill Fraser: Pinole, CA City Manager Kelcey Young, Pitkin County, CO Commissioner Kelly McNicolas Kury, and Woodstock, VT Municipal Manager Eric Duffy.
However, Duffy is also one of the defendants in an active lawsuit filed in April by Woodstock Police Chief Joseph Swanson after Duffy demoted him. Duffy had placed Swanson on paid leave in October 2024, two days after a traffic incident involving a confrontation between Swanson’s husband and another driver, according to the Vermont Standard. 
In November, an “independent investigation by the Vermont State Police determined that no charges could be filed against either driver,” according to the Standard. The demotion was reversed by the court in December. But Duffy did not drop the matter and hired a private detective on Oct. 25 to investigate unnamed complaints against Swanson, according to the Standard.
Swanson responded in kind with a lawsuit against Duffy, the village trustees, Burgess Loss Prevention (the private investigator), the Town of Woodstock and the Village of Woodstock. The lawsuit claimed Duffy and the other defendants had acted unlawfully, maliciously, improperly and without cause, which damaged his reputation, according to court documents.
Still, Duffy told The Bridge his decision was warranted following a 14 hour hearing where the matter was discussed publicly.  “I am always going to do what I think is right and in the best interest of my staff, my community and the municipality, and if needed, hold people accountable for their actions or lack thereof,” Duffy said on on Thursday. “We believe he was unable to perform his duties as chief,” citing two no confidence votes — one from the police union and one from the dispatch union in November of 2024.
In Vermont, it is required to show proof  of “cause” to  remove a police chief from office, according to court documents. Village Trustees had unanimously supported Duffy’s decision to demote Swanson, but the court decision on Dec. 2 asserted the trustees did not show evidence of “cause” to do so. 
The village reasoned that a ‘for cause’ determination was not necessary because demotion was not equivalent to terminating employment. The court disagreed, stating that a demotion effectively removes one from office.
Duffy said that as a candidate for city manager, if he gets the position he looks forward to working with the community to co-create a place where people have enough housing and are able to thrive economically.  City Councilor Ben Doyle told The Bridge he was aware of the lawsuit during the hiring process, and that Duffy’s ability to face the situation head-on during the hiring process led him to believe Duffy is a man of integrity “who isn’t afraid to make hard choices.” Doyle also said he hopes community members keep an open mind and ask questions of all the candidates during the upcoming public forum.
An evening email to all Montpelier city councilors only yielded Doyle’s response. An email and phone message to Swanson’s lawyer were not immediately returned.

The layoffs include employees at Hoskinson Contracting and Hoskinson Concrete. The concrete company will close permanently.
The post Construction companies lay off 123 workers in Gillette appeared first on WyoFile .","Hoskinson Contracting and Hoskinson Concrete gave walking papers to a combined 123 employees this week, and an official with one firm said the concrete company will close permanently.
The number of workers laid off is significant, according to state officials, and beyond normal seasonal fluctuations in the construction industry.
Both companies are based in Gillette and founded by Charles Hoskinson, CEO and founder of Input Output Group. He also founded the new Hoskinson Health & Wellness Clinic on the south side of town. 
The construction and concrete companies were created to support the clinic, Hoskinson Contracting CEO Chris Davis said in a press statement.
“The large-scale construction needs that led the clinic to create an in-house construction company have come to an end,” Davis said. “As a result, Hoskinson Contracting is scaling back its operations, and the Hoskinson Concrete division is being closed.”
Every laid off employee will remain on payroll through January, according to a company spokesperson. Hoskinson Contracting employed more than 260 workers, according to its website on Friday morning.

Gov. Mark Gordon, in a statement Friday, described the situation as “one of the most significant layoffs Wyoming has ever seen.”
“This is tough news for more than [100] Wyoming workers who showed up, put their skills to work, and who now face job loss,” Gordon said. “I am deeply concerned for the hard-working individuals and families who now face uncertainty, especially during the holiday season.”
Wyoming Workforce Services has organized resources to reach out to affected employees and connect them to other employers in the region, as well as workforce training opportunities.
“We have offered to do a virtual event and to do something at our [Gillette] location,” Administrator of Workforce Programs Holly Simoni told WyoFile. “We’re trying to get specific contact information on these employees so that we can reach out to them and offer our services.”
Affected workers are encouraged to reach out to the Gillette Workforce Center, Simoni said. Job Seekers can look for employment and register at the HireWyo website.
Neither Gillette nor Campbell County elected officials were notified of the layoffs, according to WyoFile inquiries. Reached for comment Friday, Campbell County Commission Chair Kelley McCreery said he was unaware of the layoffs. 
“I do know [the companies] expanded really, really fast,” he said.
The county awarded Hoskinson Contracting a job earlier this year to install a boiler at the Northeast Regional Airport outside Gillette, according to McCreery, but the company asked to get out of the contract.
“They came back to us later and said, ‘We have lost some supervisors and we’re spread too thin, and we’d like to get out of the deal.’ So we let them out,” McCreery said.
Hoskinson Contracting will “work in a more limited capacity” going forward, according to Davis. “It will concentrate on maintaining existing Hoskinson properties and overseeing future construction projects, which it will bid out to local Wyoming contractors.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-05 23:41:52+00:00,Mississippi Today,New Orleans leaders call for transparency during federal immigration sweep,"Aliana Mediratta, Verite News",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/05/new-orleans-immigration-sweep/,New Orleans officials are demanding that federal agents be more transparent and humane during an immigration crackdown.,"New Orleans community leaders and politicians, including Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, U.S. Rep. Troy Carter and former Mayor Mark Morial, hosted a press conference Friday to demand that federal immigration agents deployed to New Orleans be more transparent and humane in their tactics. 
The press conference followed a letter sent earlier in the day by City Council to Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino with five specific demands for the recently-launched immigration sweep dubbed “Catahoula Crunch,” taking place in parts of Louisiana and south Mississippi. 
The council asked agents to report data including number of arrests made and criminal history of detainees, ensure due process, require officers to be identified and unmasked, disavow discriminatory stops and provide medical care and language services to detainees. 
The demands from the City Council come less than a week into the operation, which has led to widespread unease among New Orleans’ sizable immigrant population as individuals have been stopped, detained and even chased at their places of employment, homes and churches. 
“We stand here with an obligation to ensure that federal operations are conducted with transparency, constitutionally and with respect for local residents,” Moreno said. 
As anxiety over the operation continues to rise, multiple leaders spoke about the economic impact to New Orleans’ large hospitality and tourism industries, noting concerns of workers not showing up for fear of being detained or deported. 
Carter represents Louisiana’s 2nd District, which includes New Orleans. He decried any operations that create fear and confusion for families, workers and businesses. 
“We want federal partners, we just don’t want occupation,” Carter said. “We want them to work with us, not around us.” 
City Council members in New Orleans, a Democratic stronghold in a deeply Republican state, have grappled with the legal limitations of their power to push back against federal agents, in part because of laws and policies enacted by Louisiana’s conservative state government, such as a recently passed Louisiana law that prohibits interference with federal immigration agents. Moreno said that she felt they were requesting only basic transparency data, which she said she views as reasonable. 
The clash between local, state and federal officials continues as Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill posted a letter sent to New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, where Murrill wrote that she recommended Kirkpatrick order NOPD officers to cooperate with ICE. 
Earlier in the week, the council published a web page where people can anonymously upload footage that depicts any alleged abuses from federal immigration agents. The page also includes materials to educate people on their rights in English, Spanish and Vietnamese, which states that the NOPD will not ask people about their immigration status. 
Speakers at the press conference urged continued transparency and community collaboration as operation Catahoula Crunch moves forward. 
Council President JP Morrell pushed back against the reasoning behind the quota announced by Border Patrol — to arrest 5,000 people in New Orleans.
“I do not believe you are here for the reason you say you are here but you have an opportunity to prove me wrong,” he said in reference to federal immigration agents. “Provide this information that’s being requested by the New Orleans City Council. … Until then, this council will continue to use all the resources available to us, legal and otherwise, and make sure that the citizens of this city are protected.”

“All I can say is, it's clearly not based in science,” new state Health Commissioner Rick Hildebrant says of the federal change to the 30-year standard immunization schedule.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont health officials reaffirm importance of hepatitis B vaccine after federal advisory panel recommends delays.","A parent holds his 16-month-old daughter as she receives the Moderna Covid-19 vaccination in Salt Lake City, Utah, on June 21, 2022.

The federal panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine recommendations made one of its biggest moves on vaccine policy to date on Friday, saying that rather than vaccinate all newborns against hepatitis B at birth, parents and caregivers should delay the vaccine series until their child is 2 months old — if they choose to vaccinate them at all.
Vermont state officials are adamant that providers and families do not follow the panel’s recommendation and continue to give infants a dose at birth.  
Even before the decision from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, called ACIP, the Vermont Department of Health issued a public advisory to maintain its support for infants to be vaccinated within 24 hours of birth. 
“I’m concerned,” the state’s health commissioner, Rick Hildebrant, said in light of the federal panel’s decision. “The biggest concern I have is the confusion that this will cause.” 
“We sent the press release to make sure Vermonters know what our recommendation is, that it’s backed by science by 30 years of precedent, that it has been effective and safe in preventing chronic liver disease in folks,” Hildebrant said.
The federal panel voted 8-3 for the delayed vaccination. In June, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gutted the existing lineup of experts on the CDC panel and instead stacked the panel with many outspoken skeptics of vaccines.
The state recommends the birth-dose, followed by a series of vaccines for a child to complete by the time they are 18 months, as essential to prevent hepatitis B infections. The virus targets the liver and can lead to liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Though adults exposed to the virus are more able to clear it, 90% of infants infected develop chronic conditions.
Typically, the state Health Department buys the vaccines directly from the CDC at a low cost. That allows for easy distribution to the health care providers who administer the vaccines. Since the CDC panel’s recommendation delays, rather than entirely rejects, the vaccine, Hildebrant is not yet sure if or how this decision will alter the state’s ability to buy the vaccines and distribute them.
Kristina Massari, a spokesperson for BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont, said the state’s largest commercial insurer does not expect a significant shortage of vaccines in the coming year, since a recommendation is still partially in place. 
ACIP’s recommendation only applies to infants whose parent tested negative for hepatitis B while pregnant. The panel did not change the recommendations for those whose parents test positive, or those who do not test at all for the virus.
“Blue Cross VT is not changing its coverage of Hepatitis B vaccines,” Massari wrote in an email. “Members will have zero cost-share and will not be required to obtain prior authorization to receive this vital vaccination.”
Hildebrant said he and his colleagues are preparing to act, should they need to adjust the procurement and distribution pathways, though he is not sure what that would look like exactly. He worries about the added cost of buying the vaccines directly from the manufacturer and the logistics of needing to take on the distribution of them. 
Federal insurers will also continue to cover the vaccine, a policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Andrew Johnson, told the ACIP committee, as first reported by STAT, a health care news source.
“Not only do they care immensely about their insured individuals,” Hildebrant said of Vermonters’ insurance companies, “but they also know that this is going to save money. I mean, it’s very costly to not get vaccinated and then end up with a chronic illness. And that’s the least important part of this.” 
Since the CDC adopted the recommendation of a birth-dose in 1991, the United States saw a significant decrease in hepatitis B cases, dropping from a total of nearly 18,000 to fewer than 3,000 new diagnoses annually, a 2023 public health report found.
“You don’t get that kind of response rate in medicine with treatment,” Hildebrant said, becoming animated about the vaccine’s efficacy. “That is just remarkable. And the thought of going back to the days where we’re seeing 14,000 to 18,000 kids contracting hepatitis B across the country is not one that we’re excited about. It’s one we’re really, really concerned about.” 
Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, is one of Kennedy’s recent ACIP appointees. He has a history on the panel, having served under President Barack Obama between 2008 and 2012. He was one of the few dissenters in Friday’s meeting. 
“I will just say, we have heard ‘do no harm’ as a moral imperative. We are doing harm by changing this wording,” Meissner said as he cast his no vote during the panel.
The state health department echoed his concerns.
“There’s been a lot of incredible incredulity about this. ‘Why is this happening?’ And I don’t think anyone has a good answer to [the question of] why are people doing this,” Hildebrant said. “All I can say is, it’s clearly not based in science.”
The state Health Department has been coordinating and in frequent communication with counterparts across the region, according to Hildebrant. Following upheaval at the CDC this summer, Vermont joined a regional coalition to solidify more consensus as federal guidance contradicts consensus public health science.
Merideth Plumpton, the department’s Immunization Program manager, authored a Dec. 1 letter with more detailed guidance for providers and parents on the state’s recommended vaccination schedule, in line with that of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Hildebrant encouraged questions and skepticism of what best protects children from harm, but he encouraged parents to have these conversations with their children’s pediatricians. 
“Do not listen to a politician when it comes to health care decisions, please. These are decisions that belong in an exam room, and they are the people who are the best equipped to give you information about this.” he said.

""Montana Center for Christian Policy"" from the Montana Family Foundation Website. (Image via MFF website) A hard-right Christian legal advocacy organization is moving shop from Laurel to Helena, with the Montana Family Foundation announcing its plans to build the Montana Center for Christian Policy blocks from the capitol building.
According to publicly available data, a permit for 1339 11th Ave., was issued April, matching a site map the organization put in a news release. The permit is for a three-story building, the document says. 
When completed, the new policy shop for the Montana Family Foundation would be across from a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation building and down the street from the state’s new Heritage Center. The organization was previously based out of Laurel.
The Family Foundation did not respond to a request to speak with its leadership and lobbyist Derek Oestreicher, who loomed large during the session. 
In an email, the organization said the new building is, “located in the center of power in Montana” and will include a nonprofit incubator, offices for “Christian attorneys” and a policy and strategy center on its third floor.
“The Montana Family Foundation is a 25-year-old policy partner of Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, and Alliance Defending Freedom,” the organization said in a news post. “We advance pro-life, pro-family, and religious-freedom principles through legislation and litigation, grounded in a Judeo-Christian worldview and applied in the public square.”
The association with the Alliance Defending Freedom is notable, as one of its members is now on the Criminal Justice Oversight Council, in a position previously held by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The organization said it was a “several million dollar project” and did not specify a timeline in its newspost. The Montana Family Foundation is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit and its 2024 Form 990 said they brought in $133,000 in contributions and grants, down from the previous year, with the documents going on to say they ended the year -$56,538 in net assets or fund balances.
The Montana Family Foundation supported 47 pieces of legislation during the 2025 Legislative session seeing 22 of them pass. 
Great Falls Senator Daniel Emrich, Kalispell Senator John Fuller, Billings Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, and Belgrade Representative Caleb Hinkle, all Republicans, carried many of the bills the Family Foundation sought to pass. A number of those bills also came from known Montana Freedom Caucus members, including Sen. Carl Glimm, a Kila Republican.
They supported legislation that would make judicial races partisan, tightening voting rights, restricting or stopping access to abortions, favoring the display of the Ten Commandments in schools, banning mRNA vaccines, and calling for civil rights investigations into the Montana University System. The organization also supported a resolution against the U.S. Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision, which legalizing same-sex marriage, and a variety of laws targeting the state’s LGBTQ+ population.
“The bills that you lobby on as a lobbyist for the Montana Family Foundation and that Derek (Oestreicher) lobbies on, those are the at the heart of who the Montana Family Foundation is, those social conservative policy bills,” the organization’s executive director, Jeff Laszloffy, said on a recent YouTube podcast hosted by its lobbyists.
All three pieces of legislation it registered in opposition to failed — including SB 139, which would have eliminated a clergy exemption to mandatory reporting laws, meaning religious officials aren’t under any legal obligation to report child sexual assault.
“We question whether the bill is necessary,” Osreicher told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 28.
According to publicly available lists from the Catholic Church, 47 priests and sisters have been accused of sexual abuse in the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings and 20 priests have been accused in the Diocese of Helena. 
Pastor Tony Aaron Shaw, with Ruby Valley Baptist Church in Sheridan was found guilty of sexual assault against a child earlier this year. And in April of this year, girls who were sexually abused at Morning Star Baptist Church and at the Morning Star Christian Academy filed suit against a pastor — currently serving 30 years — and a church. The girls were around 12 years old at the time of the abuse.
“If everyone that could possibly help someone becomes a mandatory reporter, and there is no place to turn to to get help without winding up in jail, then in the end, they will turn to no one and continue harming children and themselves,” Osreicher told the committee in January.
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, a Helena Democrat, said she worked with the Catholic Diocese on language in the bill that would be acceptable to them, though the bill still failed. 
Dunwell also added that while she disagrees with many of their policies, their right to set up shop where they want isn’t a question.

Guy Federal Building pictured on Dec. 18, 2024, in Bismarck. (Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The operator of natural gas production facilities on the Fort Berthold Reservation was ordered Friday to pay a $500,000 fine and do 500 hours of community service for an environmental violation.
Targa Badlands LLC pleaded guilty earlier this year in U.S. District Court in North Dakota to a violation of the Clean Air Act that affected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. 
Targa, which operates six natural gas compressor stations on Fort Berthold, failed to install required hazardous air pollutant monitoring systems, federal prosecutors say in court records. 
The violation occurred between 2018 and 2022 on the Johnson Compressor Station near Mandaree. Natural gas gathering pipelines include compressor stations that boost pressure before the gas reaches a natural gas processing plant. 
The combustion engines on the compressor station produce hazardous air pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan O’Konek said during the plea hearing, according to a transcript.
The plea agreement indicates Targa self-reported the violation and promptly corrected it by installing monitoring equipment. The company has since taken steps to improve environmental compliance, federal prosecutors said. The attorney for Targa did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
In 2019 and 2021, Targa paid a total of $450,000 in civil penalties for similar violations involving compressor stations at Fort Berthold after reaching agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency, court records show. 
The additional $500,000 fine imposed Friday was the maximum penalty for the violation. U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor also ordered Targa to be on probation for three years, do community service work for the MHA Nation and pay a $400 fee. A plea agreement says the company should consult with MHA leaders before starting the community service work.
“Natural gas production is vital to our state’s economy, and it must be done responsibly,” North Dakota U.S. Attorney Nick Chase said in a statement. “This case demonstrates that we can support strong energy production while holding companies accountable when they fall short of their legal obligations.”
MHA Nation Chair Mark Fox said in a statement Friday that tribal leaders appreciate the community service aspect of the sentence, but no formal discussions have occurred about what that will involve.
“We are disappointed with the lack of consultation and are of the opinion that the fines should benefit our nation in some way,” Fox said.
Rep. Lisa Finley-DeVille, a Democrat from Mandaree who also chairs the Dakota Resource Council, said while she acknowledges the company self-reported the violation, it was the third of its kind, illustrating a need for stronger oversight.
“Energy development cannot come at the expense of our people,” Finley-DeVille said. “I will continue advocating for stricter safeguards, better monitoring, and full accountability so our communities receive the clean air and responsible operations they deserve.”

Newborn vaccinations have been critical to stopping the spread of Hepatitis B among Alaska Native children, McMahon said. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Western Alaska, where almost all the residents are Indigenous, used to have the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by Hepatitis B. After decades of screenings and vaccinations, that problem has been eliminated; since 1995, only one person under the age of 30 has been diagnosed with hepatitis-caused cancer.
Now the Trump administration is seeking to end one of the key tools credited with accomplishing that goal: Hepatitis B vaccinations of newborns.
The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Friday voted to drop a longstanding recommendation for universal hepatitis vaccines for newborns. That is in accordance with the controversial views of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who fired all members of the previous committee and appointed like-minded members to replace them.
Current federal childhood Hepatitis B vaccination guidelines recommend one dose of the vaccine at birth, followed by additional doses at intervals through 18 months. The recommendation for newborn vaccinations has been in place since 1991.
The advisory committee, part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, determined that children under 2 months should not be vaccinated unless their mothers are infected or could be infected by Hepatitis B.
Some vaccine critics in the administration, including Kennedy and President Donald Trump themselves, argue — contradicting medical experts and years of medical research — that Hepatitis B vaccines for young children are unnecessary, claiming that it is spread primarily or exclusively through adult behavior like sex and sharing of needles for illegal drug use.
“Hepatitis B is sexually transmitted. There’s no reason to give a baby that’s almost just born Hepatitis B. So I would say wait till the baby is 12 years old and formed and take Hepatitis B,” Trump said at a Sept. 22 news conference.
Those claims are false, said Dr. Brian McMahon, medical and research director of the liver and hepatitis program at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.
There is no credible evidence of  a link between the vaccine and autism of any other health problem, McMahon said.
And sexual transmissions accounted for only a tiny percentage of Alaska’s Hepatitis B cases, he said.
Aside from mother-to-infant transmissions, which occur during childbirth, Hepatitis B was predominantly spread in Western Alaska through normal daily activities. That is because, unlike the HIV virus or other hepatitis viruses, the Hepatitis B virus can live for seven days on surfaces in schools and homes, like tables and personal-grooming items.
“The virus can be found all over, on school luncheon tabletops, counters and homes,” McMahon said. “Kids have open cuts and scratches from bug bites or anything else, and then they shed millions of particles of the virus on environmental surfaces. And then another kid comes along with an open cut or scratch.”
Such risks are exacerbated in rural Alaska, he said, where homes can be crowded and people pursue traditional subsistence lifestyles with a lot of outdoor activities. 
“They’re hunting, fishing, cutting up meat, etcetera, and mosquito bites are real prominent,” he said.

	Nationally, only 12.6% of chronic Hepatitis B cases recorded from 2013 to 2018 were attributable to sexual transmission, according to a 2023 CDC study. Transmissions of all forms of hepatitis, including Hepatitis B, are possible through contact sports like football, rugby and hockey, researchers have found.
Alaska’s disease and vaccination success 
Before the past decades of vaccination and screening, Hepatitis B was so prevalent in Western Alaska that it was classified as endemic there. It was the only part of the United States with such a classification. In some villages, 20% to 30% of the residents were infected, McMahon said.
Geography and ancient migration patterns accounted for historically high rates of the disease in Western Alaska, as well as other Indigenous regions of the Arctic.
Various strains have been carried from Asia to Alaska over millennia, according to scientists. And the remoteness of Indigenous communities meant isolation from medical services, making early diagnosis difficult in the past, allowing infections to linger and be passed down through generations, according to scientists.
In Alaska, children infected with the virus early in life had a high likelihood of winding up with chronic infections that caused serious complications later, such as liver failure. The worst cases resulted in cancer, and even death.
For McMahon, now in his 80s, treating cancer-stricken children in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region, where he worked in the 1970s, was harrowing.
One of his patients was a 17-year-old high school valedictorian. A few months earlier, she started having abdominal pains, but she ignored them. 
“She was really busy with school, and she’d gotten a full ride scholarship and was excited about going to the University of Alaska, representing her community,” McMahon said.
The pains turned out to be cancer, caused by a hepatitis B infection that she had not known she had. Too sick to be flown home, she died in the Bethel hospital. 
“It was horrible,” McMahon said.
Another patient was an 11-year-old boy, also diagnosed after he complained of similar abdominal pain. McMahon visited him at home, where the boy was “in horrible pain” and yellow from jaundice. 
“He was just crying. He said I know I’m going to die. Just help me with my pain,’” McMahon said.
“My wife was with me. She was a public health nurse. She was in tears. The community health aid practitioner was in tears. I was fighting my tears and pulling everything I could out of my bag to try to help this patient sedate.  It was just something I’ll never forget. Never.” McMahon said.
He has relayed these and other experiences to the vaccine advisory committee in hopes of persuading members to keep the infant recommendations in place.
“I said, ‘Do you want to be responsible for children getting liver cancer because this decision?’” McMahon said. “So I’m probably not very popular right now.”
Alaska was one of the first places in the world where the Hepatitis B vaccine was used as soon as it became available in 1981.

	The pilot vaccination project was at the insistence of Alaska Native organizations, along with the state government and the Alaska congressional delegation. Under that pilot program, according to newly published study by McMahon and other researchers from the ANTHC and the CDC’s Arctic program, tribal health organizations and their partners screened 53,860 Alaska Native people for infection and gave vaccines to 43,618 Alaska Native people who tested negative, along with starting the universal newborn vaccinations.
Health officials have followed the outcomes since then, and the new study lists several achievements 40 years after universal newborn vaccination started.
Since 1995, according to the study, there have been no new symptomatic cases of Hepatitis B among Alaska Natives under 20 anywhere in the state. Since 2000, no new cases of hepatitis-related liver cancer have been identified among Alaska Natives of any age in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, a region where prevalence was concentrated in the past, the study said. And follow-up surveillance has revealed that childhood Hepatitis B vaccinations remain effective for at least 35 years, the study said.
Successes are also reflected in the trend of acute hepatitis, the form of infection that is short-lived and can be cleared from the body.
There have been no identified cases of acute hepatitis among Alaska Native children since 1992, according to Johns Hopkins University. The rate of acute hepatitis among Alaskans of all ages and ethnicities dropped from 12.1 cases per 100,000 people to 0.9 per 100,000 in the 2002-2015 period, according to the state Department of Health’s epidemiology section.
Alaska’s rate of chronic hepatitis B – the long-term and persistent infection that can lead to serious liver problems – remains higher than the national average. As of 2020, Alaska’s rate of chronic Hepatitis B was 14.2 cases per 100,000 people, nearly triple the national rate of 5 cases per 100,000 people, according to a report by the state Department of Health’s epidemiology section.
McMahon said that is partly because of the legacy of infections in the older Native population, people whose childhood predated widespread vaccination, and prevalence among foreign-born residents who come from countries without widespread vaccination.
Debate over Hepatitis B risks
This year, vaccine skeptics who are members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, however, along with people who are advising the committee, have argued that the risks of Hepatitis B among children are too low to justify universal infant vaccination.
One of the officials making that argument at Thursday’s committee meeting was Dr. Cynthia Nevison, a vaccine skeptic hired as a CDC consultant. She contradicted McMahon’s description of children spreading the virus through casual contact with contaminated surfaces – a process known as “horizontal transmission.”
“There’s very little evidence that horizontal transmission has ever been a significant threat to the average American child, and the risk probably has been overstated,” she said at the meeting. Also overstated, she said, are the risks of “vertical transmission,” the viral transmission between mothers and their newborns.
The committee’s new recommendation must be approved by the CDC administrator before it becomes federal policy.
McMahon said that no matter how national policy might change, Alaska Native tribal health organizations will continue administering Hepatitis B vaccines to newborns.
“I know they’re not going to stop. Even if they have to pay for it. They’re so aware of this,” he said.
His fears, he said, are for low-income families who depend on free vaccinations through state programs that might lose funding and for parents who are getting conflicting messages that may lead to conclusions that the vaccine is not necessary. 
“It could be a real mess,” he said.

(Courtesy of BorderPlex Digital Assets)Developers behind Project Jupiter, the controversial campus of data centers slated for Doña Ana County, have asked state environment officials to sign off on their plans to emit more greenhouse gases than the state’s two largest cities combined, and to generate as much electricity as the state’s largest power company.
Applications for air quality permits confirm figures that Source NM previously reported: If approved, Project Jupiter could emit more than 14 million tons of greenhouse gases per year. By comparison, Albuquerque and Las Cruces emit a combined 6.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, according to both cities’ climate action plans. The applications also say developers seek to install 41 turbines to annually generate about as much electricity as PNM.
Developers filed two applications, one for a “west microgrid” and one for an “east microgrid.” A microgrid is a self-reliant energy grid that doesn’t need to draw power from a larger utility, like PNM or El Paso Electric. For months, plans have made it clear that developers want to build natural gas generating stations for Project Jupiter’s microgrids, prompting concerns from residents and lawmakers that the data centers won’t comply with the state’s landmark clean energy law, which requires utilities to use 50% renewable energy by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2045.
The applications show that together, the microgrids will emit nearly 500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, an important ingredient in contributing to ozone. Individually, one microgrid is listed at 249.97 tons per year and the other at 248.9.
Environmental advocates say the developers’ proposal to split emissions across two permits for the same project appears to skirt state regulations, which classify projects with at least 250 tons per year of nitrogen oxides as “major sources” of hazardous air pollutants and subject them to arduous monitoring.
“They’ve split it into two separate plants that are ‘minor sources’ to avoid having to monitor their actual air quality impacts, which are going to be huge,” said Colin Cox, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “They’re coming up to 99.9% of the threshold for when they’d have to do additional work.”
The American Lung Association has long given Doña Ana County a failing grade for ozone, which can cause asthma attacks, increased risk of respiratory infections and even increased risk of premature death.
BorderPlex Digital Assets, the company that has represented Project Jupiter in public meetings, did not respond to a request for comment.
Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

The permits will only have to go through a public hearing process if an “outside party,” which can include a resident of the area, requests it, according to a spokesperson for the New Mexico Environment Department. No hearings have been scheduled.
Members of the public have, however, tried to stop the project in court.
In October, two residents and a local nonprofit filed a lawsuit against elected members of the Doña Ana County Commission and accused them of voting on an incomplete application when they approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds for the project in September. 
“We’ve seen this with other air permit applications, where they’re right under the limit,” Maslyn Locke, a New Mexico Environmental Law Center senior attorney who is representing residents in the case, told Source NM. “Ultimately that means everything has to go 100% perfectly as they operate to not violate that…I don’t know if that’s realistic.” 
Since filing suit in October, the nonprofit Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County has withdrawn as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
Another lawsuit, filed by Las Cruces resident Derrick Pacheco, alleged that county leaders acted inappropriately when they approved the project even though it had yet to go through the Planning and Zoning Commission.

Tony Evers vetoed nine bills Friday including a Republican bill that would have barred local and state funds from being used for immigrants without legal status.
Wisconsin already doesn’t allow immigrants without legal status to access BadgerCare, which Evers noted in his veto message. Republicans lawmakers acknowledged that fact as they advocated for AB 308, saying the bill was intended to block future use of health care benefits by immigrants. The bill would have prohibited state, county, village, long-term care district and federal funds from being used to subsidize, reimburse or provide compensation for any health care services for a person not lawfully in the U.S.
“As this bill’s Republican co-author in the Wisconsin State Assembly plainly stated in the public hearing on this proposal, ‘Wisconsin currently doesn’t allow undocumented immigrants to enroll in BadgerCare,’” Evers wrote in his veto message. 
“I object to Republican lawmakers passing legislation they acknowledge is unnecessary to prevent problems they admit do not exist, all for the sake of trying to push polarizing political rhetoric,” Evers added. 
Evers said the bill was “more about being inflammatory, stoking fear, and sowing division than it was about accomplishing any significant policy outcome or being prudent stewards of taxpayer dollars.” 
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, one of two Republican candidates for governor, criticized the veto in a statement, saying Evers was putting the interests of “illegal aliens” ahead of Wisconsin taxpayers and sought to tie Evers’ action to next year’s high-profile gubernatorial election. Evers is not running for reelection, and there is a crowded Democratic field that is still taking shape.
“If Democrats take the governor’s office in 2026, you can count on them to hand out driver’s licenses, in-state tuition and taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens. I will not let that happen,” Tiffany said.
No new cigar bars
Evers also vetoed a bill that would have allowed for more tobacco bars in Wisconsin. 
Wisconsin first enacted its smoke-free air law in 2010 — prohibiting smoking cigars, cigarettes, pipes and other products in public spaces. The law included an exclusion for cigar bars that were in existence before June 4, 2009.
AB 211 would have allowed for more exemptions for tobacco bars if they came into existence on or after June 4, 2009 provided that they allowed only the smoking of cigars and pipes and were not part of a retail food establishment.
Evers, a former smoker and an esophageal cancer survivor, said he objected due to the harm that the bill could have on Wisconsinites public health.
“Secondhand smoke, a known carcinogen, causes serious health problems and is responsible for thousands of deaths on an annual basis,” Evers stated. He said the state’s smoke-free air law was “a critically important step forward for keeping kids, families, and communities healthier and safer, improving public health and, most importantly, saving thousands of lives… I cannot in good conscience reverse course on that important step for public health, safety, and well-being by restoring indoor smoking in certain public spaces.”
Bill to ban guaranteed income
Evers also vetoed AB 165, which would have banned local governments from using tax money to create guaranteed income programs without a work or training requirement. 
Evers wrote in his veto message that he objects to lawmakers’ “continued efforts to arbitrarily restrict and preempt local governments across our state.” He said they should instead focus on finding ways to support local communities and ensure they have the resources they need to “meet basic and unique needs alike.”
Building code delay
Evers vetoed AB 450, which would have put off the effective date of Wisconsin’s updated commercial building code until April 1, 2026, saying he objected to “further unnecessary delay in implementing new building standards that will benefit Wisconsin communities.” 
The new building codes were originally blocked by lawmakers on the Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules for years, but they were reinstated this year by the the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) after a state Supreme Court decision. Justices ruled in July that state laws allowing the Legislature to block executive branch administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional.
The current effective date for the building codes is Nov. 1, 2025.
Republican lawmakers claimed the delay to next year was needed to provide clarity to builders who had been planning projects under the previous code. 
Evers wrote in his veto message that the bill would do the opposite. 
“This bill would not only create confusion for developers with current building projects under review but would also further delay the implementation of new safety and energy efficiency standards that have been already widely adopted,” Evers said. “The department has and will continue to work with building professionals throughout the state to ensure proper understanding and compliance with the new building commercial code.” 
Education bills rejected
A handful of Republican education-related bills were rejected by Evers. 
Currently, teacher preparation programs are required to have a full semester of student teaching during the school year. SB 424 would have allowed for programs to use student teaching during a summer session as an alternative to a full school-year semester.
Lawmakers had said the bill would help with recruitment by allowing for more flexibility to students seeking to become teachers. However, Evers said that the bill would potentially reduce the rigor of the current training that students are required to have, especially given that summer sessions can be shorter than a typical school term and may not allow students to experience the same opportunities available during the school year such as parent-teacher conferences.
“Reducing training, qualifications, experience, and work ages are not real solutions for solving Wisconsin’s generational workforce shortages,” Evers said in his veto message. “Wisconsin’s challenges recruiting, training, and retaining exceptional educators will not be aided by making education professionals less trained, less qualified, and less experienced — nor will our kids.”
Evers also vetoed AB 166, which would have required UW system institutions, technical colleges and private nonprofit colleges to report cost and student outcome data and required the information be provided to high school juniors and seniors in academic and career planning services. 
Evers said in his veto message that he didn’t want to burden the state’s higher education institutions with more administrative requirements, especially without “necessary resources.” He noted that the UW system says that the requirements in the bill “overlap substantially” with existing information that is already available. 
The University of Wisconsin system keeps a public dashboard with some of the information that the bill would have required, including for financial aid, retention and graduation, and time and credits to degree.
Evers also vetoed SB 10, which would have mandated that Wisconsin public school districts provide military recruiters with access to common areas in high schools and access during the school day and during school-sanctioned events. He said that while he supports the troops, he doesn’t support lawmakers’ attempts to “usurp” local control of decisions on when and where military recruiters are given access to schools. 
Bill that would have eliminated requirement for Elections Commission appeal
Voters currently can file a complaint to the Wisconsin Election Commission if they allege an election official serving the voter’s jurisdiction has failed to comply with certain election laws or has abused his or her discretion with respect to the administration of such election laws. A voter who doesn’t agree with a WEC decision can appeal to a court, though currently courts are only allowed to take up an appeal if voters have suffered an injury to a legally recognized interest as a result. That requirement was established in a 2025 state Supreme Court decision.
SB 270 would have eliminated that requirement, and Evers said he objected because it “would open the floodgates to frivolous lawsuits that not only burden our courts, but our election systems as well.” 
Penalties for those who falsely claim a service animal
AB 366, which would have allowed housing providers to require documentation for service animals and created penalties for misrepresentation of an animal. Evers said he objects to “the creation of unnecessary barriers for individuals with legitimate disability-related needs.”

The mental health program, which was funded by Congress after the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, included grants meant to help schools hire more counselors, psychologists and social workers, with a focus on rural and underserved areas of the country. 
In Connecticut, that included a five-year grant of $3 million for a program at the University of Connecticut’s Graduate School of Social Work. The funds were intended to support 25 graduate students in social work providing mental health services to students in Hartford, New Britain, Waterbury and Vernon. 
President Donald Trump’s administration opposed aspects of the grant programs that touched on race, saying they were harmful to students and told recipients they wouldn’t receive funding past December 2025.
[RELATED: CT sues Trump admin. over funds for mental health services in schools]
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, along with sixteen other state attorneys general, filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in July.
In October, U.S. District Judge Kymberly K. Evanson, ruled that the administration’s move to cancel school mental health grants was arbitrary and capricious.
The U.S. Department of Education and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon requested an emergency stay and on Thursday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied that motion.
The panel wrote in its decision that the government hadn’t shown it is likely to succeed based on its claims that the district court doesn’t have jurisdiction or that it will be “irreparably injured absent a stay.”
The grants were first awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. The Education Department prioritized giving the money to applicants who showed how they would increase the number of counselors from diverse backgrounds or from communities directly served by the school district.
The Trump administration said in a statement after the ruling in October that the grants were used “to promote divisive ideologies based on race and sex.”
The preliminary ruling by Evanson, a U.S. District Court judge in Seattle, applies only to some grantees in the 16 Democratic-led states that challenged the Education Department’s decision.

(Photo by Robert Stewart/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS — Local community leaders and politicians, including Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, Congressman Troy Carter, and former Mayor Marc Morial, hosted a press conference Friday to demand that federal immigration agents deployed to New Orleans be more transparent and humane in their tactics.
The press conference followed a letter sent earlier in the day by City Council to Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino with five specific demands for the recently-launched immigration sweep dubbed Catahoula Crunch. The demands asked agents to report data including number of arrests made and criminal history of detainees, ensure due process, require officers to be identified and unmasked, disavow discriminatory stops, and provide medical care and language services to detainees.
The demands from the City Council come less than a week into the operation, which has led to widespread unease among New Orleans’ sizable immigrant population as individuals have been stopped, detained, and even chased at their places of employment, homes, and churches.
“We stand here with an obligation to ensure that federal operations are conducted with transparency, constitutionally, and with respect for local residents,” Moreno said.
As anxiety over the operation continues to rise, multiple speakers spoke about the economic impact to New Orleans’ large hospitality and tourism industries, noting concerns of workers not showing up for fear of being detained or deported.
Carter, who represents Louisiana’s 2nd District — which includes New Orleans — decried any operations that create fear and confusion for families, workers and businesses.
“We want federal partners, we just don’t want occupation,” Carter said. “We want them to work with us, not around us.”

City councilmembers in New Orleans, a Democratic stronghold in a deeply Republican state, have grappled with the legal limitations of their power to push back against federal agents, in part because of laws and policies enacted by Louisiana’s conservative state government, such as a recently passed Louisiana law that prohibits interference with federal immigration agents. Moreno said that she felt they were requesting only basic transparency data, which she said she views as reasonable.

The clash between local, state and federal officials continues as Attorney General Liz Murrill posted a letter sent to New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, where Murrill wrote that she recommended Kirkpatrick order NOPD officers to cooperate with ICE.
Earlier in the week, the council published a web page where people can anonymously upload footage that depicts any alleged abuses from federal immigration agents. The page also includes materials to educate people on their rights in English, Spanish and Vietnamese, which states that the NOPD will not ask people about their immigration status.
Speakers at the press conference urged continued transparency and community collaboration as operation Catahoula Crunch moves forward.
Council President JP Morrell pushed back against the reasoning behind the quota announced by Border Patrol — to arrest 5,000 people in New Orleans.
“I do not believe you are here for the reason you say you are here but you have an opportunity to prove me wrong,” he said in reference to federal immigration agents. “Provide this information that’s being requested by the New Orleans City Council. … Until then, this council will continue to use all the resources available to us, legal and otherwise, and make sure that the citizens of this city are protected.”

Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday set special election dates to fill a vacant seat in House District 92, which was previously represented by Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City.
Bennett resigned effective Monday to lead the Oklahoma State AFL-CIO, a group of 230 labor unions representing over 100,000 workers. 
The dates the Republican governor set overlap with the 2026 general election dates, an election House District 92 was already set to be on the ballot for. The House seat will remain vacant during this upcoming session. 
Misha Mohr, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Election Board, said there will be a separate special election ballot. The regular primary for House District 92 will be on a regular primary election ballot. 
“Our interpretation of state law is that a candidate may run in both the regular and special election because, in this case, it is for the same office,” she said in a statement. “The candidate that wins the special election will serve the remainder of the unexpired term. The candidate that wins the regular election will serve the full term.”
Spokespeople for Stitt’s office did not return a request for comment by time of publication or answer questions about why these dates were chosen. 
Candidates seeking to run for the seat in the Oklahoma House must file between April 1 and April 3. 
The special primary will be held June 16. If a runoff primary is needed, it will be on Aug. 25. 
The special general election will be on Nov. 3. If a runoff is not needed, the general election will be held in late August. If a special primary is not needed, the general election will be on June 16. 
If voters elect the same candidate in both the special and regular election, the candidate will serve a full two-year term plus the remainder of Bennett’s term.
However, if two different candidates are elected in the special and regular election, the winner of the special election will only serve a few months.

“But if it doesn’t — and I hope these senators hear me right now when I say these words — if it does not pass, Turning Point Action is willing to throw more money and resources into these primary races than some congressional races,” Galaszewski said, as cheers rang out.
“We will throw so much money and resources into this state that no amount of money coming from a leadership (political action committee) will be able to offset it,” he emphasized.
Galaszewski spoke to Hoosiers gathered in the Statehouse for a Turning Point Action rally targeting reluctant Republican senators, calling Indiana “the last line of defense for us conservatives.”
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, who headlined the event, doubled down on his own threats.
Failure in the Senate, he said, “means you’re gonna have to clean house to get real conservatives in.”
Braun later told reporters that the Senate is “the place where things die for any good idea,” and described the chamber’s members as “out of sync with most Republicans and conservatives” in Indiana.

Some are already planning to challenge anti-redistricting incumbents. At the rally was Paula Copenhaver, a top aide to Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith who has launched a campaign against GOP Sen. Spencer Deery of West Lafayette.

Beckwith argued most Hoosiers support new maps. Several polls have found a majority do not.
“When you have the corrupt Indianapolis media telling you that the Indiana people don’t want it, they’re lying to you!” he exclaimed. “Hoosiers, overwhelmingly, … want this to happen!”
Speakers repeatedly pointed to “manipulated” maps in other Democratic states, primarily citing California and Massachusetts, as why Indiana should redistrict mid-census.
“They’ve been playing this game a long time,” said U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, a Republican representing Indiana’s 3rd District. “President Trump was nearly assassinated. Charlie Kirk … was assassinated in front of the entire world. They’re using bullets, my friend. We’re going to use the ballot box!”
Indiana’s seven-member Republican congressional delegation pledged support for redistricting in August, in the early days of the Trump administration’s pressure campaign. That included trips in August and October by Vice President JD Vance to meet with Hoosier leaders.
A few hundred supporters attended Friday’s event, where counter-protesters standing at the balconies overhead jeered  and chanted, “Cheaters, cheaters, cheaters!”
Attendees were encouraged to contact their senators — including at stations upstairs by the Senate’s Republican and Democratic entrances, where constituents could leave handwritten messages.

(Photo: courtesy of Siembra NC)Another large-scale immigration enforcement operation appears to be underway in North Carolina, focusing on the Research Triangle and Triad area, according to immigrant advocacy group Siembra NC.
In a statement Friday, Siembra NC said they received reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Morrisville, Apex, Durham, Greensboro, Charlotte and other locations this week. Some carried rifles and wore vests labeled “HSI Police” (Homeland Security Investigations is the investigative arm of ICE), while others wore masks and approached people in parked cars or pursued them on the road.
NC Newsline has not independently confirmed these reports.
Citing an unnamed source within the Department of Homeland Security, Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena said the group believes a monthlong ICE operation is underway in North Carolina involving at least 50 agents from other states. She said it’s the largest statewide operation in many years.
A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement earlier this week that she could not confirm any ICE activities. “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.”
The apparent ramp-up comes after heightened Border Patrol operations in November in Raleigh and Charlotte drew protests and led to the detention of some U.S. citizens. “Operation Charlotte’s Web” resulted in more than 425 arrests, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
“Even as workplaces, schools, and communities are still reeling from the devastating impacts of Border Patrol’s operation in November, this new monthlong operation by ICE is threatening a new wave of school absences, economic turmoil, and families ripped apart just a few weeks before the holidays,” Marín Baena said.
Ojo Obrero, an ICE activity tracker launched by Siembra NC in November, shows 10 reports in North Carolina in the past week, centered around the Research Triangle, the Piedmont Triad, and the Charlotte metropolitan area.
In Durham, at least three individuals were arrested on Dec. 4 and Dec. 5 on their way to interviews with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Siembra NC alleged, including a permanent resident set to interview to become a citizen and two mothers arriving for green card interviews.
The activist group laid the blame for the operations on North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall, quoting his comments last week that “ICE and CBP are doing a great job. We don’t have much to say to them except we just ask that they come back.”
Hall did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a social media post on Tuesday, condemned Siembra NC’s promotion of a “Destin Hall Pass” to stay home from work to avoid ICE.
“Looks like a far-left, pro-illegal group is now giving out a ‘Destin Hall Pass’ to help people skip work when ICE is in NC,” Hall wrote. “I’ve never seen a group of people so committed to breaking the law instead of keeping the public safe. Insanity.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Inc403_Greensboro.120425-1024x676.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 17:59:02.163189

Chiquita Moore, 41, was charged Thursday with theft and with tampering with public records. The ASP began investigating her in February at the request of Sonia Hagood, prosecuting attorney for the state’s 2nd Judicial District, which includes Clay, Craighead, Crittenden, Greene, Poinsett and Mississippi counties.
Moore resigned in August 2024 from her position as district court clerk in Earle, a Crittenden County city with fewer than 2,000 people. According to the 2024 report on Earle from the nonpartisan Arkansas Legislative Audit, the district court clerk’s office displayed “noncompliance with state law and accepted accounting practices.”
The report found financial discrepancies totaling $23,671 in bank deposits and receipts from the district court clerk’s office between January 2023 and August 2024. The validity of $11,935 in voided receipts “could not be substantiated,” according to the report, and $6,298 in receipts did not have adequate supporting documentation.
The remaining $5,438 in receipts “could not be traced to a bank deposit,” the report states.
Moore was taken into ASP custody and booked into the Crittenden County Detention Center on Thursday, according to the news release.
Law enforcement is also investigating Earle Mayor Jaylen Smith for alleged financial misdeeds, according to the audit report.
Audit staff could not substantiate documentation Smith provided them regarding $2,866 in hotel and fuel charges for an out-of-state trip, the report states. The city council approved the credit card charges in August 2024 but reversed its approval two months later because the city treasurer had not received adequate supporting documentation.
The report asserts that without the documentation, the expenses might conflict with Article 12, Section 5 of the Arkansas Constitution, which states, “No county, city, town or other municipal corporation, shall… obtain or appropriate money for, or loan its credit to, any corporation, association, institution or individual.”
As of Oct. 9, when the report was released, the city had not paid the credit card charges and Smith had not reimbursed the city.
Earle voters elected Smith at the age of 18 in 2022, making him the nation’s youngest Black mayor. He said earlier this year that he would run for a seat in the state House of Representatives in 2026, but he later decided to instead run for reelection as Earle’s mayor.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-4.03.32 PM.png,,,2025-12-05 17:59:02.163189

The review was prompted by a contentious election in Bennington County last year in which dozens of voters received the wrong ballots.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Audit finds more Vermont voters assigned to wrong state House, Senate districts .","MONTPELIER — An audit of local voter rolls prompted by the error-plagued race for a Vermont House seat in Bennington County last year uncovered 100 more cases across the state in which people had been assigned to vote in the wrong legislative district.
As a result, the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, which conducted the review, is calling for additional checks of town-managed voter rolls each time the state conducts the decennial process of redrawing legislative districts after the U.S. census count.
The number of Vermont voters assigned to the wrong district is low relative to the total number of people — about 373,000 — who cast a ballot in the most recent election. Officials from the secretary’s office said Friday they were not aware of any instances in which the results of a recent election would have changed because of voters who were in the wrong district.

The review was required by a law passed earlier this year and was published Nov. 20. It had all 24 Vermont cities and towns that span more than one district, for the Vermont House or Senate, review the checklists that prescribe who in town votes in which district.
Most Vermont municipalities are part of just one legislative district, meaning every voter there chooses from the same slate of state representatives and senators. But in the two dozen others, municipal and legislative district lines do not align so neatly. That means which candidates a resident sees on their ballot depends on where their house is.
That’s the case in the Bennington County town of Pownal, where some 50 voters were found shortly after the 2024 election to have been assigned to the wrong House district. The error stemmed from how a single street in town had been divided, during redistricting in 2022, between the Bennington-1 and Bennington-5 House districts.
Democrat Jonathan Cooper won the race in Bennington-1 over Republican Bruce Busa by fewer than 30 votes, calling into question if the error influenced the result and how the discrepancies should be handled. The full House later voted to affirm Cooper’s win, though several months after, it also passed the law requiring voter rolls to be audited.
The errors on Pownal’s voter rolls were corrected following the 2024 election. The 100 people identified in the latest report were in addition to those, the Secretary of State’s Office said. All of the newfound discrepancies have also since been corrected.
According to the audit, three other municipalities made “minor errors” putting the 2022 district maps into effect. In Burlington, the state’s largest city, 26 out of about 29,200 total voters had to be moved to another House district, the review found. Meanwhile, Colchester and Williamstown had to move five and one voters, respectively.
The audit also found “data integrity issues” related to voters’ records that were either formatted incorrectly or included incomplete information. For instance, a voter may have listed their apartment number on a line meant for the number of their street address, meaning they were assigned to a voting district on the wrong side of the street. 
As a result of those data issues — many of which predated even the latest decennial redistricting process — 68 more voters across 12 different municipalities had to be moved into a different district after the audit, according to the secretary’s office.
In all, that meant more than half of the towns in the state that encompass multiple districts needed to move at least one voter as a result of the audit.
Lauren Hibbert, Vermont’s deputy secretary of state, said inaccuracies on voter rolls are unavoidable and that the office was expecting to find a small number of them. She said the results of the audit should not make people feel less confident in the integrity of the state’s elections because many of the errors were a result of data being entered incorrectly, almost certainly by accident.
She also characterized the findings as an example of the joint oversight of elections between local and state officials working as it should.
“I think Vermonters can feel very comfortable that their town clerk is aware who is on their voter checklist. And, when you take that across all of our towns, that the statewide voter checklist is very well maintained,” Hibbert said in an interview.
She added that the office’s relatively new election management system, which it rolled out earlier this year, has safeguards that would likely flag similar errors in voter data entry going forward. The system also makes it easier for the office to run reports looking for errors in its statewide database that includes all voters, Hibbert said.
Vermont’s election data, and similar data in other states, has come into the crosshairs in recent months due to efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration to collect details on voters across the country. The White House has indicated that it wants the data to crack down on fraudulent voting and identify instances, which data shows are rare, of non-U.S. citizens voting in state or federal elections.
The Vermont Secretary of State’s Office denied a request in August from Trump’s Department of Justice to hand over voter data. On Monday, the Trump administration sued Vermont to force the state to comply.
Vermont’s Republican Gov. Phil Scott said at a press conference Wednesday that he supported Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas’ decision to withhold the data, which could include voters’ dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and Social Security numbers.
The secretary’s office had no additional information on the lawsuit as of Friday, Hibbert said.

(Photo by Ryan Murphy/Getty Images)Louisiana’s top criminal justice official has warned New Orleans’ police chief she risks breaking state and federal laws if her officers don’t actively support ongoing federal immigration enforcement efforts in the city.
Attorney General Liz Murrill sent a letter Friday to NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick saying the department’s policies “conflict with current state law and also may be interpreted as ‘sanctuary’ policies.” (Read the letter below)  
The letter comes as hundreds of agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have converged on New Orleans and the surrounding area for what the Department of Homeland Security has labeled Operation Catahoula Crunch. The Trump administration has said the campaign, similar to those elsewhere in the country, targets the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.” 
Federal officials have so far identified fewer than 10 people detained in its New Orleans-area sting as having criminal records, and it has not reported how many total have been taken into custody. In comparable ICE and Border Patrol operations in other areas, only a fraction of those arrested have had criminal backgrounds.
The attorney general sent her pointed message to Kirkpatrick as agents continued their roundups, which have included immigrants with legal residency status and people mistakenly targeted.  
“At this time, I recommend that you immediately direct NOPD officers and staff to fully cooperate with ICE and CBP,” Murrill wrote in the conclusion of her letter.
In an emailed statement, an NOPD spokesperson said Murrill’s letter has been received and was under review. 
“NOPD will continue to follow all state and federal laws while staying focused on public safety and maintaining the trust of our community,” Kirkpatrick said in the statement.
Murrill’s letter said NOPD employees would be committing malfeasance in office under state law if they adhere to policies that require them to refuse cooperating with ICE. In addition, they could be charged with a federal felony if they knowingly conceal or withhold information about someone being in the country illegally. 
In the letter, Murrill cited policy in the NOPD Operations Manual that bars NOPD officers from assisting federal immigration authorities except in limited instances. These include when there is a threat to life or safety, when executing a court-issued warrant or order, and sending or receiving citizenship status information to and with ICE.
In an interview with WBOK-AM last month, Kirkpatrick said the NOPD would not take part in any “removals” but during federal immigration sweeps would assist agents “if they need help because of safety.” 
The superintendent has also described the immigration efforts as civil matters, as opposed to criminal. Murrill challenged that stance in her letter to Kirkpatrick. 
“There is no absolution in suggesting that immigration enforcement laws are a ‘civil issue,’ and, on that basis, NOPD cannot assist or support ICE and CBP in their enforcement efforts,” the attorney general wrote. 
Murrill also noted a state law approved in 2024 that prohibits cities from adopting “sanctuary policies” that are contrary to immigration laws, adding that she has the authority to sue any local agency that puts any such ordinances or rules in place.
The attorney general is challenging the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which operates the city jail, in federal court over its refusal to honor detainer requests from ICE or share information with the agency on the immigration status of people in custody. The sheriff’s office policy has been in place since 2013 as part of a settlement in a federal case involving two immigrant construction workers who were kept in jail at ICE’s request after they had completed their sentences for minor offenses.
The NOPD’s policy is linked to a 2013 federal consent decree meant to address the department’s history of corruption and unconstitutional police practices. It included measures to curb racial profiling, which potentially impacts how immigration enforcement is conducted.    
But less than two weeks before federal agents launched their operation in New Orleans, a federal judge terminated the consent decree at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice and city leaders.    
The Trump administration has acted to quash similar federal oversight agreements for police departments in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, arguing they are too far-reaching and limit the ability of law enforcement to tackle crime.

AMES — Iowa legislators discussed food policy priorities, including the Choose Iowa program, food education efforts and support for food insecure individuals Friday at the Iowa Local Food Summit.
The summit, led by Iowa Food System Coalition and Iowa Farmers Union, included panels with state agencies and Republican and Democratic legislators on local food policies. 
The discussions at the summit centered on supporting Iowa food producers, addressing issues of food insecurity in the state and the places where those two issues intersect.

Food insecurity 
About 12% of Iowans are food insecure, according to data from Feeding American. But food security advocates project recent federal changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will make it more difficult for the state to support food-insecure households. 
Iowa has also enacted its own changes to food assistance programs. In January, Gov. Kim Reynolds’ plan to stop SNAP recipients from purchasing sugary drinks, candy and other items, goes into effect. This summer, the state opted to carry out its own summer feeding program for food insecure children, rather than follow the federal summer feeding program. 
State Sen. Annette Sweeney, R-Iowa Falls, said these programs allowed for greater localization of food assistance. 
“Our local individuals working in the food pantries, they see the need,” Sweeney said. 
With a state-led program, she said, these local individuals are able to advocate for changes and adjustments to a program so they can best serve their recipients. 
Rather than loading money onto SNAP Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards on a per-child basis as the federal program operates, the state program partnered with food banks to instead distribute $40 worth of food, per child, to households. 
Erin Drinnin, the division director for community access and eligibility at the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, said during a panel earlier Friday that the state is still waiting for a finalized evaluation report of the Healthy Kids Iowa program. 
Preliminary feedback from the evaluation, according to Drinnin, showed that parents “really liked the program” but food banks and distribution sites reported there were “lots of operational challenges” due to the amount of food they had to move in a short period of time. 
Reynolds, speaking with reporters outside of her Terrace Hill residence Nov. 25, said the state is still “looking at all options” with the program to decide how it will proceed next year. 
Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, opposed the state’s summer program and said a return to the federally led program would allow for more consumer choice. 
“People who are on SNAP buy the same groceries that you and I buy,” Wessel-Kroeschell said. “Sometimes we buy a treat, but not always … So I strongly support the SNAP program, the Summer EBT program, I hope we someday are participating in it also.”
Local food policies 
Choose Iowa, the state’s marketing program for locally grown and raised products, represents a crossover between efforts to address food insecurity and to support local food systems. 
Rep. Norlin Mommsen, R-DeWitt, was one of the legislators wh helped push the Choose Iowa program through the Legislature and later advocated for the program’s purchasing program with local food banks. 
This year, the state agriculture department was allotted $200,000 to issue as matching grants to Iowa food banks for the purchase of locally grown food. 
Mommsen said Choose Iowa, which now has more than 300 members across more than 80 of Iowa’s counties, has helped to “cultivate more food produced in Iowa.” 
The food bank purchasing program, he said, also helps Iowans connect to locally grown food so that when they no longer need food assistance, they will “still recognize the Choose Iowa label, and then choose that food or try and connect with that food later.” 
Choose Iowa also had a pilot program that granted funding to Iowa schools for the purchase of locally produced food. This program did not receive permanent funding in the latest agriculture appropriations bill. 
Mommsen said when it came to creating the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship budget for the year, it was simply a “dollars issue” that led the program to go unappropriated.
Haley Hook, the legislative liaison for IDALS, said in a panel earlier at the summit the department hopes to permanently codify the school purchasing program so that a future allocation could be more easily made to the program. 
Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, said the state budget will be tight in the upcoming legislative session and he is “not hopeful” any budget or program will be expanded this year.
“We’re going to be clawing to hang on to what, minimally, we have right now,” Zimmer said. “So to me, if we could just fund Choose Iowa at where it’s at now, I would call that a success.” 
Food education
Zimmer, who has spent his career in education and currently serves as a career and technology education consultant in eastern Iowa, said he sees support for local food procurement at schools as “key” to keeping Iowans fed. 
Zimmer said those programs have to be supported, because as much as local schools want to purchase locally, they cannot afford to purchase locally without any assistance. 
Sweeney said she plans to, again, file a bill to require a semester of food education in Iowa schools. These classes, she said, would teach things like canning, gardening and food preparation, all skills she said “are gone.” 
“So that’s a bill I’m going to run this year to hopefully have people understand more about their food, where it comes from, and then to be able to buy our local foods and know how to fix it,” Sweeney said. 
Zimmer agreed with his colleague and said the loss of these skills has coincided with an increase in purchasing highly processed, high-calorie food items. He said he would love to see a class like this, but from his experience, trying to find educators for these classes is “a tough go.”
“You can have the most beautiful program and (be) well equipped but if you don’t have a teacher, you have nothing,” Zimmer said. “And we do not have teachers going into that field … we’re in the crisis on the education portion of it.” 
Amid all of the hardships facing local food and food security efforts in the state, lawmakers said they are encouraged by the creativity of Iowans in these fields and from everyday Iowans who have stepped up to support one another. 
“If you are always … gonna wait for the government to do it, don’t,” Mommsen said. “Because just look at, (as) we were talking earlier, there was funding in these areas, and now they’re gone. So I would use creativity, and then whatever the government helps, that’s gravy.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 21:51:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Will widening I-95 in Stamford help traffic? CT DOT is considering it,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/i-95-widening-lanes-ct-dot/,"The agency will hold a pair of public meetings next week regarding the future of I-95, including an in-person forum at Ferguson Library.","As part of an effort to alleviate traffic on one of the nation’s most congested stretches of interstate highway, the Connecticut Department of Transportation is weighing a fix that has roused local opposition: adding more highway.
In October, the agency delivered a presentation to a committee made up of Stamford residents, business leaders and other local groups unveiling several concepts for a planned overhaul of Interstate 95 through the city’s downtown. One option called for widening the interstate by a single lane in each direction. Another suggests putting up a “collector-distributor” road running parallel to the highway.
A third option presented by the DOT would avoid adding any new travel lanes, and focus instead on reconfiguring the highway’s exits and entrances, as well as adding wider shoulders.
Those proposals were pitched as part of DOT’s long-term study of ways to improve traffic and safety on I-95 between exits 6 and 9, a bottleneck that is well known to Connecticut drivers for producing chronic delays. In addition, the DOT is looking to replace a bridge carrying the highway over local roads and the Metro-North railroad tracks, which is outdated and in need of replacement. 
But some local advocates who had been following the DOT’s work said they were caught off guard by the proposal to widen the highway, which they described as an outdated — and thoroughly debunked — solution to the city’s traffic woes.
“I basically told them that this was pretty bonkers to me,” said Angelo Bochanis, a resident of downtown Stamford who is a member of the local advisory committee that heard the DOT’s proposals in October.
“It felt very out of step with everything we were talking about and the direction I thought this project had been headed,” Bochanis said. “There’s been a national conversation around reconnecting communities that have been adversely impacted by highway construction. I thought CTDOT was really cognizant of that.”
In an interview Friday, DOT officials involved with the study cautioned that the concepts presented at the October meeting were only preliminary and that the agency has yet to settle on a specific plan for the highway.
“We’re early in the planning process for what is the future of I-95,” said Jonathan Dean, the project manager for the DOT’s study. The ideas under consideration at this point, he said, are “all being compared against each other, they’re being compared against, ‘What is the no-build alternative? What if we didn’t do anything other than what’s required just to maintain the highway as it is?'”
The agency has not conducted cost estimates for any of the proposals for I-95 in Stamford, Dean added, nor have detailed designs been produced showing which properties adjacent to the highway may need to be cleared for construction.
A DOT spokesman said that some additional information regarding costs and property impacts could come about as part of the next and final phase of the screening process, before the agency issues its final recommendations late next year. More details, however, won’t be known until those recommendations go through subsequent environmental reviews and design.
“Some will be long-term projects that may not begin for several years,” the spokesman, Josh Morgan, said in an email. “At the same time, we’re working to identify smaller, independent projects that can be done in the next five years.”

The agency will hold a pair of public meetings next week regarding the future of I-95, including an in-person forum on Dec. 10 at Stamford’s Ferguson Library. 
The idea of widening the highway has attracted support from some drivers and businesses, including thousands of commercial truckers that traverse I-95 on a daily basis.
John Blair, the president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, a group representing the trucking industry, pointed out that I-95 in Stamford is one of several locations in the state that perennially rank among the nation’s worst bottlenecks for truckers. (MTAC is also a part of the project advisory council for the I-95 study.)
In addition to the economic costs of having trucks stuck in traffic, Blair said that jams also make highways less safe for drivers.
“There’s a lot of breaking and swerving and traffic and congestion down there,” Blair said. “I think anything they can do to widen it and widen the other spots in Connecticut will help not only the trucking community, but certainly cars and automobiles and passenger vehicles.” 
In its current configuration, I-95 has three travel lanes in each direction through Stamford. The DOT is currently constructing a pair of auxiliary lanes between exits 6 and 7 in order to allow drivers more time to merge onto the highway.
Traffic along I-95 is expected to worsen significantly over the next few decades, according to DOT. By 2050, peak travel times through the 3.2 mile stretch of downtown Stamford are expected to grow by nine minutes in each direction, assuming no major renovations to the highway are made.
Critics of highway widening, including multiple researchers who have studied the topic, argue that it does little to reduce congestion in the long term. The culprit, they say, is a phenomenon known as induced demand. Additional lanes may produce some temporary relief from traffic jams, the theory goes, but other drivers alter their routines to take advantage of the new space — and soon traffic becomes as bad, or worse, than it ever was.
“There are very few examples in this country, if any, where just one more lane solves that problem,” said Peter Harrison, the director of Connecticut programs at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the tri-state area. “I think DOT is smart enough to know that.”
Harrison said that while the RPA has yet to take a position on the state’s proposals, the group generally favors other methods — such as public transit or congestion pricing — to reduce congestion. New York City rolled out the nation’s first congestion pricing program earlier this year, charging drivers a variable toll to enter the busiest sections of Manhattan.
Bochanis pointed out that it can take him more than 45 minutes to travel from his home in Stamford to Norwalk by bus, a distance of less than 10 miles. Bochanis said he does not own a car, which makes him more reliant on transit.
“Unless we start talking about creating viable alternatives to driving along the 95 corridor, there’s always going to be traffic along 95,” he said. “There’s no amount of expansion, no amount of homes you can demolish that will fix that.”
Zach Oberholtzer, another member of the project’s advisory committee, echoed those critiques of the DOT’s planning. Oberholtzer is also an organizer with People Friendly Stamford, an advocacy group that supports mass transit and efforts to reduce car dependency.
“The problem with I-95 traffic is that the trains run too slow,” Oberholtzer said. “If you want to move people efficiently, if you want to move stuff efficiently, you want to put people and stuff on rail… They have no new, insightful, creative solutions here. It’s just the same, ‘Well, what if we added another lane?’ and we know that doesn’t fix it.”
Mass transit options are not a part of the study looking at an overhaul of I-95 in downtown Stamford. But Dean, the project engineer, said DOT as a whole is considering all modes of transportation in its long-term planning for the area. In addition, he said the study will look at the design of local streets next to the interstate for ways to improve bike and pedestrian access.
“It’s a very built up area,” Dean said. “There are a lot of access points to and from the interstate, but that’s something that we’re looking at: How does it all work together, and what can we improve?”‘
Gov. Ned Lamont has pledged billions of dollars as part of an effort to speed up train service along Metro-North Railroad’s New Haven Line, though much of that work is unfinished and the results have only shaved a few minutes off commutes so far. Earlier this year, DOT had to raise rail fares in order to plug a budget shortfall and continue operating at existing levels. (Bus fares remained flat this year, at $1.75.)
Some lawmakers have also raised concerns that the state’s Special Transportation Fund — which covers some of the costs of highway and transit infrastructure projects — could run out of money by 2030, while the Lamont administration is arguing that the state needs to curtail its borrowing for transportation projects. 
Morgan, the DOT spokesman, said that no funding has been dedicated to any projects that might arise from the ongoing study of I-95 in Stamford.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/I-95-stamford-e1764960181186.jpg,,,2025-12-05 16:57:38.988467

A former Orange County Sheriff’s deputy has been permanently banned from working as a law enforcement officer in Vermont nearly three years after he was sentenced to jail following his criminal convictions in a road rage case. 
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council voted at its most recent meeting last month to take the action against William Pine, according to Christopher Brickell, the council’s executive director.
The action appears to bring a close to proceedings stemming from the road rage incident that dates back to 2019.

The matter before the council last month had been set for a contested hearing, but Pine did not attend, and the council members voted to approve the measure, Brickell said Friday. 
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council oversees the certification, training and standards of police officers in the state.
Pine could not be reached for comment.
The incident leading to the council’s action against Pine dates back to Oct. 7, 2019. That’s when, according to court records, Pine, who was off-duty at the time, was driving a Nissan Titan in Williamstown. 
Charging documents stated that Pine had followed a Jeep Wrangler on Stone Road for several miles and eventually performed a “tactical maneuver” at the intersection of Route 64 in an attempt to block the Jeep. 
A prosecutor told jurors during a later trial in the case that Pine then yelled at two men who were in the Jeep, “Deputy sheriff, don’t F-ing move.”
Then, court records stated, Pine fired shots into the Jeep, shattering the Jeep’s rear window as the vehicle fled toward Interstate 89.
The Orange County Sheriff’s Department had initially placed Pine on unpaid leave after the incident. Following the jury’s verdict, the department terminated him.
Asked Friday why it took so long for the case to reach the council, Brickell replied that it was due to several factors, including awaiting the results of the criminal matter and then PIne’s imprisonment. 
In addition, according to Brickell, attempts to resolve the matter with a negotiated agreement rather than setting a contested hearing was complicated by difficulties contacting Pine, who had since moved out of state.

John Morley, a longtime village of Orleans employee and former state representative, will fill Orleans County’s vacant seat in the Vermont Senate. 
Gov. Phil Scott announced his appointment in a press release on Friday.
Morley replaces Sam Douglass, who resigned in scandal this fall when his involvement in a national Young Republicans group chat replete with racist and bigoted messages was revealed in a Politico exposé. Top Vermont Republicans, including Scott, quickly called for the former senator to step down.

The Caledonian Record this week reported four people considered to replace Douglass, including three current members of the Vermont House: Rep. Mark Higley, R-Lowell; Rep. Michael Marcotte, R-Coventry; and Rep. John Kascenska, R-Burke. (The report also indicated Marcotte had removed himself from the selection process.)
Morley’s name was not on the reported list, though Scott, in a statement, appeared to allude to the sitting House members he’d considered.  
“I also want to acknowledge how difficult this choice was, with three strong, capable, and effective state representatives from the Kingdom sent by the County Committee for my consideration,” Scott said. “All three are invaluable leaders in the House, in important roles at a critical time during the biennium. I look forward to continuing to work with them on our shared priorities.”
Morley, who works as the Orleans village manager, could not be immediately reached for comment late Friday afternoon. He previously served six years in the Vermont House, ending his tenure in 2010, according to a press release from Scott’s office.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The shot clock has been reset on the imminent closure of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital under another extension brokered between attorneys for Rhode Island and the hospitals’ bankruptcy estate.
The agreement presented to a federal bankruptcy judge in Dallas Friday gives prospective buyer The Centurion Foundation until the end of January — rather than Dec. 31 —  to line up the investor-backed financing needed to complete the sale. If Centurion can’t pull it off, the hospitals could be placed under state-controlled receivership.
“Centurion has continued to work this issue, we believe very hard and in good faith,” said Andrew Troop, a New York attorney hired by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office to represent the state in federal bankruptcy proceedings. “They will work like expletive deleted to get this done.”
Ben Mingle, Centurion CEO, reiterated that the foundation is “aggressively executing” its financing strategy with the intent of closing the sale in January.
“We want to acknowledge the support of Attorney General Peter Neronha and his team, as well as the Department of Health, who agreed to this extension of time and to cover any losses through the month of January,” Mingle said in a statement Friday. State leaders have been instrumental in their support of our plan and the importance of these hospitals to the local community.”
Neronha was still skeptical.
“I’m no cheerleader for anybody,” he said in a call with reporters after the court hearing Friday. “They’ve got to put up or shut up.”
The Atlanta nonprofit lined up conditional state regulatory approval to buy the struggling hospitals from their now-bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, in June 2024. But Centurion has been unable to lure investors to back the bonds needed to secure its purchase, much to the dismay of Rhode Island health care leaders, the federal bankruptcy judge and Prospect’s many creditors. 
Prospect’s bankruptcy estate in October sought to close the hospitals by the end of the year, rather than keep racking up monthly operating costs and postponing resolution of the 11-month bankruptcy case. 
But Centurion signaled it needs even more time; Mingle said in a court filing on Monday that the bonds being underwritten by Barclays and Bank of America should close “on or about Jan. 15.”
Neronha on Friday acknowledged that Centurion is the only buyer that has already cleared the extensive state regulatory approval process, and agreed to meet a host of conditions critical to preserving hospital operations, workers and services to patients.

No longer Primed for purchase 
That’s in contrast with Prime Healthcare, which Gov. Dan McKee’s administration courted as an alternative buyer for at least several months. Neronha confirmed Thursday that Prime had walked away — at least for now — unable to reach a resolution with state regulators on the conditions and financial investments expected.
Neronha offered more detail Friday on where talks broke down.
The national hospital chain operator, which owns Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, was unwilling to cover the $91 million in hospital labor costs, local taxes and a federal loan repayment that Prospect’s creditors — and Neronha — expected a buyer to cover. Prime also refused to commit to keeping service and staffing levels the same, and wanted a $5 million monthly management fee in exchange for running operations, Neronha said.
Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, confirmed the company had decided not to move forward with an acquisition of the Rhode Island hospitals but declined to comment on details of its negotiations.
Centurion has already agreed to cover the bankruptcy costs and maintain existing service and staffing levels. It has not sought management fees from the state, Neronha said.
Neronha blasted Rhode Island Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Charest, former Landmark CEO, for exposing the state to legal action by soliciting Prime when Centurion was still under exclusive rights to buy the hospitals. Neronha also blamed Charest for making his job as a state regulator more difficult.
“I can’t negotiate with Prime if Prime believes the state will welcome them unconditionally to ownership of these hospitals,” Neronha said. “I’ve got to negotiate on behalf of Rhode Island. It’s very difficult to do that if the Secretary is taking away my bargaining leverage by telling them they can have the hospitals for whatever they want.”
Neronha also said Prime’s press statements, featuring complimentary quotes from Charest, told him “everything I need to know” about the relationship between McKee’s cabinet member and the hospital owner.  










I can’t negotiate with Prime if Prime believes the state will welcome them unconditionally to ownership of these hospitals. I’ve got to negotiate on behalf of Rhode Island.

Ashley O’Shea, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services, said Charest’s conversations with Prime were “contingency planning” and not formal negotiations on an offer.
“When Centurion was having difficulty closing the transaction, it became apparent to the McKee administration that it was in Rhode Island’s best interest to explore back-up options in case Centurion was not able to close the transaction,” O’Shea said in an emailed response Friday. “Secretary Charest has remained focused on fulfilling the governor’s directive to preserve these hospitals — whose closure would be catastrophic for Rhode Island’s already strained health care system.”

Avoiding catastrophe 
Preserving the pair of safety net hospitals — with 500 beds, 50,000 annual emergency room visits and nearly 2,500 employees between them — has been a shared priority among companies, state leaders and even Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
“Even though as a bankruptcy judge I am about debtor or creditor rights, you cannot help but feel some responsibility for these human beings,” Jernigan said Friday. 
Jernigan has had harsh words for Centurion in past hearings, questioning why it has been unable to close the sale over the last year of bankruptcy proceedings. But she expressed support Friday.
“I feel much better today than I have in the past hearings,” she said, adding that she was “content to let the process play out.”
For now, that process hinges on Centurion securing the investor-backed bonds to close a sale by mid-January. A timeline Centurion submitted to the bankruptcy court shows a meeting with investors scheduled in Boston on Dec. 15, with documents finalized and agreements executed by Jan. 5.
“Centurion recognizes that this transaction has taken longer to close than anticipated, and it acknowledges that the court approved the sale in February 2025 and is focused on preventing further administrative drain and ensuring a realistic, near-term path to closing.” Mingle wrote in a Dec. 1 affidavit to the court. “Centurion takes these concerns seriously.”

– Ben Mingle, CEO of The Centurion Foundation 


Neronha on Friday said he is solely focused on getting Centurion “to the finish line.”
This includes forking over another $6 million from a state-controlled escrow account to cover hospital operations through Jan. 31. The state already has spent $6 million from the account funded by the facilities’ former owner, private equity firm Leonard Green, to cover operating costs in November and December.
The fund will still have $37 million to $42 million left after January’s expenses, with Centurion — or an alternative buyer — required to replenish the money spent on recent operating costs. 
Closure remains a possibility if Centurion can’t come through on its pledged commitment by the end of January, Neronha acknowledged. An alternative: a court-appointed state receiver, though details of the transfer of the hospitals to a state trustee have not been solidified.
“We’re a long way away from that point now,” Neronha said. 
McKee MIA?
Neronha suggested McKee’s office and the Rhode Island General Assembly could contribute state money to keep the hospitals afloat longer, mimicking actions taken by Gov. Maura Healey in Massachusetts last year after Steward Health Care filed for bankruptcy and sold off its Massachusetts hospitals.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday on whether he plans to offer state funding for the hospitals.
“Keeping these hospitals open remains our top priority,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email Thursday. She also noted that nothing prevents Prime from “reengaging” if the Centurion deal does not go through.
Senate President Valarie Lawson and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also have not publicly committed to spending state budget funds on the hospitals though they are monitoring developments, Greg Paré, a spokesperson for Lawson, said Friday.
Helena Buonnano Foulkes, who is challenging McKee for the governor’s seat in the 2026 Democratic primary, criticized McKee and other unspecified “state leaders” for their poor performance.
“They have failed to personally convene key stakeholders and leaders of Rhode Island’s health care system or present any contingency plan,” Foulkes said in a statement Thursday. “This lack of leadership is unacceptable when two hospitals, thousands of patients, and hospital workers hang in the balance.”
Brad Dufault, a spokesperson for the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents 1,500 workers across both hospitals, maintained the union’s stance that Centurion’s offered the best hope of survival. The union has been critical of Prime for its trio of federal settlements over Medicaid and billing fraud, and its allegedly poor relations with union members at Landmark in Woonsocket.
“With time running out quickly, the UNAP is pleased that the state can now keep the focus 100% on closing the Centurion deal,” Dufault said in a statement Friday. “The deal is our best immediate option to keep these important community hospitals open and operational into the new year and beyond.”

(Getty Images)A federal appeals court has rejected a late Delaware woman’s challenge to the residency requirement in New Jersey’s assisted suicide law.
The three-judge U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled Friday that assisted suicide is not a fundamental privilege the state must extend to residents from other states. Striking the residency requirement would expose doctors to criminal prosecution, risk inter-state conflicts, and undermine anti-coercion safeguards in New Jersey’s law, they said.
“A prescription lawful in Camden can be evidence of a felony in Philadelphia,” Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote for the panel. “If a New Jersey doctor prescribes a Pennsylvanian lethal pills and she swallows them back in Pennsylvania, the doctor might reasonably fear prosecution.”
Antiabortion pregnancy centers take case against NJ to US Supreme Court

In New Jersey, doctors can prescribe self-administered medication to terminally ill New Jersey adults expected to die within six months so they can end their lives.
Before a doctor can prescribe the medication, a patient must make one written request and two oral requests separated by at least 15 days.
The suit was brought initially by Delaware resident Judy Govatos, Philadelphia resident Andrea Sealy, and two New Jersey doctors.
One of the doctors retired during the litigation. Sealy died before a lower court upheld the residency requirement. Govatos, who had late-stage lymphoma, died in November after oral arguments were held in the case, leaving Paul Bryman, a New Jersey doctor, as the case’s only plaintiff.
“I am deeply disappointed by today’s ruling,” Bryman said in a statement. “Terminal patients outside New Jersey should have the option of medical aid in dying without having to travel long distances.”
New Jersey’s Medical Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act, which passed in April 2019, was controversial, with critics raising ethical and religious objections while supporters said people with terminal illnesses deserve to choose when they would die.
Bryman argued the law’s residency requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s privileges and immunities clause, which requires states to protect the fundamental rights and privileges of out-of-state residents within their borders.
But those protections do not require New Jersey to guarantee all privileges to residents from other states, the court ruled in its precedential opinion. Assisted suicide — a relatively new practice legal in only 12 states and Washington, D.C. — does not qualify as a fundamental right, the judges said.
“There is no longstanding tradition of doctor-assisted suicide. On the contrary, there is a centuries-long tradition against it,” Bibas wrote.
For the same reasons, the law does not violate the Constitution’s equal protections clause, the panel said.
New Jersey’s law “aims to keep both patients and pills in-state” to avoid exposing Garden State doctors to prosecution in other jurisdictions and avoid causing discord with states where assisted suicide is illegal, the court ruled.
Other states also lack laws barring insurers and others from pressuring patients to go take the medication once they have obtained it, which would undermine protections in New Jersey’s law, the court said.
“New Jersey’s justifications are weighty, rooted in real dangers of extending doctor-assisted suicide to nonresidents,” Bibas wrote. “And its response is well tailored to further those justifications.”
The court rejected claims that the law infringes on federal authority over interstate commerce, finding the statute is not commercial in nature.
The Office of the Chief State Medical Examiner reported 409 people died through the program between August 2019 and the end of 2024, including 122 last year.
“Despite this decision, access to medical aid in dying remains a critically important option for all terminally ill people who wish to receive health care in the state of New Jersey,” said Jess Pezley, an attorney with Compassion & Choices, a Colorado-based nonprofit that represented the plaintiffs.

Temperatures remain bitterly cold across Vermont after extreme cold hit the region on Thursday.
Tyler Danzig, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Burlington, said temperatures dropped into the negative teens on Thursday night, with negative 20s across the central and northern areas of Vermont. Wind chills reached -25 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of Caledonia County and -13 degrees at the Burlington Airport.
The extreme cold on Thursday was mostly due to the previous snow, which kept ground temperatures cool, and wind chills, according to Danzig. But the National Weather Service didn’t issue a cold weather advisory because only some areas in the Northeast Kingdom reached the threshold of -20 degrees Fahrenheit.
These temperatures are not uncommon for Vermont in the winter, Danzig said, but he still recommended people to cover their face in higher winds to avoid frostbites, wear several layers of clothes and make sure pets are inside.
The Office of Economic Opportunity at the Department for Children and Families has recently created a new Extreme Cold Weather Shelter Program, in partnership with Vermont Interfaith Action, to support people experiencing homelessness during periods of extreme cold.
The program will operate from Dec. 1 to April 1, when temperatures reach at least -10 degrees, with projects in Bennington, Burlington, Newport, Rutland, Barre, Montpelier and Brattleboro, Lily Sojourner, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, said.
The shelters in Barre and Brattleboro opened for the first time Thursday night and provided relief for 26 people, according to Sojourner. Sojourner said this program is just one of many others operating this winter, including the General Assistance Emergency Hotel Program and seasonal shelters across the state.
Tess Taylor, homeless and housing liaison for the city of Barre, said the shelter at the Congregational Church also hosted people in need on Thursday. The space has a capacity of 12 people and will continue to operate when temperatures are around zero, providing food, cots and blankets, Taylor said.
“Low temperatures tonight will fall into the single digits across much of Vermont, with temperatures in the Northeast Kingdom around five to 10, then across the central portions of Vermont around 10 degrees,” Danzig said. 
Monday night temperatures might get lower again, he added.

Former Rep. Rick Martin, a Newberry Republican, must complete an anger management class in the next six months or spend 30 days in jail, a Newberry County judge decided Tuesday.
Martin was charged in 2021 with misconduct in office and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Prosecutors said he gave alcohol to a 15-year-old and called the then-director of the Department of Social Services to threaten his job and agency budget, The Post and Courier reported at the time. Martin was accused of making a similar call to an agency lobbyist.
Both charges were dropped this week and replaced with a single count of unlawful communication, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 days in jail and a minimum fine of $100, according to court records. Martin will have to pay $128.75 in court fees.
Martin was suspended from the House as soon as the charges against him were announced in 2021.
He still ran for re-election the following year but placed last in a three-way GOP primary won by Joe White. The retired businessman joined the hardline Freedom Caucus after he easily won the general election that November with no Democratic opponent. White was re-elected last year to the seat representing Newberry County and one precinct in Lexington County.

It joins other financial aid programs offered by the college, including the full-tuition Iowa Access Initiative for students coming from households earning less than $100,000 annually, according to the release, and the $20,000 Founders Scholarship for all admitted resident students.
According to the college’s website, 92% of Grinnell College students receive financial aid, and 100% of “demonstrated need” is met by the college without requiring students to take out loans.
Grinnell College Dean Ruth Feingold said in the release that the university “brings bright, engaged students from around the world to live and learn in Iowa” and fosters a campus where students can join the intellectual community and learn from more people than just their teachers.
“Our new Iowa Dean’s Scholarship is our way of extending a clear welcome to high-performing students from our home state: come join us here,” Feingold said in the release.

Interim President Donald Landry and UF trustees expressed a commitment during a board meeting to “institutional neutrality” regarding how university actors will behave.
“We are not protecting the right to choose topics for classroom instruction, research, or scholarship if that right is not coupled with institutional neutrality,” Landry said. 
“We have to provide protections for free expression, but we are not going to be able to engage in that protection if we have leadership speaking on issues that then create those aligned with leadership and those opposed to leadership. At that moment, those who are opposed to leadership are now afraid to speak, they don’t know if it’s safe.”

Trustees unanimously supported a policy that applies to university employees with access to communications resources used for “university business,” including email distribution lists, university websites, social media accounts, and teleconference systems. 
“University business” encompasses “instructional activities, research and scholarship, administrative functions, communications,” and lobbying. Also: “Guidance regarding or requiring compliance with laws, regulations or policies.”
“Proclamations from UF institutional and unit leadership on issues that polarize society impair the free and open exchange of differing ideas on campus as it divides the student body and faculty into those aligned with leadership and those opposed,” the new policy says, in part. 
The policy, according to its language, “clarifies expectations regarding (1) leadership commentary and proclamations on Social Issues; (2) the use of communication resources for personal expression; and (3) representations of affiliations.”
“When our leaders make comment or proclamations on social issues, political issues, normative issues, current events to their university constituents, these statements divide our faculty and students, chill free expression for those who do not agree with leadership, and send a signal that suddenly there’s no room for open discourse or the contest of ideas at the University of Florida,” Landry said. 
Landry said he met with deans at the school about the neutrality statement. 
“We resist ideological takeover of any unit of the university, we reject ideological indoctrination in favor of open discourse, we accomplish that at this university and in this state mainly through the right of the students to record any lecture,” Landry said. 
The policy allows “political or social advocacy” as long as it’s not represented as UF policy, protecting “personal expression in their private capacities.”
Violation of the policy could result in termination.

“What we’re going to accomplish today is the voluntary restraint of leadership not to speak. If speech must come forth, it will come forth from the president in consultation with the chair, but otherwise we will remain silent,” Landry said. 
Earlier in the meeting, Landry laid out his vision for the university. He holds the position while the university searches for a president. The search started Friday, and Chair Mori Hosseini said Landry signaled he will apply for the permanent position.
“This is a state where individuals can come confident that they will be able to learn, confident that their education will not be disrupted. It is a state where faculty can come, knowing they will be able to teach, they will be able to do research, they will be able to do their scholarship. That stability is priceless. That’s a firm foundation for a vision of preeminence and leadership,” Landry said. 
The DeSantis administration’s political involvement in higher education led various professors to express their desire to leave the state, the Phoenix reported earlier this year.
Landry spent much of his time outlining his vision for the university, talking about expanding and supporting artificial intelligence research. 
Chairs
Hosseini, a major donor to Gov. Ron DeSantis, will serve another term as chair of the state’s flagship university; the trustees unanimously voted Friday to keep Hosseini in charge for another two years. 
Mori Hosseini via UF
Hosseini has served on the UF board since 2016 and before that he served on the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees public universitites, on which he also was chairman. 
Notably, Hosseini stood behind the UF trustees’ support for Santa Ono, even after the state Board of Governors rejected him to be the leader of the university. Prominent Republicans came out in opposition to the former University of Michigan president after he abandoned his previous support for diversity, equity, and inclusion policies that are anathema to the MAGA movement. 
“It’s no exaggeration to say that, in the modern era, I don’t think anybody has had as much influence on the trajectory of the University of Florida than you. From inspiring and challenging our leadership, to leveraging your relationships in Tallahassee for the benefit of our institution, the impact of your work is visible to all of us, every day,” board Vice Chair Rahul Patel told Hosseini. 
The board also voted to keep Patel as the board’s vice chair.

Carla Cunningham, the Democrat who faced a jeering hometown crowd this summer after delivering a controversial speech on the state House floor criticizing immigrants, is seeking an eighth term. 
She’ll likely be in a crowded primary field in House District 106 in Charlotte. 
The Rev. Rodney Sadler filed campaign paperwork on Monday. 
At least two others say they plan to run. Morris McAdoo, a lawyer, has a campaign website. Vermanno Bowman, whom Cunningham defeated in last year’s primary, announced on social media he also plans to run again. 
Cunningham worked for decades as a nurse and has been a prominent voice in the legislature on health and mental health matters.
She is the widow of longtime House member Pete Cunningham, who resigned his seat in 2007 and died in 2010. Carla Cunningham won her first term in 2012.  
Cunningham has emerged as one of the Democrats who votes most often with the Republican majority. This year, she voted with Republicans more than any other Democrat. And Republican House leaders have recognized that by awarding her coveted positions in chamber leadership: she co-chairs the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, and is a vice-chair of the House Health Committee.
But, until now, she has not faced a concerted Democratic effort to oust her. She defeated Bowman in last year’s primary with more than 84% of the vote. 
House District 106 is heavily Democratic, so the primary victor is likely to win the seat. 
Cunningham delivered her controversial speech on immigration as she voted with the GOP to override Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of House Bill 318. The law puts more requirements on law enforcement to help U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement with deportations. 
“All cultures are not equal,” Cunningham said in a speech explaining her vote to override Stein’s veto. Immigrants need to assimilate, she added. 
At an August town hall filled with angry Democrats, Cunningham defended her vote and the speech, WFAE reported. 
Last month, the U.S. Border Patrol began an operation in Charlotte that triggered a wave of fear that temporarily closed businesses and had parents afraid to send children to school.
Cunningham was initially dismissive of reports of the operation. She told NC Newsline, “I’m going to be keeping my eyes on my own safety for right now,” saying she had received threats over her July speech.  
However, in an email Friday announcing her reelection bid, Cunningham said her vote was about serious criminal offenders.

Kelly Armstrong set Jan. 21 as the tentative date for a special legislative session to allocate federal rural health funding.
In a Friday letter, Armstrong notified legislative leaders of the likely special session date, but said it’s contingent on North Dakota receiving its federal funding award.  
North Dakota and other states applied in November for their share of $50 billion through the Rural Health Transformation Program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to award funding to states by Dec. 31. 
A North Dakota legislative committee gave input on the state’s application, but lawmakers will still need to meet and give final approval for spending those federal dollars.
North Dakota lawmakers build wish list for $500M federal rural health care grant

“We have an incredible opportunity to strengthen and reshape rural health care in North Dakota through the Rural Health Transformation Program,” Armstrong said in a statement. “I appreciate the collaboration with legislative leadership and look forward to a special session laser-focused on the task at hand – appropriating these federal dollars in the most efficient and effective way possible to improve the well-being of our citizens.”
In a letter to House and Senate leaders, Armstrong defined the purpose of the special session as allocating the rural health funding. But once lawmakers convene, they will be able to run the session as they see fit, said Mike Nowatzki, spokesperson for Armstrong.
“He’s not able to limit them,” Nowatzki said.
Senate Majority Leader Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, said Legislative Management will meet the week before the special session to “set the table,” but the intent of legislative leadership is to limit the focus of the session to the Rural Health Transformation Program funding.
“But, of course, folks could introduce other things,” Hogue said. He added anything introduced by lawmakers would likely require a two-thirds majority in each chamber to be considered, which is a high bar.
Hogue said the tentative Jan. 21 date for the special session was chosen because it gives the Department of Health and Human Services as much time as possible to implement the funding after it is awarded at the end of the year.
John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, said the shortest amount of time a special session can last is three days because each chamber cannot vote on the first and second reading of a bill on the same day. 
North Dakota’s Legislature is limited to meeting 80 days every two years. Because Armstrong is calling the special session, Bjornson said the Legislature will retain its six remaining legislative days to use before the 2027 legislative session.
States are expected to get at least $500 million from the federal grant, but states could be eligible for more based on certain factors, including if they implement some health-related policies. North Dakota’s application focuses on boosting the state’s rural health workforce, preventive care and healthy eating, bringing health care closer to home and connecting technology and data.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island has taken “an important step forward” with the official completion of demolition of the westbound lanes of the Washington Bridge, Gov. Dan McKee’s office announced Friday. 
The news arrives a few weeks ahead of the original demolition schedule and less than a week shy of the two-year anniversary of the span’s sudden closure on Dec. 11, 2023. State officials initially said the westbound span would be removed by the end of the year. 
“I know travelers are still feeling the frustration of traffic, and I want to assure them that we are fully committed to rebuilding this bridge as quickly as possible, with one of the nation’s top bridge builders leading the work,” McKee said in a statement Friday. “We thank Rhode Islanders for their patience as we construct a new, safe bridge that will improve traffic flow and shorten commute times.” 
In July 2024, demolition crews began to remove the bridge in two parts, starting with the bridge deck and superstructure in July 2024. Work paused in mid-September 2024 to allow state investigators to document its condition as part of the state’s lawsuit against 13 firms that previously worked on it before resuming on Oct. 11, 2024. 
At the end of January, a video of debris falling into the Seekonk River near the Providence side prompted concerns from local residents. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation said the demolition posed no dangers to the eastbound span and that only a small amount of debris had fallen into the water. Officials worked with state coastal regulators to coordinate the removal of debris from the river.
In March 2025, substructure demolition began, with the removal of underwater portions starting in July. 
The final phase of the substructure removal was completed in the first week of December, according to McKee’s office, ahead of the end-of-month timeline that had originally been set. 
State contractors will now focus their attention on the replacement bridge, which is tentatively scheduled to open in November 2028. The Chicago-based Walsh Construction was awarded the construction contract in June 2025. The agreement has a base price of $339 million, but the total could climb to as much as $427 million, with incentives and contingencies.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Most people of Somali descent in America are citizens, including those living in Minnesota, according to estimates from the American Community Survey, an ongoing survey conducted by the Census Bureau.
Immigration enforcement agents have increased their presence in Minnesota in recent days as part of a targeted campaign ordered by President Donald Trump to deport undocumented Somali immigrants. ICE has arrested at least 12 people this month, including 5 from Somalia, in what it calls “Operation Metro Surge,” according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security release.
Apart from Minnesota’s biting cold this week, one complication in Trump’s plan to deport Somalis from Minnesota through immigration enforcement is that the vast majority of Americans and Minnesotans of Somali descent are U.S. citizens, many of whom were born here.


Exact numbers on citizenship of Somali-Americans are unknown. The American Community Survey, which extrapolates its monthly sampling of selected households to the larger population through a weighting process, indicates that around 22,000 Somalis in America — 8.4% — are not citizens. In Minnesota, around 5,000 people of Somali descent are not citizens, according to ACS. That figure includes people here through other legal means, such as permanent residents, green card holders and the couple hundred covered by Temporary Protected Status, a protection Trump said he would end earlier than planned.
That number has decreased significantly since the start of the century. According to ACS data from IPUMS, a database housed at the University of Minnesota, over 78% of people with Somali ancestry in America weren’t citizens in 2001, about a decade after the start of a Somali Civil War created a worldwide diaspora.
In Minnesota, the number of Somali non-citizens went from over 76% in 2001 to 9% in 2023. In the same period, U.S.-born people of Somali descent rose from 19% to nearly 39% of all Somalis as families settled here and had children.
Estimates for how many people of Somali descent live in the country and in Minnesota vary by source and time. The decennial census, which is sent to all households every 10 years, estimated in 2020 that there were around 91,000 Somalis in Minnesota and 221,000 Somalis nationwide. The American Community Survey estimated that in 2024, there were around 108,000 residents of Somali descent in Minnesota and 259,000 in America.
The numbers could be off by around 10,000 to 20,000, and the precise number of Somalis in the state and country is unknowable. Still, all estimates indicate that Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the country.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Close to half of South Dakotans aren’t up-to-date on their flu shots or their hepatitis B vaccinations, new vaccine survey results released by the South Dakota Department of Health indicate.
About 63% aren’t up-to-date on their HPV vaccinations, which protect against most cases of cervical cancer, and 78% aren’t up-to-date on their pneumococcal vaccinations, which help protect against pneumococcal infections.
That’s “concerning” to Keith Hansen, president of the South Dakota State Medical Association. Vaccinations are “one of the most important developments in health” to keep people and communities healthy, he said. 
As a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist, he is especially concerned with how vaccine-preventable diseases can affect pregnant women and newborn children. 
“It’s really sad when someone isn’t vaccinated and then they come into the hospital because they caught a vaccine-preventable disease,” Hansen said. “Now they have some bad outcome that could have been prevented.”
The state Health Department conducted the survey to better understand vaccination behaviors, decision-making and awareness of the vaccine schedule. A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant funded the survey.
COVID pandemic influences some vaccine behavior
More than a quarter of survey respondents said the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted their views on vaccines. Those respondents also had lower vaccination rates for the flu and COVID, at 34% and 4%, respectively.
Most South Dakota vaccine survey respondents said their views on immunizations haven’t changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But nearly 28% said their views became more negative because of the pandemic. (Courtesy of the South Dakota Department of Health)
Among all survey respondents, 96% reported ever being vaccinated. About 98% of respondents with children reported that their child had received at least one vaccination.
About 96% of respondents said they get at least “some” vaccines recommended by their doctor, and nearly 93% of respondents said they follow the routine or a delayed vaccination schedule for their child.
Carmen Toft, director for South Dakota Families for Vaccines and board vice president of Immunize South Dakota, said the state should “celebrate” those positive statistics.
The goal, Toft said, is to reach vaccination rates above 95% to reach herd immunity, which is when the prevention of infectious diseases becomes most effective.
Tdap vaccinations remain high
While most vaccination rates in the survey are lower than Hansen or Toft prefer, up-to-date Tdap vaccination rates were highest among respondents at 78%. The vaccine protects against infections caused by diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.
Among respondents who said their vaccination views were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 75.5% of adult respondents were up to date on their Tdap vaccination.
That could be because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adults get the Tdap booster every 10 years for adults, Toft said, rather than yearly like the flu. If vaccine hesitancy rises, Tdap vaccination rates could be impacted more slowly than more regularly recommended vaccines.
Hansen added that Tdap vaccinations are sometimes administered in response to injuries, such as cuts, to prevent tetanus. Also known as lockjaw, tetanus causes muscle contractions and can be life-threatening.
Conflicting information could lead to more vaccine hesitancy
The most common reasons respondents gave for not receiving vaccinations included hearing contradictory information — from doctors, social media, news outlets, government agencies and others — and believing a vaccine isn’t safe or isn’t needed.
Concern about vaccine safety was the most common reason respondents gave for choosing not to vaccinate a child, followed by the belief that it wasn’t needed and the prevalence of conflicting information about vaccines.

Toft said fast-spreading misinformation on social media is influencing public opinion. So is U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s introduction of “fringe ideas” to inform policy changes, she said.
“It’s moved off of Facebook feeds and onto ‘CBS Mornings’,” Toft said, adding “the decisions seem more and more politicized, and that’ll only lead to more confusion.”
A CDC vaccine committee charged with setting national guidelines around vaccine policy voted on Friday to eliminate a 34-year-old recommendation that all newborn babies receive a hepatitis B vaccine. There was a 99% drop in serious infections among children between 1990 and 2019, which is attributed to the universal vaccination policy. Recommendations for adults and unvaccinated older children will remain unchanged.
CDC vaccine committee overturns decades-old hepatitis B recommendation for newborns

The new recommendation mirrors COVID-19 guidelines changed by the same committee in September. The change at that time caused widespread confusion about the vaccine’s accessibility and if insurance companies would cover it.
“I think it’ll be a while before we see the long-lasting implications of some of these decisions they’re making,” Toft said of the committee’s decisions.
The recommendations play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible those immunizations are to the public.
South Dakota’s survey results indicate that most people place their trust in local professionals rather than national entities: 84% of respondents said their preferred source of health information is their doctor or health professional. About 95% said they “somewhat” or “to a great extent” trust their doctor or health professional with vaccine information — more than pharmacists, the state Department of Health, or the CDC. Social media and news outlets were the lowest trusted sources among respondents.
Hansen hopes health professionals take note and choose to broach immunization discussions more often with patients. Toft agreed that health professionals are the best point of contact for vaccine education.
“When we talk to vaccine-hesitant parents, we’re like, ‘Yes, ask questions. I’d love to help you. I’d love to connect you with a provider who can answer your questions,’” Toft said. “We want you to have access to information to make the best decision for you and your family.”

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
Big companies have spent years pushing Georgia to let them find and pay for new clean energy to add to the grid, in the hopes that they could then get data centers and other power-hungry facilities online faster.


Now, that concept is tantalizingly close to becoming a reality, with regulators, utility Georgia Power, and others hammering out the details of a program that could be finalized sometime next year. If approved, the framework could not only benefit companies but also reduce the need for a massive buildout of gas-fired plants that Georgia Power is planning to satiate the artificial intelligence boom.
Today, utilities are responsible for bringing the vast majority of new power projects online in the state. But over the past two years, the Clean Energy Buyers Association has negotiated to secure a commitment from Georgia Power that ​“will, for the first time, allow commercial and industrial customers to bring clean energy projects to the utility’s system,” said Katie Southworth, the deputy director for market and policy innovation in the South and Southeast at the trade group, which includes major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.


The terms of the commitment were first sketched out in a letter agreement between Georgia Power and CEBA last year and then codified in a July settlement agreement between the utility, staff at the Georgia Public Service Commission, and other stakeholders that cemented the utility’s long-term integrated resource plan.


The ​“customer-identified resource” (CIR) option will allow hyperscalers and other big commercial and industrial customers to secure gigawatts of solar, batteries, and other energy resources on their own, not just through the utility.


Letting data centers procure their own energy resources could solve a lot of problems for utilities — like the risk of sticking their customers with the cost of building power plants that may be unneeded if the AI boom goes bust. That’s a real concern for Georgia Power, which plans to spend more than $15 billion to build 10 gigawatts of new gas plants and batteries by 2031. This move could dramatically increase customers’ bills and is almost entirely motivated by gigantic — yet highly uncertain — projections of how much energy that data centers will need.


The tech giants behind most of those data centers could also benefit from being able to track down their own clean energy. The carbon-free resources would not only help in meeting hyperscalers’ aggressive climate targets; they are also likely to be cheaper and faster to build than gas plants, which face yearslong backlogs and rising costs.


The CIR option isn’t a done deal yet. Once Georgia Power, the Public Service Commission, and others work out how the program will function, the utility will file a final version in a separate docket next year.


And the plan put forth by Georgia Power this summer lacks some key features that data center companies want. A big point of contention is that it doesn’t credit the solar and batteries that customers procure as a way to meet future peaks in power demand — the same peaks Georgia Power uses to justify its gas-plant buildout.


But as it stands, CEBA sees ​“the approved CIR framework as a meaningful step toward the ​‘bring-your-own clean energy’ model,” Southworth said — a model that goes by the catchy acronym BYONCE in clean-energy social media circles.


 Opening up the playing field for clean energy

The CIR option is technically an addition to Georgia Power’s existing Clean and Renewable Energy Subscription (CARES) program, which requires the utility to secure up to 4 gigawatts of new renewable resources by 2035. CARES is a more standard ​“green tariff” program that leaves the utility in control of contracting for resources and making them available to customers under set terms, Southworth explained.


Under the CIR option, by contrast, large customers will be able to seek out their own projects directly with a developer and the utility. Georgia Power will analyze the projects and subject them to tests to establish whether they are cost-effective. Once projects are approved by Georgia Power, built, and online, customers can take credit for the power generated, both on their energy bills and in the form of renewable energy certificates. Georgia Power’s current plan allows the procurement of up to 3 gigawatts of customer-identified resources through 2035.


Letting big companies contract their own clean power is far from a new idea. Since 2014, corporate clean-energy procurements have surpassed 100 gigawatts in the United States, equal to 41% of all clean energy added to the nation’s grid over that time, according to CEBA. Tech giants have made up the lion’s share of that growth and have continued to add more capacity in 2025, despite the headwinds created by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.


But most of that investment has happened in parts of the country that operate under competitive energy markets, in which independent developers can build power plants and solar, wind, and battery farms. The Southeast lacks these markets, leaving large, vertically integrated utilities like Georgia Power in control of what gets built. Perhaps not coincidentally, Southeast utilities also have some of the country’s biggest gas-plant expansion plans.


A lot of clean energy projects could use a boost from power-hungry companies. According to the latest data from the Southern Energy Renewable Association trade group, more than 20 gigawatts of solar, battery, and hybrid solar-battery projects are now seeking grid interconnection in Georgia.


“The idea that a large customer can buy down the cost of a clean energy resource to make sure it’s brought onto the grid to benefit them and everybody else, because that’s of value to them — that’s theoretically a great concept,” said Jennifer Whitfield, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit that’s pushing Georgia regulators to find cleaner, lower-cost alternatives to Georgia Power’s proposed gas-plant expansion. ​“We’re very supportive of the process because it has the potential to be a great asset to everyone else on the grid.”


Isabella Ariza, staff attorney at the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign, said CEBA deserves credit for working to secure this option for big customers in Georgia. In fact, she identified it as one of the rare bright spots offsetting a series of decisions from Georgia Power and the Public Service Commission that environmental and consumer advocates fear will raise energy costs and climate pollution.










“They’re proposing something that makes total sense and would help some companies be able to say ​‘We’re powering our stuff with 100% clean energy,’” Ariza said of the CIR option. That’s particularly important at a time when many hyperscalers are backing away from their clean energy targets in their hunt for power for AI data centers, she noted.


 The missing piece: capacity value

Despite those benefits, the CIR framework’s omissions are substantial enough that CEBA did not join stakeholders like Walmart, the Georgia Association of Manufacturers, and the Southern Renewable Energy Association trade groups in signing on to it.


CEBA wanted companies to be able to procure a full range of carbon-free generation resources — such as geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors — rather than just renewable energy and renewables paired with batteries. The trade group also sought a pathway for customers to bring projects forward on a rolling basis more quickly than the current settlement agreement would allow.


But one of the biggest issues CEBA has with the current CIR plan is that it ​“does not recognize the full capacity value of customer-funded clean, firm resources to the grid,” Southworth said. Capacity value is a measure of how power plants, batteries, and other resources meet peak power demands during the handful of hours per year that determine how much generation and grid infrastructure utilities need to build.


That’s a significant gap. If the resources that big customers secure under the CIR aren’t considered part of the solution to this challenge — if their capacity value isn’t factored in — they may not be able to reduce Georgia Power’s need for gigawatts of gas-fired power plants, which are the traditional utility backstop for ensuring adequate energy supplies.


This would be bad for Georgia Power customers at large, who would end up paying for more gas plants than are actually needed after the data centers driving up power demand secure their own resources instead. It could also saddle data centers and other big customers with growing capacity-related costs that their self-secured projects could otherwise help reduce.


“A well-designed CIR program that recognizes the capacity value of customer-funded clean resources is a win-win-win for large customers, Georgia Power, and all ratepayers,” Southworth said. ​“Participating customers pay the incremental cost of new clean, firm projects; the utility gets capacity it can count on; and nonparticipating customers benefit from a more diverse, less gas-dependent resource mix without taking on the full cost or fuel price risk of those projects.”


CEBA has ideas for how Georgia Power could financially compensate customers for the capacity value of the resources that they procure. The utility already calculates ​“avoided capacity values” for the renewable energy, battery, and fossil-fueled resources it brings to the table in its requests for proposals. Georgia Power could provide a capacity credit of similar value to subscribing customers for the projects they procure.


CEBA will ​“continue to work with the company and commission staff,” Southworth said. Her group sees Georgia Power’s long-term plan approved this summer ​“as establishing the floor, not the ceiling, for what CIR can become.”


A big shift at the Public Service Commission could lay the groundwork for a reassessment of the program. Last month, Georgia voters elected two Democratic challengers — health care consultant Alicia Johnson and clean-energy advocate Peter Hubbard — to replace Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.


The two new commissioners have both pledged to tackle high and rising electricity costs for Georgia Power residential customers. Across the country, utilities and regulators are striving to force data center developers to take on the costs they’re imposing on power grids, rather than foisting them on everyday utility customers.


“Capacity is still an open question” that the Public Service Commission can take up as it decides on the CIR option, said Whitfield of the Southern Environmental Law Center. ​“Georgia Power is certainly on record that they don’t prefer it to be accredited, which makes sense for them. They want to build more and profit more,” as a regulated utility that earns guaranteed profits on its capital investments. ​“But that is going to be very much a live issue.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/solar--1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 15:59:28.191722
